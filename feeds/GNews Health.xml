.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also found the concentration of plastics in the body was seven to 30 times higher in the brain, compared to other organs like the liver or kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MNPs have also been linked to cell death, changes in the gut microbiome, formation of blood clots and increased risk of heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding to the study, a group of doctors offered ways to reduce to exposure to MNPs, including swapping out plastic containers when reheating food in the microwave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plastic levels were also found to be three to five times higher in people diagnosed with dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano, from the University of Ottawa's Department of Psychiatry and lead author of the commentary noted: 'The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This rise mirrors the exponential increase we're seeing in environmental microplastic levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto, explained that heating food in plastic containers can cause the release of BPA and phthalates into the air which can then get absorbed by your food and infiltrate your body when eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BPA, short for bisphenol A, and phthalates are industrial chemicals that are sometimes added to plastics as part of the manufacturing process to make them more durable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Luu said in the Eureka journal paper: 'Heating food in plastic containers—especially in the microwave can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heating plastics is one of the largest drivers of forever chemical exposure, and the Mayo Clinic warned forever chemicals found in plastics are released when the item is reheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separately, University of Nebraska researchers found in a 2023 study that microwaving plastic containers releases billions of nanoplastics and millions of microplastics per every square centimeter of a plastic container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Nebraska team further discovered that embryotic kidney cells died two days after bring exposed to those particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 study from researchers in India found when food-grade plastics or food that had been in contact with the plastic are heated, BPA is released and leaches into the food item 'and is thereby consumed, making it a potential candidate for causing serious health hazards.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto, explained that heating food in plastic containers can cause the release of BPA and phthalates in the microwave air which can contaminate the food and enter your body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

bottled to filtered tap water &lt;/a&gt;alone could reduce microplastic intake from 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90 percent, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, a world-leading fertility scientist also advised people to steer clear from using plastic containers in the microwave due to its&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14210243/World-leading-scientist-reason-never-microwave-plastic-fertility-andrew-huberman.html"&gt;

Scientists discovered that these viral antibodies mistakenly target a protein called GlialCAM in the brain, triggering autoimmune responses associated with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed how combinations of genetic risk factors and elevated viral antibodies further increase the risk of developing MS. These insights may pave the way for improved diagnostics and targeted therapies, enhancing our understanding of the genetic and immunological interplay underlying this debilitating disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistargeted Antibodies:&lt;/strong&gt; EBV antibodies mistakenly attack GlialCAM, a brain protein, potentially triggering MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Links:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific combinations of EBV antibodies and genetic risk factors substantially elevate MS risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Diagnostics:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated antibodies against GlialCAM and related proteins could serve as biomarkers for early MS detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), antibodies to the common Epstein-Barr virus can accidentally attack a protein in the brain and spinal cord. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research shows that the combination of certain viral antibodies and genetic risk factors can be linked to a greatly increased risk of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108101"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ebv-ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The absence of a protective gene variant (HLA-A*02:01) in combination with any of the antibodies against proteins in the brain was also associated with a strong increase in risk. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS &lt;/em&gt;and led by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, and Stanford University School of Medicine, USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 90 to 95 percent of adults are carriers of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and have formed antibodies against it. Many become infected as children with few or no symptoms, but in young adults, the virus can cause glandular fever. After infection, the virus remains in the body in a dormant (latent) phase without active virus production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attacking a protein in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone affected by the neurological disease MS, where the immune system attacks the brain and spinal cord, is a carrier of EBV. However, the mechanisms behind the association are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet and Stanford Medicine have confirmed that antibodies to an EBV protein called EBNA1 can inadvertently react with a similar protein in the brain called GlialCAM, which probably contributes to the development of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new study also shows how different combinations of antibodies and genetic risk factors for MS contribute to the risk increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A better understanding of these mechanisms may ultimately lead to better diagnostic tools and treatments for MS,” says Tomas Olsson, professor of neurology at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research there with professor Ingrid Kockum and assistant professor Olivia Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from 650 MS patients and 661 healthy people. They compared the levels of antibodies directed against the viral protein EBNA1 and the levels of misdirected antibodies against GlialCAM and two other proteins in the brain, ANO2 and CRYAB, which are also similar to EBNA1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased levels of antibodies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of all these antibodies were detected in people with MS. High antibody levels in combination with a genetic risk factor for MS (HLA-DRB1*15:01) were associated with a further increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a protective gene variant (HLA-A*02:01) in combination with any of the antibodies against proteins in the brain was also associated with a strong increase in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new findings provide another piece of the puzzle that adds to our understanding of how genetic and immunological factors interact in MS,” says Lawrence Steinman, professor of neurology at Stanford Medicine, who led the research there with William Robinson, professor of immunology and rheumatology, and Tobias Lanz, assistant professor of immunology and rheumatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet now plan to analyse samples collected before MS disease development to see when these antibodies appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they are already present before the onset of the disease, they may have the potential to be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis,” says Tomas Olsson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Brain Foundation, the EU/Horizon Europe, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Margaretha af Ugglas Foundation, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomas Olsson and Lawrence Steinman have received lecture and advisory board fees from several companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Robinson and Tobias Lanz are stockholders and consultants of Ebvio and Flatiron Bio and have filed a patent with Stanford University.

The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1*15:01,&lt;/em&gt; and combinations of &lt;em&gt;HLA-DRB1*15:01&lt;/em&gt; with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:06:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9hN3g5TFZpM1BGSzYzdk50MFlEdkZsUmJEekw3eWM4Z1lyWFJYNWVXdmVjUmJpZVJCMENSRE5KX3FPbXk1ODBBZC1ZaUdQZlNwNEg4RExJaEl6VlNMSzR3MTM3aG5ZVjduQUltT3A3WWVIZFhSbjdkVFBtVQ</guid></item><item><title>Microplastics may be creating antibiotic-resistance superbugs - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOamVISHJraVZwdGQ0T2RjMDZhQWU3dXAzS2d6RzFpWE9IaGF2blJWUWRLYXdHTzljeGw0LUw2c05FclhzVEZIWDZmemtwMEZ1M0tONDQ2SGpwVFBwem5HX3VLYm1Eb05PVE1WcE1xd1V2MFl6OXdmbEU0R2Nhd2xvUS1MOE56SzBERUttZnZManZaa3A5UnF5YlA3TlpHLVVv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Talk about a culture shock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/05/health/making-a-single-change-can-drastically-cut-microplastics-intake/"&gt;Microplastics&lt;/a&gt; — tiny particles that come from large plastic items and industrial waste — can damage cells and disrupt organs, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/18/health/hidden-danger-can-cause-infertility-colon-cancer-lung-problems/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/plastic-found-in-testicles-and-blood-clots-sparking-health-concerns-studies/"&gt;infertility&lt;/a&gt; and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076095?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Researchers from Boston University&lt;/a&gt; say there’s another downside to these ubiquitous shards — bacteria exposed to them can become resistant to several types of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Microplastics, like the ones pictured here, have been linked to several health concerns. Researchers from Boston University identified another downside to microplastics — bacteria exposed to them can become resistant to several types of antibiotics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;gradt – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers are particularly concerned about places where plastic litter piles up, like this temporary camp at Al-Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are believed to inhale and ingest &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tens of thousands of microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; a year. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;One recent study found&lt;/a&gt; a spoonful of them in people’s brains because they are everywhere in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that there are microplastics all around us, and even more so in impoverished places where sanitation may be limited, is a striking part of this observation,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/muhammad-zaman-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Muhammad Zaman&lt;/a&gt;, a Boston University professor of biomedical engineering who studies antimicrobial resistance and refugee and migrant health.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“There is certainly a concern that this could present a higher risk in communities that are disadvantaged,” Zaman continued, “and only underscores the need for more vigilance and a deeper insight into [microplastic and bacterial] interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance is quite common — &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-07-2023-vaccines-could-avert-half-a-million-deaths-associated-with-anti-microbial-resistance-a-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an estimated 4.95 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; occur each year worldwide due to these infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zaman blames the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/04/05/doctor-burnout-linked-to-overprescribing-opioids-antibiotics-study/"&gt;misuse and overuse of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; as well as the immediate surroundings of the microbe, where bacteria and viruses replicate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Misuse and overuse of antibiotics, like the ones shown here, can lead to antimicrobial resistance. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;torjrtrx – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;His team studied how the common bacteria E. coli reacted in a closed environment with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bacteria attached to and colonized the plastics, as they do to any surface, creating a slimy, complex coating called a biofilm. Biofilms protect bacteria from environmental stressors, antibiotics and immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biofilms on microplastics turned out to be stronger and thicker than those observed on other materials, like glass. The rate of antibiotic resistance on the microplastics was also much higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re demonstrating that the presence of plastics is doing a whole lot more than just providing a surface for the bacteria to stick — they are actually leading to the development of resistant organisms,” Zaman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most plastics repel water and other liquids — they are hydrophobic due to their molecular structure.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Zaman’s team speculated that plastics eventually take in moisture and may absorb antibiotics before they reach the bacteria they are trying to target. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.02282-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It’s unclear exactly why bacteria have such a strong hold on microplastics, like the ones shown here. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;MediaNews Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to discern the exact mechanisms that allow bacteria to have such a strong grip on plastic and study the occurrence of microplastic-related antibiotic-resistant bacteria and viruses in refugee camps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team noted that refugees, asylum seekers and forcibly displaced populations are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309924005784#:~:text=Refugees%20and%20asylum%20seekers%20are,to%20health%20and%20vaccine%20systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;particularly susceptible&lt;/a&gt; to drug-resistant infections. &lt;a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;An estimated 122 million&lt;/a&gt; people have been &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/20/study-war-climate-displaced-tens-of-millions-in-2020/"&gt;forcibly displaced worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Can you pass me the whatchamacallit? It's right over there next to the thingamajig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us will experience "lethologica", or difficulty finding words, in everyday life. And it usually becomes more prominent with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent difficulty finding the right word can signal changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://www.geriatric.theclinics.com/article/S0749-0690(22)00058-1/abstract"&gt;consistent&lt;/a&gt; with the early ("preclinical") stages of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease – before more obvious symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13825585.2024.2315774"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Toronto suggests that it's the speed of speech, rather than the difficulty in finding words that is a more accurate indicator of brain health in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers asked 125 healthy adults, aged 18 to 90, to describe a scene in detail. Recordings of these descriptions were subsequently analysed by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="154563" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) software to extract features such as speed of talking, duration of pauses between words, and the variety of words used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed a standard set of tests that measure concentration, thinking speed, and the ability to plan and carry out tasks. Age-related decline in these "executive" abilities was closely linked to the pace of a person's everyday speech, suggesting a broader decline than just difficulty in finding the right word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg" alt="People sitting at a table " class="size-full wp-image-145030" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJM9UZz3U/"&gt;Peopleimages/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel aspect of this study was the use of a "picture-word interference task", a clever task designed to separate the two steps of naming an object: finding the right word and instructing the mouth on how to say it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this task, participants were shown pictures of everyday objects (such as a broom) while being played an audio clip of a word that is either related in meaning (such as "mop" – which makes it harder to think of the picture's name) or which sounds similar (such as "groom" – which can make it easier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that the natural speech speed of older adults was related to their quickness in naming pictures. This highlights that a general slowdown in processing might underlie broader cognitive and linguistic changes with age, rather than a specific challenge in memory retrieval for words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfLP8fFrOp0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Alzheimer's explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make the findings more powerful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings from this study are interesting, finding words in response to picture-based cues may not reflect the complexity of vocabulary in unconstrained everyday conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbal fluency tasks, which require participants to generate as many words as possible from a given category (for example, animals or fruits) or starting with a specific letter within a time limit, may be used with picture-naming to better capture the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon refers to the temporary inability to retrieve a word from memory, despite partial recall and the feeling that the word is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tasks are considered a better test of everyday conversations than the picture-word interference task because they involve the active retrieval and production of words from one's vocabulary, similar to the processes involved in natural speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While verbal fluency performance does not significantly decline with normal ageing (as shown in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-022-02018-y"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;), poor performance on these tasks can indicate neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are useful because they account for the typical changes in word retrieval ability as people get older, allowing doctors to identify impairments beyond what is expected from normal ageing and potentially detect neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbal fluency test engages various brain regions involved in language, memory, and executive functioning, and hence can offer insights into which regions of the brain are affected by cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the University of Toronto study could have investigated participants' subjective experiences of word-finding difficulties alongside objective measures like speech pauses. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal reports of the "feeling" of struggling to retrieve words could offer valuable insights complementing the behavioural data, potentially leading to more powerful tools for quantifying and detecting early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145024" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AlzheimersCognitiveDecline642.jpg" alt="Senior man looking forgetful" class="size-full wp-image-145024" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AlzheimersCognitiveDecline642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AlzheimersCognitiveDecline642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145024" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The verbal fluency test can offer insights into which regions of the brain are affected by cognitive decline.(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADm4mcPaOE/"&gt;Motortion/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opening doors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this study has opened exciting doors for future research, showing that it's not just what we say but how fast we say it that can reveal cognitive changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By harnessing natural language processing technologies (a type of AI), which use computational techniques to analyse and understand human language data, this work advances previous studies that noticed subtle changes in the spoken and written language of public figures like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6922000/"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15574466/"&gt;Iris Murdoch&lt;/a&gt; in the years before their dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those opportunistic reports were based on looking back after a dementia diagnosis, this study provides a more systematic, data-driven and forward-looking approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using rapid advancements in natural language processing will allow for automatic, detection of language changes, such as slowed speech rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores the potential of speech rate changes as a significant yet subtle marker of cognitive health that could aid in identifying people at risk before more severe symptoms become apparent.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/224812/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Here are some answers to common questions about the disease, from how it presents to the durability of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is measles and why are we hearing about it now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The World Health Organization identifies measles as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination"&gt;one of the most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, killing up to three out of every thousand children globally. The disease has been preventable since 1963, when American researchers developed a vaccine. In 2000, measles was considered eliminated in the U.S., though occasional cases and outbreaks impacted mostly unvaccinated people. Currently, there are outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 6, an unvaccinated man in New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188"&gt;died of measles.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;An unvaccinated school-aged child in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; died of the virus last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola"&gt;The Texas state health department reports that 90% of non-immune people become infected&lt;/a&gt; just by being near someone with the airborne sickness. The rubeola virus that causes measles can linger in midair for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the symptoms of measles and when do they appear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says that measles symptoms — fevers of 104 degrees Fahrenheit or above, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes — appear within 14 days after an infection. Next come tiny white “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html"&gt;Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt;” on the inside of the mouth, and a rash that starts at the hairline and spreads down the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical complications can include pneumonia, deafness, blindness, encephalitis (brain swelling) and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/global-advisory-committee-on-vaccine-safety/topics/measles-vaccines#:~:text=Evidence%20was%20provided%20that%20the%20true%20incidence,000%20cases%20of%20measles%20has%20been%20cited."&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a progressive neurological disease. Children 5 and under, adults over 20, pregnant women, and immunocompromised people such as chemotherapy patients and those living with leukemia or HIV are most vulnerable to complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the vaccine requirements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Federal requirements for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) shots don’t exist, but &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/official-guidance/state-policies/vaccine-requirements/mmr-child-school-2024/"&gt;all 50 states enforce some form of measles inoculation&lt;/a&gt; for children before they enter childcare or public schools. Some states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/school/exemptions"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, allow vaccination exemptions for religious and personal beliefs. California had a similar exemption until &lt;a href="https://eziz.org/assets/docs/shotsforschool/PBEFAQs.pdf"&gt;it was eliminated in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC-recommended measles vaccination includes two shots delivered at 12-15 months and 4-6 years of age. Together, the doses are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; against measles infections. By contrast, unvaccinated people represent about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;94% of the 222 measles cases in the U.S. this year,&lt;/a&gt; and one in five unvaccinated people with measles requires hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these statistics have not deterred &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/01/as-texas-outbreak-grows-californias-measles-vaccination-rate-struggles-to-recover-after-pandemic/"&gt;a persistent anti-vaccination movement&lt;/a&gt; that expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers in &lt;a href="https://texansforvaccinechoice.com/89th-session-bill-list/"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/state-lawmakers-see-new-opportunities-to-pass-vaccine-exemptions-after-trumps-return"&gt;numerous other states&lt;/a&gt; continue pushing bills to dislodge routine vaccination from public health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A February meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; has been indefinitely postponed and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is stoking skepticism and confusion around vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; If I got vaccinated as recommended, am I OK? Isn’t the MMR vaccine good for life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; MMR vaccinations or natural immunity after a measles infection theoretically lasts a lifetime, according to Dr. Monica Gandhi an infectious disease doctor at UC San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gandhi said there has been no way to test this in the absence of the disease. “We haven’t put an 80-year-old in the situation where they’re in the middle of an outbreak in 2025,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Should older vaccinated adults, and those born before 1957 and presumed immune from the widespread infections of the pre-vaccination era, get another MMR vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Gandhi said those vaccinated decades ago should consider a measles booster if they live near an outbreak, are 65 or older, or are preparing to travel internationally, especially for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yale School of Medicine recommends that at-risk &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster"&gt;people vaccinated prior to 1968&lt;/a&gt; (57 or older) might also want a new shot, because they received doses that are less effective than vaccines that became the standard after that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Should people who work in childcare or early education get boosters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;This depends on local risk levels, Gandhi said. Vaccination rates at &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/164304"&gt;more kindergartens&lt;/a&gt; have been dipping below the 95% level previously recommended (and in California, currently enforced) for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Can children be vaccinated ahead of schedule, and can the gap between the two doses be shorter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In the event of an outbreak, Gandhi said, the first dose can be given to infants under a year old. They must be re-vaccinated on or after their first birthdays with two more doses of MMR vaccine separated by 28 days or more, or two more doses of the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine separated by 3 months or more. The CDC has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/family/vaccine-recommendations-for-infants-and-children#:~:text=Children%20traveling%20abroad%20need%20to,for%20children%2012%E2%80%9347%20months."&gt;additional guidance for infants traveling internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anyone for whom vaccination is unsafe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Severely immunocompromised people and pregnant women should not receive the live vaccine, Gandhi said. If exposed to measles, this population receives &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/antibodies/antibodies-learning-center/antibodies-resource-library/antibody-methods/introduction-immunoglobulins.html"&gt;immunoglobulins — protein antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that help the immune system fight off harmful agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation/index.html"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has been touting vitamin A and cod liver oil as alternatives to combating measles. Scientists have debunked these suggestions, but is there any credence to claims that vitamin A or other nutrients can help reduce susceptibility to severe measles?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; “I really want to downplay vitamin A as a treatment. Prevention by vaccination is the best way to combat severe measles,” Gandhi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two deaths in this country over the last month are a very big deal for a preventable infectious disease,” she said. “It’s a very big deal to lose someone in your family — it’s a lifelong tragedy. There’s simply no reason not to get the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;

I had no memory of watching it whatsoever, and I didn't watch many movies either at the time. So it was, it was a bit concerning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Fraser thought little of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until a few months before his diagnosis, in May last year, that he began experiencing 'some issues' with his cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fraser has invented ways to manage his symptoms, such as writing himself notes and asking his daughters to text him to let him know their plans, even if they've told him in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fraser struggled to 'think deeply', finding that his thoughts were unusually 'shallow' and 'surface level'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, a second major incident sparked alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fraser described a frightening evening spent driving around looking for his teenage daughter, who he mistakenly thought was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, she has gone to the cinema — a plan she'd told him about earlier that day.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I remember my daughter had told me numerous times throughout the day that she'd go to the movies that night and it would be sort of quite late with a friend,'&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nZWKD_yPp0&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt; he said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It came to night time and I started freaking out, thinking, where's my daughter? I was driving to the nearby town trying to see if other friends had heard from her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And and it got to a point where I was about to ring the police, I was that concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'd been trying to call her, trying to phone message, trying to message her, and just not getting through to her at all. So yeah, really freaking out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then she ends up calling me, saying, like, "hey dad, I've just been in the movies. Remember, I told you?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These symptoms can be symptoms of mental illness, but they can also be a sign of dementia — the memory-robbing condition plaguing nearly 1million Brits and 7million Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon afterwards, Fraser sought medical help for his cognition problems, and was eventually given the life-changing diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's disease, aged 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only between five to 10 per cent of Alzheimer's cases are diagnosed in those under 65, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average time to diagnosis is 4.4 years in younger people, compared to 2.2 years for people aged over 65, according to charity Dementia UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In the overwhelming majority of cases, Alzheimer's disease is not inherited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, faulty genes inherited from parents are much more likely to be a contributing factor in those diagnosed with the condition in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society: 'In the really rare cases of a person developing Alzheimer’s disease in their 30s and 40s, it’s almost always because of a faulty gene.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since his diagnosis, Fraser has noticed other symptoms, which can be challenging to manage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke recently announced she has been diagnosed with dementia. The condition was spotted when she was just 61  - and is classed as early onset disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I muddle up things when it comes to everyday scheduling,' he said. 'If someone organised something and then the plans change, I'll nearly always remember the first plan so I'll stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A fog just comes over your brain and you just can't really focus on things very well and you're in a haze.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past six months Fraser has 'forgotten' how to do things he's practiced 'a thousand times', like turning off the shower and driving his partner's car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he's still able to go to work, and does not feel as though the symptoms are controlling him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he is increasingly finding himself exhausted at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brain has had enough,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:46:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPSTN6eXQ4aExiQnpNM3drWjV3RE9YdEN2eWdEck4tMFJ6UUZ2cTZoTnlLR1pVZGR4Z3RyekUtVGtFWVlNZnpCSzhfVVd4V0ZxUWY1eEUwcEItT1N1M1cxWU5RaXBTUWx2U2U1dUVKU1dCREhqUzVrMVNBUWJualNVSFYtdDFXRUFxcTNTY0trN20yYzY2NFVwWUNucWM5YXM2WUZwZjdLS3hSQdIBrwFBVV95cUxNTjFQd0RaRjNrR0dvaWxqV29HVGtGMDJUOGhnbF9qdVVYYWdvd3M0bFdBMENfbFJBODZOOGpIRDNraTB1RHpsR0hfcmJ4MzhITFU5cGJYZjJkbE8tQTdkX1ZRVDlQWHJHN1pPa1BEZi1jNzA3Vmh3SF9GRTVrbHZuejREbXNwLVl5T0ItdUlfNjhkSFN3enRpR0pZRjUwemxRLVlNR0ljYWNDNkdRQUhj</guid></item><item><title>Can I get weight loss drugs on the NHS in Scotland? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE45OFlKNzNwOG9WU0cwRExvSGhsenpTcGFWWnY1c1JMY3dra01wb2VoTmQycXBBbEhtTDZySlFLWVBPaUF1VTY5UHoxLTV4bjVOUXFFVEh4TEIxQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5wSGphamRzeVRvbmVTTk8tZ1RBeGhxWF9rMkxjamNnUDFYcy0wTGlYalp4OXdoeGw3Z19hSGo4S05RdlhkbFVaZUIzR2tiUi1EcUR1eXhua3FTOVZOYzRj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Who can get weight loss drugs on the NHS in Scotland?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Lisa Summers and Claire McAllister&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Scotland news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2373/live/a5b153d0-fdb3-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Angela Chesworth Two pictures of Angela Chesworth.

It has also been licensed under the brand name Ozempic for treating diabetes in some circumstances, but not for weight loss in this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, another drug called tirzepatide was approved specifically for weight loss by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) under the brand name Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since 2022, a third drug, liraglutide, has been approved under the name of Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But all of these medications currently come with strict criteria for their prescription on the NHS as part of a phased introduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In phase one, they may only be prescribed to patients who have a BMI over 38 and at least one pre-existing weight-related health condition, such as high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Further phases will be planned when the evidence of prescribing data and outcomes has been analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Scottish government said the aim of the phased introduction was "to ensure sustainable access for patients who need it most".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the use of the drugs is limited on the NHS, they can also be bought privately – but pharmacists and doctors have warned of risks to patient safety through online sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stricter checks were brought in last month to require in-person or video consultations, along with information from GP or medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;How many people are getting them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Most Scottish health boards are not currently prescribing Mounjaro or Wegovy for weight loss, which means that very few people are currently getting the drugs on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Freedom of Information requests by BBC News established that 5,866 people are currently being seen by specialist weight services in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Another 8,756 people are on waiting lists, and doctors said the number of people eligible for weight loss drugs was far higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, the health boards were unable to say how many people were getting Mounjaro or Wegovy specifically for weight loss on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After the SMC granted approval, there was concern that not all health boards had a weight management service model to support the recommendations - and that the potential level of uptake, along with ongoing supply issues, could pose a challenge for budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Any patients to be prescribed the drugs on the NHS would need to see a specialist before starting the injections, and there are long waits for weight management services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;We asked all 14 regional health boards to tell us how many patients were receiving Wegovy or Mounjaro specifically for weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The majority told us that because they can also be prescribed for patients with Type 2 diabetes, they were unable to distinguish whether they had been prescribed solely for weight loss purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Addy Mohammed, co-founder of Simple Online Pharmacy, said the latest data from pharmacy wholesalers suggested that more than a million people in the UK were now privately accessing weight loss medications -

"A lack of evidence doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's just that people haven't studied it," he reflects. "That's not always a satisfying situation or answer, but it's just what you have to deal with sometimes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxb2nm.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy The enzymes we use to digest meat are the same that break down other proteins (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The enzymes we use to digest meat are the same that break down other proteins (Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is possible – though it is very rare – to be allergic to meat. Alpha-gal syndrome, in which the immune system recognises animal proteins as invaders, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20160201-a-tick-bite-that-makes-you-allergic-to-red-meat" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;can lead to anaphylaxis and death&lt;/a&gt;. But this allergy, which can crop up after a lifetime of cheerful meat eating, is not related to switching to a low-meat diet. You can, for example, develop the condition after a tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For many who are avoiding meat, discovering that they have unknowingly consumed it can be emotionally painful – it can feel like a personal violation, says Kersten, who is a vegetarian himself. "That would make some people extremely sad," he explains. " I don't know if that would lead to physical symptoms. It certainly could trigger a lot of anger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But when you consider the biology of digestion, it is not as plausible as you might imagine that the body could, over a long period of time, lose the ability to digest meat. Meat is generally very easily digested, unlike the fibre in fruits, vegetables, and legumes. To break that up, our bodies require help from our microbiome, whose microbes do possess the enzymes necessary for digesting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;The human gut microbiome does morph and change depending on what its host eats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Moreover, the enzymes used to digest plant proteins are the same as those used on meat proteins. These enzymes recognise and sever particular chemical bonds in proteins. Whether they come from plants or animals, the proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids. Enzymes can generally break them up no matter where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This process is different from the case of, say, animal milk sugars like lactose. To digest lactose, your body requires a specific enzyme called lactase, and people who do not produce enough of the enzyme, making them lactose intolerants, can suffer a tummy upset after eating dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But with meat proteins, it does not make sense to think of the body somehow ceasing to make the enzymes necessary to digest a hamburger comfortably – they're always there, breaking down any protein that comes through, be it from pea, soybeans, or steaks, says Kersten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxb3ff.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Alamy Fibre-filled fruits and vegetables are actually more likely to cause digestive issues (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Fibre-filled fruits and vegetables are actually more likely to cause digestive issues (Credit: Alamy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The human gut microbiome does morph and change depending on what its host eats, though. Sometimes this means that the specific types of bacteria there change; sometimes it's just that the microbes make other enzymes. While there are differences between the microbiomes of omnivores and vegetarians and vegans, they &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5250259/how-meat-eaters-can-have-gut-microbes-as-healthy-as-vegans" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;do not seem to be radically divergent&lt;/a&gt;, so long as the omnivores consume a variety of plants, research has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Microbiomes can shift quickly as a result of dietary changes, however – one study in which people switched to a fully animal-based diet showed that a shift away from their baseline microbiome &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3957428/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;was visible within a day&lt;/a&gt; (it swiftly reverted back to normal once the diet ended). Subjects were encouraged to report any discomfort they felt, but nothing made it into the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If anything, it's the sudden consumption of large amounts of fibre after a long hiatus that could cause digestive problems. It's better to ease into such dietary changes.

Older rats showed more brain inflammation after three months as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diets in the study had 60% of calories coming from fat, which &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/high-fat-diet-memory-aging-28469/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neuroscience News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/high-fat-diet-memory-aging-28469/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; is equivalent to the amount in a Burger King Double Whopper with cheese or a McDonald's Double Smoky BLT Quarter Pounder with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/one-thing-to-avoid-eating-for-your-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Thing To Avoid Eating For Your Brain Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Thing To Avoid Eating For Your Brain Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted tests on two separate parts of the brain and types of memory: The hippocampus (the main memory center of the brain) and the amygdala, which is where the "cued fear memory" is centered (and can trigger fear, anxiety, fight-or-flight response and threat detection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These diets lead to obesity-related changes in both young and old animals, yet young animals appear more resilient to the high-fat diet’s effects on memory. We think it is likely due to their ability to activate compensatory anti-inflammatory responses, which the aged animals lack," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/psychiatry-and-behavioral-health/ruth-m-barrientos-phd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ruth Barrientos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Ruth Barrientos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, study lead author, investigator at Ohio State University's Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research and associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health and neuroscience at Ohio State University College of Medicine, said. "Also, with glucose, insulin and adipose inflammation all increased in both young and old animals, there's no way to distinguish what is causing memory impairment in only old animals if you look only at what's happening in the body. It's what is happening in the brain that's important for the memory response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-food-for-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Is the Worst Food for Brain Health?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Is the Worst Food for Brain Health?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OK, But What Does This Rat Study Have to Do With Me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe nothing! (Hopefully, anyway!) However, researchers note that the study's purpose was to show that high-fat diets may impact health, including brain health, outside of obesity—and that research must be done to see the impacts of our diet and nutrition on our brains and the rest of our bodies, regardless of how much we weigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable," Dr. Barrientos said. "We're really looking for the effects of the diet directly on the brain. We showed that within three days, long before obesity sets in, tremendous neuroinflammatory shifts are occurring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in the body in all animals are happening more slowly and aren't actually necessary to cause the memory impairments and changes in the brain," Dr. Barrientos added. "We never would have known that brain inflammation is the primary cause of high-fat diet-induced memory impairments without comparing the two timelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1247845/kaitlin-vogel/favonoid-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: New Research Says Consuming Fruits and Veggies Can Do Wonders for Brain Health—Here's How to Get More In Your Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: New Research Says Consuming Fruits and Veggies Can Do Wonders for Brain Health—Here's How to Get More In Your Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE41M2x6MHZSNHFOOGNjMmQxUjZkMWVnWTVGNFFBazEtT3FySVpnVXlKc2oyek04TlNLZEc2YmlPWVBxUGVIX0ttdGdOczY4M0RKUU5UN1ZEbWh2NjdTM0FZYWxkaDNCNGJHSUhwWGZoc1htMUI0VlFTRG84SE8</guid></item><item><title>Axios-Ipsos poll: COVID's enduring divides - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPOUdDSUVHNVRlemlTaThOTGxVaEp1dWRBYWZ5OFFsenFFTmRJWFdlVC1KSjRCcnFCN0VnMDRSd3A1bk9BUDdyMDlLaVZuc1laaWJIMkplbmYyX1ZGOFRNUnl6WGFkNWQ2NzFOUExYbVNUTEc0MFZyMUZuWGozd2Z1Z2ZDTFV4RWg5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:32:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPOUdDSUVHNVRlemlTaThOTGxVaEp1dWRBYWZ5OFFsenFFTmRJWFdlVC1KSjRCcnFCN0VnMDRSd3A1bk9BUDdyMDlLaVZuc1laaWJIMkplbmYyX1ZGOFRNUnl6WGFkNWQ2NzFOUExYbVNUTEc0MFZyMUZuWGozd2Z1Z2ZDTFV4RWg5</guid></item><item><title>Low-Carb Diets May Fuel Colorectal Cancer, Concerning New Study Reveals - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGpfSUdYc3pmSllyWk5OdngxbHZHWlIxOXYxWkJRbWttc04xQVV4MWprUnZwcGJ3Z0lXaEhWZlV4bFV1ekJfZVpDNjcxN3hWeHFxRHlWNlI1VWFnWVNHTnRsMnp1b29fU3ZhM3NEdWdlajhXN0lDUWlpdm5CZGl5R1h6UDRwdUhvRm41ZFNnUTl1NVdzMnNxQ1E3VXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGpfSUdYc3pmSllyWk5OdngxbHZHWlIxOXYxWkJRbWttc04xQVV4MWprUnZwcGJ3Z0lXaEhWZlV4bFV1ekJfZVpDNjcxN3hWeHFxRHlWNlI1VWFnWVNHTnRsMnp1b29fU3ZhM3NEdWdlajhXN0lDUWlpdm5CZGl5R1h6UDRwdUhvRm41ZFNnUTl1NVdzMnNxQ1E3VXM</guid></item><item><title>Millions living with hidden condition that causes sudden heart attacks... are you one of them?

Muscle weakness, hair loss, shiny skin, skin that is cool to the touch, and cold or numb toes are also common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes or are obese are all at higher risk for developing PAD, as these factors narrow blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within five years of a PAD diagnosis, one in three patients will die, and one in five will suffer a heart attack or stroke, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While PAD affects men and women almost equally, the researchers found women are more likely to experience either no symptoms at all or easily dismissed symptoms, such as walking at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could lead to the disease progressing further, increasing the risk of deadly complications like stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic from the American Heart Association's report shows the types of PVD women are at an increased risk of compared to men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women with aortopathy - conditions affecting the heart's main muscle, the aorta - tend to be diagnosed at older ages and with more severe forms of the disease than men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is despite having a lower risk of aortic conditions like aneurysms, as estrogen can protect against them by reducing the amount of enzymes that would weaken blood vessel walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing a study from the UK, the team found women were three times more likely than men to have an aneursym rupture. Additionally, 30 percent of ruptures in women occurred with small aneurysms compared to eight percent in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When an aneurysm - a bulging wall in a blood vessel - bursts, it leads to potentially deadly internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women undergoing surgery to repair their aorta were also more likely than men to suffer as stroke or die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women are up to nine times more likely than men to suffer fibromuscular dysplasia, which causes thickening and narrowing of the arteries without plaque buildup, reducing blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects roughly 12 in 100,000 Americans and can lead to stroke and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association researchers called for increased research on PVD in women, such as by including more women in clinical trials, analyzing sex differences in trials, and looking at treatment strategies targeted specifically in women.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kim said: 'PVD leads to significant illness and health complications. However, the disparities between women and men hinder equitable outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Identified disparities in effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care underscore the importance of tailored prevention and treatment strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Muscle weakness, hair loss, shiny skin, skin that is cool to the touch, and cold or numb toes are also common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who smoke, have high blood pressure, diabetes or are obese are all at higher risk for developing PAD, as these factors narrow blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within five years of a PAD diagnosis, one in three patients will die, and one in five will suffer a heart attack or stroke, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While PAD affects men and women almost equally, the researchers found women are more likely to experience either no symptoms at all or easily dismissed symptoms, such as walking at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could lead to the disease progressing further, increasing the risk of deadly complications like stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic from the American Heart Association's report shows the types of PVD women are at an increased risk of compared to men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women with aortopathy - conditions affecting the heart's main muscle, the aorta - tend to be diagnosed at older ages and with more severe forms of the disease than men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is despite having a lower risk of aortic conditions like aneurysms, as estrogen can protect against them by reducing the amount of enzymes that would weaken blood vessel walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing a study from the UK, the team found women were three times more likely than men to have an aneursym rupture. Additionally, 30 percent of ruptures in women occurred with small aneurysms compared to eight percent in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When an aneurysm - a bulging wall in a blood vessel - bursts, it leads to potentially deadly internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women undergoing surgery to repair their aorta were also more likely than men to suffer as stroke or die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, women are up to nine times more likely than men to suffer fibromuscular dysplasia, which causes thickening and narrowing of the arteries without plaque buildup, reducing blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects roughly 12 in 100,000 Americans and can lead to stroke and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association researchers called for increased research on PVD in women, such as by including more women in clinical trials, analyzing sex differences in trials, and looking at treatment strategies targeted specifically in women.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kim said: 'PVD leads to significant illness and health complications. However, the disparities between women and men hinder equitable outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Identified disparities in effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care underscore the importance of tailored prevention and treatment strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to purge conflicts of interest from the government agencies he's now in charge of, alleging close ties between employees and the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his confirmation hearings for the role, he took aim at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/15/nx-s1-5293507/cdc-rfk-vaccine-advice" target="_blank"&gt;plays a key role&lt;/a&gt; in setting policies around vaccine schedules and access, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNKI2ORzEVc" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy said&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 29 of the committee: "I think 97% of the people on it had conflicts. I think we need to end those conflicts and make sure that scientists are doing unobstructed science." He was citing an older government report on ethics disclosures, which he said came from a "government oversight investigation committee."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR tracked down &lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2009/cdcs-ethics-program-for-special-government-employees-on-federal-advisory-committees/" target="_blank"&gt;that 2009 report&lt;/a&gt;, spoke with those involved with the CDC's vaccine advisory committee at the time, and learned that Kennedy's statement about it is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Right now, what we're getting is a total misrepresentation of a 20-year-old report, about a process that was already being improved before that report was issued," says &lt;a href="https://resolvetosavelives.org/about/team/dr-tom-frieden" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Tom Frieden&lt;/a&gt;, CDC director from 2009 to 2017. He signed the agency's&lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/documents/evaluation/2517/OEI-04-07-00260-Complete%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; letter in response&lt;/a&gt; to the report in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy reiterated his view, asserting that the agency's federal advisory panels are filled with members that have "severe, severe conflicts of interest" in a subsequent appearance &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368793267112" target="_blank"&gt;on Fox News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These statements have raised concerns with public health advocates that Kennedy may be laying the groundwork to kick members off the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, and replace them with members more aligned with his past advocacy work against vaccines. Prior to his current role, Kennedy founded the anti-vaccine organization Children's Health Defense and served as the group's chairman &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;from 2015 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the panel members are replaced with others less committed to preventing diseases with vaccines, "you could get worse recommendations or you could make vaccines less accessible," says Dr. Walter Orenstein, who served as director of the U.S. immunization program at the CDC from 1988 to 2004 and is now professor emeritus at the Emory School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Conflicts of interest have always been declared and documented at public vaccine advisory committee meetings, but on Friday, Kennedy's team pulled together the last 25 years of conflicts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/disclosures/by-member.html#cc-widget-b787" target="_blank"&gt;on a list&lt;/a&gt; and posted it to the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Rather than conflicts of interest being buried within meeting minutes, this tool quickly provides the public with ACIP members' conflicts of interest," Andrew Nixon, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote to NPR in an email.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment on this story, Nixon said: "Secretary Kennedy is committed to ensuring radical transparency across HHS."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Most problems on disclosures were paperwork errors&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 2009 report, titled "&lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/reports/all/2009/cdcs-ethics-program-for-special-government-employees-on-federal-advisory-committees/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC's Ethics Program for Special Government Employees on Federal Advisory Committees&lt;/a&gt;" comes from the Office of Inspector General for HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an audit of ethics paperwork filed in 2007. It covers all 17 CDC advisory committees at the time, comprising around 250 members who gave guidance on topics like smoking, tuberculosis, and improving clinical labs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The review, contrary to Kennedy's characterization, it did not find serious conflicts among most members. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What it found was problems with committee members' disclosure paperwork: 97% of the financial disclosure forms filed contained errors or omissions, such as people putting information in the wrong section of the form or incompletely filling out a section, or reviewers forgetting to initial and date amendments to the pages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Dale Morse, who chaired the CDC's vaccine advisory committee from 2007 to 2009, remembers working through &lt;a href="https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/OGE%20Forms/2026049D943E0C34852585B6005A23CE/$FILE/OGE%20Form%20450%20Confidential%20Financial%20Disclosure%20Report.pdf?open" target="_blank"&gt;those forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a painful process — like doing your taxes but worse," he says. "You had to list every single category that was listed in [each] portfolio," such as naming each stock or mutual fund held in a retirement account.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Compared to other committees he's served on, Morse says that he thinks ACIP "would be the most complete," in terms of compliance with ethics requirements, Morse says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But it's hard to say for sure because the report does not break down the analysis by specific committee, and that information is not accessible, said Melissa Rumley, public affairs specialist in the HHS Office of Inspector General, in response to an inquiry from NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She added that she "cannot confirm" that Kennedy's statement about ACIP "was true at the time of our review."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To Frieden, the way that Kennedy characterizes the report amounts to "classic misinformation." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You start with something that has a kernel of truth — that there was a problem with completing these forms," he says. "And you conflate that [by saying] there are conflicts of interest, which in this case, is absolutely false."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to actual conflicts of interest that should have been addressed, the number in the report is dramatically less than Kennedy alleged.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report finds that seven out of 246 members across the CDC's advisory committees voted on issues they were explicitly not allowed to vote on. All were on the same committee, though the report does not name which one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I believe that the report is accurate, but when you get down to things that might have been a problem, it's down to 3%," says Dr. Carol Baker, a member of the vaccine advisory committee from 2006 to 2012, who served as chair after Morse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is a clear policy violation, so the Office of the Inspector General investigated these cases — and determined that they "did not rise to the level of criminal violations" but stemmed largely from CDC's "systemic lack of oversight" at the time, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report also faulted CDC for not identifying &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; conflicts of interest for 58% of committee members. In response, the agency said that the report overstated the problem since it counted a category that was considered exempt: researchers employed by an institution that has any grants related to committee matters, even if they're run by other researchers in different departments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Taking conflicts of interest seriously&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine advisory committee was strict, in enforcing ethics rules, Baker recalls. Back in 2006, she was an hour or two into her first public meeting as a new voting member, when a CDC staffer interrupted the proceedings. "She tapped me on the shoulder and said, 'Come with me now.' I said, 'Should I bring my purse?' — 'No, bring nothing.' It was dramatic being asked to leave the meeting," Baker says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The staffer from CDC's legal team erroneously believed that Baker had a "serious conflict" of interest based on the forms she had submitted, and escorted her from the meeting. "It turned out it was just a clerical error," Baker says, but the fact that she was nearly kicked out of her first meeting because they thought she had a conflict of interest reflects how seriously they took the issue, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several recent ACIP members who have gone through the process within the past five years told NPR the process is intensive. They've filled out those forms for themselves and their family members, and had interviews with CDC staff tasked with managing conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's been such a public eye on the committee — even more so in the past decade," said one former member, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation. "The process was very, very rigorous."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Members must declare financial ties and relationships they have with vaccine companies, and sever those that conflict with their ability to serve on the advisory committee, which is a voluntary, unpaid position.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those past ties often exist for valid research purposes, says the former ACIP member: "We're not shilling for the manufacturer — we're trying to answer scientific questions." Researchers sometimes work with manufacturers to test their products in studies, or to give advice on best practices.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Baker, who is known by her peers as the "&lt;a href="https://www.sabin.org/resources/dr-carol-baker-receives-2019-albert-b-sabin-gold-medal/" target="_blank"&gt;godmother of Group B &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; prevention,&lt;/a&gt;" recalls giving up her involvement with a company developing a vaccine against the bacteria to serve on ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a big sacrifice personally," Baker says. She had made a key scientific discovery that led to the vaccine. "I was very emotionally involved, and they felt I was the best person to give them advice and they paid me for my time, which I think is fair."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On joining the vaccine advisory committee, she cut ties with the company for six years. Serving the public mattered more: "I thought I could do more good in my life to prevent children from getting sick or being damaged or even dying by my work on ACIP," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Misleading statements could sow doubt about vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Frieden, the former CDC director, agrees that conflicts of interest are cause for concern. "It is important to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. It is important that any potential conflict of interest that may unduly influence a recommendation be investigated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, Frieden says Kennedy's misleading statements "can undermine confidence in what is a very transparent, fact-based process," in which the committee debates and makes vaccine policies in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvrp9iOILTQb6D9e1YZWpbUvzfptNMKx2" target="_blank"&gt;public live streamed meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy's team has already postponed or canceled some public meetings &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304233/cdc-vaccine-meeting-delayed" target="_blank"&gt;of the CDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311670/the-fda-has-canceled-an-important-upcoming-meeting-about-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;FDA vaccine advisory&lt;/a&gt; committees that would have addressed topics such as "how to protect infants from meningitis, which travelers should get a new vaccine that would prevent severe prolonged joint pain," and how flu vaccines should be updated, Frieden says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sowing doubts on the integrity of vaccine policymaking could lead to fewer people getting routine vaccines, says Orenstein at Emory. "It really scares me. I've seen measles, I've seen polio cases," he says. "I am very, very concerned that what is happening now will lead to more decreases in vaccine uptake and the return of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It also hampers the development of new and better vaccines that could have led to a healthier future, Orenstein says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes across the federal government?

&lt;p&gt;Since the coronavirus outbreak was acknowledged as a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic/"&gt;pandemic exactly five years ago&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic has killed well over 1 million Americans, derailed the global economy, and sparked political upheaval that continues today. It also yielded what many hail as the greatest scientific accomplishment in human history: the development of effective vaccines in under a year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet in dominating the early 2020s, Covid-19 also distracted from what is arguably a more significant public health emergency. Even at the height of the pandemic, more young Americans died of drug overdose than Covid. And in the last year, the overall death toll from the country’s drug crisis has exceeded the Covid-19 pandemic as the deadliest health event this generation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Amidst all of this very tragic loss of life in the Covid pandemic, we lost sight of the fact that more young people were dying from drug overdoses than from Covid,” Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a recent interview. “I was just exasperated. … Nobody was paying attention, or putting in the resources necessary to actually treat them, and prevent those deaths.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 1.25 million people have died of non-alcohol drug overdose between 1999 and 2024, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, putting the crisis a tick ahead of overall U.S. deaths from Covid-19. With roughly 85,000 overdose deaths still occurring annually, the gap is sure to grow. &lt;/p&gt;


		
		



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drug deaths’ reemergence as the No. 1  driver of accidental deaths in the past quarter-century is a grim reminder that the overdose crisis continues largely unabated. In recent decades, waves of addiction and overdose driven first by prescription painkillers, then heroin, then fentanyl, and now a deadly mix of fentanyl and stimulants has destroyed families, significantly slowed the U.S. economy, and even shortened the country’s overall life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It highlights, also, a jarring disconnect between the nation’s response to the two health emergencies, and the degree to which the Covid-19 pandemic helped erase what little momentum the nation’s drug crisis response had left. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In interviews, leading addiction experts at medical societies, government research agencies, and nonprofit advocacy groups uniformly agreed that the country has failed to adequately respond to the overdose crisis since it began around 1999. They assigned blame to a number of factors: fragmented leadership, stigma and misinformation about addiction, failure to recognize it as a medical condition. Most acutely, they argued that many Americans simply lack sympathy or a sense of urgency — and above all, the efforts that do exist generally lack the funds they need to be truly effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The call to action really has to get some funding support behind it,” said Patty McCarthy, the CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group Faces &amp;amp; Voices of Recovery. “We know what we need to do. We don’t need to continue to debate the solutions. We just need to put a coordinated effort behind it to make a system that works for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if urgency is lacking, the impact of the problem reverberates. Beyond the death toll, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589871X19301470#:~:text=drug%20overdose%20deaths.-,When%20corrected%20for%20these%20losses%2C%20the%20annual%20cost%20from%20the,(GDP)%20%5B2%5D." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt; say drug addiction causes economic damage equivalent to 2% of the gross domestic product. Overdose deaths skyrocketed when  Covid-19 arrived and caused widespread social isolation, just as the illicit drug supply was growing more toxic. While the current annual death toll has fallen well below its peak of roughly 114,000 in early 2023, drug overdose remains a leading cause of accidental death. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The country’s response to the two crises, however, is a jarring case study in the singular nature of America’s Covid-19 response — and by contrast, how little attention people pay to the addiction crisis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the immediate response to Covid, public officials encouraged strict social isolation protocols, poured billions into the development of vaccines and therapeutics, and then spent billions more on support programs for Americans suffering in the wake of Covid-related economic collapse. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The country’s response to the addiction crisis, by contrast, has been defined more by rhetoric than by action. Four successive presidential administrations — Obama, Trump, Biden, and now Trump again — have cited the opioid crisis as a key domestic policy priority. Many members of Congress have introduced and even passed bills on specific aspects of policy related to addiction treatment or law enforcement.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But none of these efforts ever came close to matching the scope of the federal drive that resulted in the first Americans receiving vaccines in December 2020, less than a year after Covid-19 made its presence known. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $18 billion vaccine effort, known as Operation Warp Speed and executed in partnership with Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, and other drug companies, stands in stark contrast to the continued lack of funding for overdose prevention and new addiction treatment medications. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Brian Hurley, the president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, argued in an interview that even the medications that already exist, like methadone and buprenorphine, remain underutilized, and the federal government hasn’t done enough to encourage their use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While regulations surrounding methadone and buprenorphine have been moderated in recent years, the medications remain difficult to obtain, as documented in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/category/war-on-recovery/"&gt;“The War on Recovery,”&lt;/a&gt; a STAT investigative series. Doctors are not allowed to prescribe methadone, meaning the medication is only available at specialized clinics, and few physicians prescribe buprenorphine. Many pharmacies refuse to stock buprenorphine, and many incarcerated people are also denied access to the medications, in violation of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-guidance-protections-people-opioid-use-disorder-under-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;guidance issued in 2022&lt;/a&gt; by the Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the adoption and spread of vaccination versus the adoption and spread of medications for opioid use disorder, they’re light years apart,” he said. “I am not in any way taking away from that considerable investment in vaccination technology, but we would love to see big, bold action around access to addiction medications.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To this day, only a minority of people with opioid addiction receive methadone or buprenorphine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another factor that could explain the gap in response, Hurley said, is that many Americans’ attitude toward people who use drugs remains more moralistic than compassionate. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s decades of literature making it clear that addiction is a chronic illness, but I don’t know that everyone thinks of it that way,” Hurley said. “There was very clear alignment that a virus-driven pandemic is a medical illness. It really wasn’t up for debate&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all addiction-related news is cause for despair, however. After peaking in early 2023, drug deaths began to plummet, and the rolling 12-month death toll has steadily dropped for each period the CDC has published data, with the most recent update showing a continued decline through last September. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Volkow, the NIDA director, said it was difficult to attribute the declining death rates to a single cause, citing a combination of factors including a less toxic drug supply and the fact that the crisis has already claimed the lives of many of the most vulnerable drug users. She underscored, too, that improved access to certain treatment and harm reduction measures has worked as intended, resulting in greater medication uptake and fewer fatal overdoses.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But she cautioned that the declining deaths are not happening universally — deaths are still on the rise in specific states, like Nevada and Alaska, as well as in specific demographic groups, including among Black and Native American people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The availability of Covid-level funding, too, could soon become a reality, thanks to billions of dollars that have begun to flow toward states, local and tribal governments, from settlements reached by drug manufacturers and distributors who played a role in accelerating the opioid crisis in the 1990s and early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The local recipients often have broad leeway when it comes to how the funds are spent. Much of the money has gone toward direct remediation efforts, like childhood education about drug use, purchasing naloxone and fentanyl test strips, or expanding access to addiction medications. Some localities, however, have used the money for administrative costs or to pad local governments’ rainy-day funds. Much of the money still hasn’t been spent.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But McCarthy, the Faces &amp;amp; Voices of Recovery CEO, said the settlement funds process so far has fallen short of its potential, and that the spending strategy hasn’t been guided by the type of sweeping, transformative vision the current crisis requires. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing is a really missed opportunity to do something significant,” she said. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Isolation kills, stigma kills, and we could do better.”&lt;/p&gt;

It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1160.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;general warning&lt;/a&gt; about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of "altered" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than £150,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant," she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1943/live/d45b4b10-fb46-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Picture of the GSK London headquaters.

A "common" side effect of any medicine is considered to only affect 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The drugs - which are also used to treat schizophrenia - work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the "happy hormone" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But agonist drugs can over-stimulate these feelings and under-stimulate the appreciation of consequences - leading to impulsive behaviour, according to academics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Sue told us she accumulated gambling debts of £80,000&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as "deviant behaviour"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his "libido problem subsequently resolved" after his dose was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out "uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges "intensified" after the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prevalence rates of what GSK calls "deviant" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be "devastating".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42441425" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;RLS is believed to affect&lt;/a&gt; about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The 20 sufferers we spoke to say not only had doctors failed to tell them of the potentially serious side effects of the drugs, but also failed to review the impact of the medication on their bodies subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sarah was in her 50s when she was prescribed another dopamine agonist drug made by a different manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Previously I'd have had no interest if Brad Pitt walked in the room naked," she says.

She also began shopping compulsively - ending up with £30,000 of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills.

"But at the time I didn't know it was no fault of my own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A class action was brought against GSK in 2011 by four sufferers of Parkinson's disease - the BBC has learned. They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cases of serious side effects have also been reported in other countries, particularly in relation to the use of drugs for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In France, a court awarded damages to a father of two who complained that Ropinirole had given him compulsive homosexual urges, while another man without a criminal record began torturing cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends the drugs should only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;A fourth woman, Lucy, says she lost "a decade of her to life" to compulsive gambling and risky sex after being prescribed a partial dopamine agonist, Aripiprazole, for mental health problems&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist, says the drugs still play an important role but he believes that drug companies, health authorities and doctors need to better warn patients of these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Not everybody knows the kinds of really quite dramatic changes that can occur," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a statement, GSK told the BBC Ropinirole had been prescribed for more than 17 million treatments and undergone "extensive clinical trials". It added the drug had proven to be effective and had a "well-characterised safety profile".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In response to its 2003 research that had found a link with "deviant" sexual behaviour, GSK told us this was shared with health authorities and had informed updates in prescribing information - which now lists "altered or increased sexual interest" and "behaviour of significant concern" as side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The current &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/files/pil.1160.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;patient information leaflet for Ropinirole&lt;/a&gt; makes specific reference to changes in sexual interest on five occasions - almost exclusively warning about the frequency or strength of such feelings as potentially "abnormally high", "excessive" or "increase[d]".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said that while a specific reference to "deviant" sexual behaviour is not included in warnings, such impulses vary and a general warning about activities which may be harmful is included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also said that it is important for healthcare professionals to explain the possible risk to patients and not all experience these types of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="some-names-have-been-changed-in-this-article-to-protect-people's-identities." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Some names have been changed in this article to protect people's identities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:36:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1sSzBTdXBiZ2FSdWJqajZkVU9IcEhTLTRDMng0dEZJankxLTE2UFloRERvX09OUHIzdFlqWTJQRk1OZDFrM3kxNV9qTnNaeHdmMzBWLXpHYTlpd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1tYmhpY3JEREo0QXNCRGFMZWhUNFAyZkstSWpjXzBKLUVjaUFKNzl1T2VMd05sUFd1MjZLTXRWaGFDNExpUW1SOUgxYUNrOGJXZU9hTmlHemJFakV2UzZR</guid></item><item><title>Why Are Cats Such a Medical Black Box?

Olive, a longhaired tortoiseshell kitten who had been the runt of her litter, was naturally quiet and skittish, prone to hiding in closets and napping behind the shower curtain. That made her hard to read — and sometimes simply to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But days earlier, we had started wondering whether she might be sick. Did she seem even more reserved than usual? It was hard to say, but we decided to ask her vet just to be safe. The vet immediately noticed that Olive’s gums were pale and that her heart was racing. A quick blood test revealed that she was severely anemic, with a blood-cell volume so low, the vet said, it was “incompatible with life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So began a monthslong ordeal featuring repeated visits to the veterinary I.C.U., more than a dozen blood transfusions and few solid answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Cats have been so understudied,” said Elinor Karlsson, a geneticist at UMass Chan Medical School and the Broad Institute. “They’re going to remain a black box unless something changes on the research side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-d45f77d"&gt;Dogs as the default&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Over the last few decades, veterinary medicine has made enormous strides, allowing pets like Olive to receive highly advanced care. But feline medicine has lagged behind its canine counterpart, and it is not always easy to provide evidence-based medicine for cats. “It’s still considered a bit of a niche interest,” said Dr. Karen Perry, a veterinary orthopedic surgeon with a focus on feline health at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 07:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5qX2NJb1pYNGZxNFBpUUNrdzl6YklQS0pxT2dyeGpURXdUZmI2dDhMdDRwWGh2Z3Y5bV9BT3RSb0Fjci02U3d2N0RXeW51bFNFTjhTMXBnR3Z2cFkweUNaOGQxSlBxWjcwRlh6WV9LcG40SGJpaklnNWlabUpHQQ</guid></item><item><title>I'm haunted by the texts my daughter sent before taking her own life - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNRVFELUZ6Z2YxaG1qZndEa2FiSktPMFE2ZmZFa1NDZmw2aUtac2dDT3dOeXV3S3FOM1ZabFpBdzMyRWl0cjNEbTY3VXBObnRBbkFKY1M3WDUwVTh6NVFsS1JaRnRXdVpuSXhhV0hYd3UyRW1FTmduWTlZMS1KWmJzUVpxVGE1ang0ajA3VXR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The phone call came early in the morning of January 9, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A voice at the end of the line got straight to the point: Honey Beuf's 19-year-old daughter Liv, a student in her first year at college in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-d5912a10-f392-11ef-a9f1-33173da01833"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, was in hospital. She had tried to take her own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I immediately grabbed my car keys and drove up to the ER,' remembers Honey, a mother-of-three, who was living in Boulder at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took 45 minutes to get there and every minute she prayed the outcome would be different from the deepest fears gripping her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly it was not to be. Liv died just a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For over two years after she died, I would wake up every morning and think, "Oh it's a new day",' says Honey. 'Then a second later, I'd realize my child was gone and I'd feel instantly devastated. It made me feel physically ill and shattered.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I miss her so much and the quiet in the house is still unsettling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An 'empathetic and warm' young woman, Liv was clearly close to her mother. So close that she had a honeybee tattoo on her wrist in her honor and was always telling her how much she loved her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Honey received a call early one January morning to say that her daughter Liv, 19, had been admitted to hospital after trying to take her own life. (Pictured: Honey with daughter Liv)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The night of her suicide bid, she wrote as much by text while her mother was sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If only I had been awake and seen the messages,' the 65-year-old retiree says now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though a heartbreaking process, Honey is determined to share her daughter's story in the hope it will help other young people and parents in the midst of what is fast becoming a nationwide youth mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in adolescents and young adults in the United States, with suicide deaths among 10 to 24-year-olds increasing by 62 percent from 2007 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside Liv's older sister Tess, 34, and a team of mental health professionals, Honey has set up &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thelivproject.org/"&gt;The Liv Project&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization in honor of the late teen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says she's thought of Liv's compassion towards other people every day since her daughter died. 'She had so much ahead of her,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Liv's last visit home from the University of Northern Colorado, she had been excited to tell her mother that she wanted to change her major. She'd been studying early childhood education but hoped to become a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She said: "It's because I want to help kids who have gone through what I've gone through",' Honey recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Liv never got to achieve those ambitions herself, Honey is determined to keep her daughter's dream alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What haunts me most is the thought of how much pain she must have been experiencing to do what she did that night,' she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liv's college friends said she had come back from a party, where she'd been drinking. It appears she took the steps to end her life on the spur of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While shocking, it wasn't the first time Liv had tried to commit suicide. She'd spent a lifetime struggling with mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Honey, pictured with baby Liv on the day of her baptism in 1999, remembers watching her daughter move around in the hospital crib as if she felt uncomfortable in her skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a little girl, Liv (above at the age of six) was troubled by everyday things such as the sound of people smacking their lips. She'd say: 'Mom, I feel physical pain when I hear noises like that.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Honey admits Liv had always been a different child from Tess and her older brother, now 34. The night Liv was born, Honey remembers watching her move around in the hospital crib as if the infant felt uncomfortable in her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a baby and toddler, she had a hard time sleeping and startled easily. Her wariness of strangers went beyond the common reticence of young children. Her mother would place her in the cart in the grocery store and other shoppers would come up to say how adorable she looked with her shock of red hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She would flinch because she didn't want any kind of interaction,' Honey says. 'I would have to scoop her up and hug her to try and make her calm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The little girl was troubled by everyday things such as the sound of people smacking their lips or eating. 'I'd say, "I know it bothers." And she'd say: "Mom, it's not that it bothers me. It hurts. I feel physical pain when I hear noises like that".'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aged four, around the time her parents divorced, Liv was diagnosed with a non-verbal language disability and sensory processing disorder. She was helped by a team of specialists including occupational therapists and mental health professionals. And she made great strides – particularly in speech – picking up coping skills when she felt uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 14, she started taking medication for anxiety and depression and had regular psychotherapy sessions up until she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Honey, the former co-owner of a staffing company, worked flexible hours and was glad she could step in when Liv was struggling in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In high school, she would call and say she was having a panic attack,' she says. 'I would calmly say: "I want you to take a break, go to your safe spot or safe person, and then go back to your classroom." If it was bad, I would go pick her up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, Honey says, the depressive episodes were sporadic. She had a piano in her room and her friends would come round for sing-alongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, there were many highs. Liv was never happier than when she was performing music, whether it was the piano or ukulele — which she taught herself to play by watching tutorials on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liv was never happier than when she was performing music, whether it was the piano or ukulele — which she taught herself to play by watching tutorials on YouTube&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Six years after the tragedy, Honey still asks herself whether there was anything more she could have done for Liv (pictured above aged 8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her friendships revolved around choirs and musical theater. Honey says her fellow performers were 'her people'. She wasn't anxious when she was singing or acting. 'All of that disappeared when she was on stage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would joke about being uncoordinated but auditioned for cheerleading as a lark - and couldn't believe it when she made the team. Outwardly she appeared to be a charismatic, friendly girl who put others first, but, behind the scenes, Liv struggled with dark, intrusive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had body dysmorphia and thought nobody could love her because she believed she was overweight. She'd binge and purge food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media made things worse. Like many teens in middle and high school, she compared herself to impossible images of perfection. She started cutting herself to procure an emotional release. Mercifully, she stopped after therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, horrifyingly, at the age of 15, she was sexually assaulted at a party hosted by older kids. The assault led to her first suicide attempt. She was found by her father, at whose Colorado home she was staying at the time, and was airlifted to the hospital where, thankfully, staff saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liv spent a month recovering in a mental health facility before returning to high school. She was mortified and scared at the thought that people knew what had happened but, 'she didn't want to fall behind her peers,' Honey recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her mother's suggestions that she take a gap year to ease the pressure of starting somewhere new, she began her first year in college in Greeley, Colorado, in the fall of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would occasionally return at weekends but loved her social life as a student. She drank alcohol and smoked weed. 'It wasn't a good combination, especially with her medication,' says Honey, who stressed the dangers to her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ironically, the weekend before she died, Liv told her mom that she didn't think cannabis was 'working' for her. 'I'm going to stop smoking,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six years after the tragedy, Honey still asks herself whether there was anything more she could have done for Liv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are things I wish I had known while raising a child,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She calls out social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram for damaging a young person's self-esteem and believes parents should delay getting kids a smartphone for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consider a flip phone until they reach 18 so they can't be exposed to social media for hours on end,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she's keen to stress that parents should be listeners first, rather than fixers. Honey says that when Liv was struggling, as her mother she would immediately go into problem-solving mode. She'd try and arrange more therapy sessions or have her psychiatrist change her medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But more than seeing their parents try to solve things, kids need to know they're validating their feelings,' Honey says, adding, 'They want a safe space where people aren't saying, "What are you talking about? Life's great!"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Honey admits: 'Liv didn't openly confide in me about her suicidal thoughts, because she knew how scared I would be.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for red flags, they include emotional volatility, changes in behavior and lack of interest in what once gave them joy.

			&lt;p&gt;As Shakespeare put it, we all have our entrances and our exits on this grand stage we call life, and now researchers have identified the specific point in middle-age when our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neurons-in-the-brain-appear-to-follow-a-distinct-mathematical-pattern"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; show the first signs of starting down a downward slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That age, based on brain scans and tests covering 19,300 individuals, is on average around 44 years. It's here that degeneration starts to be noticeable, before hitting its most rapid rate at age 67. By the time we reach 90, the speed of brain aging levels off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the team behind the new study, led by researchers from Stony Brook University in the US, the findings could be helpful in figuring out ways to promote better &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; during the later stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154414" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuronStress.jpg" alt="Neuron stress" class="wp-image-154414 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuronStress.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuronStress-521x415.jpg 521w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuronStress-600x478.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154414" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at the reaction of neurons to stress. (Antal et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding exactly when and how brain aging accelerates gives us strategic timepoints for intervention," &lt;a href="https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/research-reveals-critical-midlife-window-for-preventing-age-related-brain-decline/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stony Brook University neuroscientist Lilianne Mujica-Parodi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've identified a critical mid-life window where the brain begins to experience declining access to energy but before irreversible damage occurs, essentially the 'bend' before the 'break'."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was also able to identify a potential main driver of this decay: neuronal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;. The results suggest that as our brains age, insulin has a reduced effect on neurons, meaning less glucose is taken up as energy – which then starts to break brain signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea that metabolism affects brain aging was supported by a genetic analysis conducted by the researchers. Activity related to the glucose-absorbing protein GLUT4 and the fat-transporting protein APOE matched signs of brain wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows that somehow replacing or repairing energy sources for neurons could help slow down brain aging – and potentially give us another treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases (APOE has also been strongly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;associated with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"During mid-life, neurons are metabolically stressed due to insufficient fuel; they're struggling, but they're still viable," &lt;a href="https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/research-reveals-critical-midlife-window-for-preventing-age-related-brain-decline/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mujica-Parodi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therefore, providing an alternative fuel during this critical window can help restore function. However, by later ages, neurons' prolonged starvation may have triggered a cascade of other physiological effects that make intervention less effective."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the hypothesis with a group of 101 individuals who were given &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone"&gt;ketone supplements&lt;/a&gt;, which seem to promote insulin sensitivity in brain cells and suppress metabolic damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain degradation stabilized after the ketone supplements were taken, with the biggest benefits appearing for those in middle-age (40 to 59 in this case). That suggests a treatment of this type could work, but timing will be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention," &lt;a href="https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/research-reveals-critical-midlife-window-for-preventing-age-related-brain-decline/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Botond Antal, from Stony Brook University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Rather than waiting for cognitive symptoms, which may not appear until substantial damage has occurred, we can potentially identify people at risk through neurometabolic markers and intervene during this critical window."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2416433122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A thorough study of 429,691 surgeries in Canada has revealed a worrying statistic: you're around 5 percent more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/long-waits-in-the-emergency-room-are-risking-patient-lives"&gt;likely to die&lt;/a&gt;, experience complications, or need to go back to the hospital if you have your operation just before the weekend, rather than just after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by a team from institutions across the US and Canada, suggests Friday fatigue affects medical professionals as much as the rest of us. However, there are likely to be multiple factors involved in causing the discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the researchers didn't dig too deeply into the reasons behind these statistics, they do have some ideas about what's happening – and they're calling for more work to be done to make sure &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-where-most-hospital-infections-actually-come-from"&gt;standards of care&lt;/a&gt; are kept constant across the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154419" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154419" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MonthlyCalendar.jpg" alt="Monthly calendar" class="wp-image-154419 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MonthlyCalendar.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MonthlyCalendar-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154419" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Day of the week matters for surgery outcomes. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-planner-with-two-pens-sitting-on-top-of-it-cdDDWLezAJ0"&gt;2H Media/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that patients treated before the weekend are at increased risk of complications, emphasizing the need for further investigation into processes of surgical care to ensure consistent high-quality care and patient outcomes," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery data was collected over 12 years, and the researchers compiled statistics for outcomes at 30 days, 90 days, and a year after surgery. The benefits of having surgery after the weekend persisted across all these time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the difference between pre-weekend and post-weekend surgeries was less pronounced if it was an emergency procedure. The researchers think this might be because emergency surgeries are less likely to be put off until the next week – meaning the conditions of patients have less opportunity to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is going to be needed to figure out exactly what's going on here, but given that &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/fulltext/2018/02000/weekend_surgical_care_and_postoperative_mortality_.3.aspx"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have found similar patterns, the underlying causes are most probably many and varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"System-level factors, such as staffing differences, service availability, and obstacles with care coordination, likely play a contributing role," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One data point the researchers did refer to was that the surgeons on duty tended to have around three years less experience overall on Friday compared to Monday. This could be a starting point for hospitals looking to provide care that's more consistent over the whole week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the only factor that may influence your chance of a successful surgery either. Earlier research has suggested that the risk of death for female patients &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/female-patients-are-much-likelier-to-suffer-complications-and-death-at-the-hands-of-male-surgeons"&gt;is significantly higher&lt;/a&gt; if the surgeon is male – though the reasons why aren't clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, surgeons and other health professionals are all committed to doing the best possible job they possibly can for their patients, and identifying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-confirm-the-worst-day-of-the-week-for-severe-heart-attacks"&gt;patterns like this&lt;/a&gt; are helpful in making sure that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further study is needed to understand differences in care that may underpin these observations and ensure that patients receive high-quality care regardless of the day of the week," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830842"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They had both consumed either raw meat or unpasteurized milk, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Courtney White, vice president of veterinary medicine at the Humane Society of Huron Valley in Ann Arbor, said risk to humans and widespread exposure to community and domestic cats is considered low, but owners and caregivers at shelters should be aware of the risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Are they going outside? Do you have a backyard flock? Do you live near a poultry farm or a dairy farm? … Were there a lot of wild birds found dead within the area where you live?" White said in a press release Monday by the Michigan Pet Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Owners and caregivers of outdoor cats may choose to remove bird feeders and bird baths from their yard to limit possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Signs of infection in cats can included decreased energy and appetite progressing to neurologic signs like lack of coordination, inability to stand, tremors and seizures. Respiratory signs like nasal discharge, coughing or sneezing may or may not be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If a pet owner suspects their cat may be infected, they should isolate the animal from other pets, if possible, and call a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"With cats, their incubation period is very short," White said. "They might start showing signs within one to two days after exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;H5N1, which was first detected in 1996 in China and was found in the United States in 2022, has affected 160 million poultry across the nation. In Michigan, it's also been found in red foxes, possums, racoons, coyotes, dairy cattle and two humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Any mammal is potentially susceptible to the bird flu just by the nature of how influenza virus continues to mutate and change," White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The virus can be transmitted through contact with infected animals from their saliva, feces or urine, in addition to raw meat or unpasteurized milk derived from the infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Birds remain the most vulnerable population, White said. HPAI can be spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected animals, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For steps to prevent the spread of bird flu and information about how to report suspected cases, visit &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/animals/diseases/avian/avian-influenza" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/animals/diseases/avian/avian-influenza" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;MDARD's avian influenza webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The United States has spent billions on battling the bird flu.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered a naturally-occurring molecule that &lt;span&gt;aids&lt;/span&gt; appetite control and weight loss so well, it may compete with popular GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called BRP (BRINP2-related peptide), and works &lt;span&gt;by activating particular neurons in the brain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in a similar way to GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonists. The difference between the two peptides is the metabolic route each takes to get there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathology researcher Laetitia Coassolo from Stanford University led a team to design an AI-based drug discovery program called 'Peptide Predictor', which they used to identify 373 proteins for further investigation among thousands of possibilities. From this haystack they screened 100 peptides that might induce the kind of brain activity needed to meddle with appetite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these was the tiny BRP molecule, made up of just 12 amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154399" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite.jpeg" alt="a 3d model of the BRP molecule on a black background. it has a helix-like structure in the center, from which various spheres and sticks representing atoms and bonds protrude. the molecule is coloured in a rainbow gradient." class="wp-image-154399 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite.jpeg 1614w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite-642x889.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite-300x415.jpeg 300w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite-768x1064.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite-1109x1536.jpeg 1109w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite-1478x2048.jpeg 1478w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/svensson-appetite-600x831.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1614px) 100vw, 1614px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154399" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The 12-amino-acid BRP peptide (spheres are atoms and sticks are bonds) suppresses appetite and reduces weight gain in mice and pigs without causing nausea or food aversion. (&lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html"&gt;Katrin Svensson/Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the GLP-1 peptide increased markers of activity in human insulin cells by a factor of three, while a growth factor increased similar activity by a factor of 10 in brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, BRP raised markers of activity in both neuronal and insulin-producing cells more than tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73085" data-postid="154360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Animal testing&lt;/a&gt; in lean, male mice revealed that injecting BRP could halve the amount of food they ate in the hour that followed. It had the same effect on minipigs, whose metabolisms and eating behaviors are more similar to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When obese mice were given these BRP injections across 14 days, they lost an average of 4 grams compared to controls. And almost all of that weight loss was from body fat, not muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide treatments can trigger not only loss of fat, but of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-can-trigger-bone-and-muscle-loss-expert-warns"&gt;muscle and bone&lt;/a&gt;, which may account for as much as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.14725"&gt;20 percent of the weight lost&lt;/a&gt;. This has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-like-ozempic-may-have-a-shrinking-effect-on-the-heart"&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; about the long-term impacts of taking drugs like Ozempic for weight loss, which will only come to light in time. Further research is needed to determine whether, for instance, heart health may suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 agonists can also come with other unpleasant side effects, like &lt;span&gt;nausea and constipation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, a&lt;/span&gt;nimal testing of BRP showed no sign of these side-effects, or muscle loss, perhaps because the molecule activates different brain receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas, and other tissues," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stanford pathology researcher &lt;/span&gt;Katrin Svensson&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"That's why Ozempic has widespread effects including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRP, on the other hand, appears to work in the hypothalamus, the brain's appetite and metabolism center, activating entirely different metabolic and neuronal pathways to semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it will make it to market will depend on how the molecule performs in the human body, which Svensson's company will soon investigate in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="154360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of money to be made in developing drugs to treat obesity, and the market is only expected to increase: scientists predict &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-predict-80-of-american-adults-will-be-overweight-or-obese-by-2050"&gt;four in every five Americans&lt;/a&gt; will be obese or overweight by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it proves safe and effective, BRP will be stepping into an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/imitation-ozempic-is-flooding-the-market-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;increasingly crowded ring&lt;/a&gt; of peptide-based weight loss drugs, alongside &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/game-changer-treatment-is-first-new-weight-loss-drug-approved-by-the-fda-in-years"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/unique-new-drug-is-more-effective-than-ozempic-for-weight-loss"&gt;Tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The lack of effective drugs to treat obesity in humans has been a problem for decades," Svensson &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Nothing we've tested before has compared to semaglutide's ability to decrease appetite and body weight. We are very eager to learn if [BRP] is safe and effective in humans."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08683-y"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A receptor that cannabis latches onto in the brain could be a promising target for future mental health treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiencing chronic stress is &lt;a href="https://www.jscimedcentral.com/public/assets/articles/psychiatry-5-1091.pdf"&gt;known to&lt;/a&gt; leave people vulnerable to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153878" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; or anxiety, and a new study on mice suggests &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor"&gt;cannabinoid receptors&lt;/a&gt; might be the reason some of us show more resilience in the face of overwhelming pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers at the University of Laval in Canada, the study found that mice with increased levels of cannabinoid receptor 1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_1"&gt;CB1&lt;/a&gt;) on certain brain cells show significantly fewer behaviors associated with anxiety or depression, even when they are subject to chronic social stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results have neuroscientists hypothesizing that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_1"&gt;CB1&lt;/a&gt;, the most common cannabinoid receptor in the brain&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, may have a protective role to play against two of the most common mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CB1 can be activated by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system"&gt;natural neurotransmitters in the body&lt;/a&gt; or by cannabis, and among many other crucial bodily functions, it plays a fundamental role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-important-reason-disturbed-sleep-makes-everything-hurt-more"&gt;stress responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings don't necessarily imply that cannabis as a drug can protect the brain from chronic stress, but researchers say it does suggest the possibility of trying similar yet more targeted molecules in future drug trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The challenge, however, is to limit their effects to astrocytes, because strong and prolonged activation of the same receptors in neurons can have side effects, notably on alertness, anxiety and appetite," &lt;a href="https://pressroom.ulaval.ca/2025/02/27/scientists-discover-key-protein-in-resilience-to-stress-4c4d6aa5-3e31-4200-b498-621cc902a6d7"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Caroline Ménard, who heads the lab at Laval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of CB1 receptors in the brain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10751057/"&gt;act on neurons&lt;/a&gt;, but some of these triggers are also found on non-neuronal cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"&gt;astrocytes&lt;/a&gt;. Astrocytes are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545142/"&gt;the most common cell&lt;/a&gt; in the central nervous system, and recently, they have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1376-23.2023"&gt;emerged as key regulators&lt;/a&gt; of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'feet' of these star-shaped cells press up against blood vessels in the brain, creating a protective barrier through which only certain molecules can flow. According to the new experiments on mice, CB1 receptors play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyre-on-the-verge-of-breaching-the-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153880" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-642x472.jpg" alt="Astrocytes Blood Brain" class="size-medium wp-image-153880" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-642x472.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-564x415.jpg 564w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-768x565.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-1536x1129.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-2048x1506.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fig1-600x441.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153880" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How astrocyte feet help create a blood-brain barrier. (Burn et al., &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/FBL/26/9/10.52586/4969/htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Front. Biosci.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2021)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27604-x"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0010-3"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that chronic stress in mice damages the blood-brain barrier, increasing inflammation in the brain and leading to the animals acting in depressed ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the blood-brain barrier is kept intact, however, the depressive-like behaviors, including social avoidance, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia"&gt;anhedonia&lt;/a&gt;, and anxiety, are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We noticed that mice resilient to stress had more CB1 receptors in the barrier than mice with depressive-like behavior or mice not exposed to stress," &lt;a href="https://pressroom.ulaval.ca/2025/02/27/scientists-discover-key-protein-in-resilience-to-stress-4c4d6aa5-3e31-4200-b498-621cc902a6d7"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;  Ménard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That gave us the idea to investigate the role of astrocytic CB1 receptors in the response to chronic stress."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ménard and her colleagues induced some mice brains to over-express CB1 receptors on certain astrocytes. By doing so, the researchers showed they could reduce inflammation in the brain, maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, and hold off symptoms of anxiety and depression, even when they were socially harassed by aggressive mice for days on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity had a remarkably similar effect to the over-expression of CB1 receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that were genetically altered to be &lt;em&gt;missing&lt;/em&gt; the genes for this receptor, however, were highly sensitive to stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers only altered CB1 expression in two brain regions where the blood-brain barrier seems most vulnerable to stress: the nucleus accumbens – associated with reward and mood regulation – and the prefrontal cortex – associated with social behaviors, decision-making, and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153889" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/1-s2.0-S0028390821002331-ga1_lrg-642x402.jpg" alt="Astrocyte Receptors " class="size-medium wp-image-153889" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/1-s2.0-S0028390821002331-ga1_lrg-642x402.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/1-s2.0-S0028390821002331-ga1_lrg-663x415.jpg 663w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/1-s2.0-S0028390821002331-ga1_lrg-768x481.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/1-s2.0-S0028390821002331-ga1_lrg-600x375.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/1-s2.0-S0028390821002331-ga1_lrg.jpg 1416w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153889" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;br&gt;CB1 receptors are present in astrocytes at different levels, and activation can release gliotransmitters to regulate synaptic plasticity. (Covelo et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108678"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2021)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon examining postmortem human brains, Ménard &lt;a href="https://pressroom.ulaval.ca/2025/02/27/scientists-discover-key-protein-in-resilience-to-stress-4c4d6aa5-3e31-4200-b498-621cc902a6d7"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; she and her team, including lead author Katarzyna Dudek, found the level of CB1 receptors on astrocytes in these parts of the brain was "lower in people with major depression at the time of death than in people without depression or those treated with antidepressants."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This validates the animal models, but more research is needed for a broader picture. The authors only measured one marker of inflammation in the brain, which does not fully reflect the complexity of the endocannabinoid system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Until we find a molecule that acts specifically on CB1 receptors in astrocytes, we can mitigate the negative repercussions of stress by taking advantage of the protective effect of physical activity," &lt;a href="https://pressroom.ulaval.ca/2025/02/27/scientists-discover-key-protein-in-resilience-to-stress-4c4d6aa5-3e31-4200-b498-621cc902a6d7"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ménard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01891-9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

On last Friday’s edition of the Children’s Health Defense internet morning show, the group’s chief scientific officer, Brian Hooker, repeated false claims that have been spreading on social media that the child had actually been sick with RSV and pneumonia, and denied proper treatment in the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really nefarious,” Hooker said. “It feels like Covid all over again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Edwards hosted Hooker on his podcast in February, about a month into the Texas outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Offering nontraditional therapies to individuals who look for something other than science-based or evidence-based medicine makes it really hard to convince that group that my science is better than his science,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A turn away from conventional medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Edwards was conventionally trained at the University of Texas-Houston Medical School and initially opened a small town clinic where he &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905235520/http:/www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/ben-edwards-small-town-family-doctor/" target="_blank"&gt;practiced family medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In recent years, however, he’s made a switch to practicing outside of conventional medicine, operating as a so-called integrative practitioner or functional medicine doctor and promoting something he&lt;a href="https://triallawyerscollege.libsyn.com/dr-ben-edwards-on-the-crossroads-of-medicine-and-the-law-0" target="_blank"&gt; called&lt;/a&gt; the “Four Pillars of Health” as the key to health: nutrition, hydration, movement and peace. Through&lt;a href="https://veritaswellnessmember.com/" target="_blank"&gt; his website&lt;/a&gt;, Edwards sells dietary supplements, blood tests, and $35-a-month membership plans for access to his online education materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Edwards told NBC News that he’s volunteering his time in the measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250310-doctor-Ben-Edwards-ew-410p-0703ce.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250310-doctor-Ben-Edwards-ew-410p-0703ce.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250310-doctor-Ben-Edwards-ew-410p-0703ce.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250310-doctor-Ben-Edwards-ew-410p-0703ce.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250310-doctor-Ben-Edwards-ew-410p-0703ce.jpg" alt="Doctor Ben Edwards, of Post, Texas, on Oct. 21, 2009."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Dr. Ben Edwards in 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;The Washington Post via Getty Images file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During Covid, Edwards&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/05/17/texas-bob-hall-covid-19-vaccine/" target="_blank"&gt; appeared as an expert&lt;/a&gt; at Texas state legislative hearings,&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=132545655574449" target="_blank"&gt; where he shared&lt;/a&gt; dubious claims about widespread injuries and deaths he said were caused by the vaccines. In 2020, Edwards&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=711805449718300" target="_blank"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; that masks were ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On recent podcast episodes, Edwards said that after practicing for several years, he came to believe that vaccines and modern medicine were not responsible for historical declines in infectious disease deaths. Instead, he credited sanitation, nutrition and other lifestyle factors — factors that were instrumental in decreasing mortality, but do not account for how vaccines have reduced or eliminated infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On his podcast, he’s hosted anti-vaccine influencers and activists, including&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9xkKr-yknE&amp;amp;ab_channel=Dr.BenEdwards" target="_blank"&gt; Barbara Loe Fisher&lt;/a&gt; of the National Vaccine Information Center and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrFm9vtNcYQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=Dr.BenEdwards" target="_blank"&gt;Hooker&lt;/a&gt; of Children’s Health Defense;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrFm9vtNcYQ&amp;amp;t=861s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Dr.BenEdwards" target="_blank"&gt; defended&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Wakefield, the discredited doctor behind the retracted study that falsely linked autism to the MMR vaccine; and&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrFm9vtNcYQ&amp;amp;t=861s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Dr.BenEdwards" target="_blank"&gt; recommended&lt;/a&gt; books from anti-vaccine activist J.B.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Before this year, Suffolk County had not reported a rabid raccoon since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 Long Island</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 23:01:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNaFBBcWJrakU3S25ySzhrU1ZVX2RZOGJPaDFNMVBWbDZTeHF5dGhvRklCV3d1WUZlZ2dJRUJmN0JaeU14b1NWQlNPakVscUFJVTZuZkVGWEM3ZHkzaDdZcExzZkl3MnhlS2VHcjVIcDVZODdYR0p2X01jTXBoZzIzTkhfWGZWRHFSa1FabXI0WUxRN1BwdHBtc2tqUnA4bnlDWXc</guid></item><item><title>Cardiologists seeing more cases of POTS since the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic - WZZM13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxQNHFDYmhlaGR6c3FwRlJWdUxsN0NNUWxwUDZxNmU0blFnZ010Qzg1NE5jeEVFMC11REtwbHMyWFlFWlVGVlpHYmNmSXV4TlJKek5qR2NWdzFiTTluWmhIU2RMNkpiemRfOUtsRldSbTdxb2d6QWJxOWFXbk9RRWZKZzczcndNV0Q0Tk04QlVQVFRkVnhVMEFZLXJtNGJ3aE95bXFqRjc2ODRmV0lTcVFOc2hKRXp1ZDdvdE0zTndrY0Q2akJSNVdRTUdSZnN1aE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;POTS is a condition that disrupts the body's ability to regulate blood flow while changing positions. Dr. Charles Hong says they have seen a sharp rise since COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENT COUNTY, Mich. — This week marks five years since the COVID-19 Pandemic began disrupting lives and shuttering communities across Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many since then who caught a bout of the virus, their illness only lasted a few days. However, Cardiologist Charles Hong at Michigan State University says he has seen many patients experiencing a cardiovascular syndrome after coming down with a case of COVID.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From the cardiologist perspective, the most common sequela of what you call &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25111-long-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Post COVID Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; might be what we call POTS," said Hong. "&lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the syndrome is characterized by a sudden increase in heart rate after standing up since the condition impacts the body's ability to regulate blood flow when changing positions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong said the condition can be debilitating, with symptoms like dizziness, fainting, brain fog, shortness of breath and even gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since the pandemic, Hong said his work has been a lot busier.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Before COVID, I probably saw a few people on maybe a month basis, not more than 20 a year," said Hong. "I'm [now] seeing that almost on a daily basis, so the incidents have gone up tremendously, and that's part of the reason why people believe that this is a part of a post COVID syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong added that POTS was mainly seen among younger women. However, since the pandemic, he is seeing largely both young men and young women with POTS following relatively minor cases of COVID. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"COVID is associated with a whole host of autonomic disorders, dysfunctions, and maybe it's unmasking what normally used to be a tolerable condition into something that is noticeable and sometimes debilitating," said Hong.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the medical community is still trying to learn why patients are developing these conditions following COVID. He reminded that the COVID-19 pandemic began just five years ago, and research takes time.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a precedence for this. Classic example will be Lyme disease, right? Lyme disease, you have an acute Lyme disease, but then you have these post sequela of chronic, sort of a debilitating disease that you suffer," said Hong. "We don't know that much about Post COVID Syndrome. People are still trying to figure out what that is."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For patients experiencing POTS after COVID, Dr. Hong said their symptoms largely go away after a few weeks to months, but certain symptoms, such as brain fog, can sometimes last up to a year or longer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment can include certain lifestyle adjustments, physical therapy and medications if symptoms persist.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong encourages people who feel they are experiencing a new condition after being sick with COVID to see a medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's always good to seek medical help, because there's a name for it, and there's likely something you can do about it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Health officials in the D.C. region say this year’s flu season — with the deaths of six children reported in Maryland and Virginia — has been especially severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had higher peaks of influenza over the last few weeks than we’ve had in a decade,” Sean O’Donnell, deputy chief for public health with the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, told WTOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, there were more than 1,000 hospitalizations in Maryland, O’Donnell said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In previous years, the highest number we’ve gotten in a weekly total has been under 600,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, O’Donnell said, the latest data available was more positive: “We’re already seeing those numbers start to come down, fortunately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Donnell said the spike in reported cases and fatalities came relatively late in the flu season — but he pointed out flu season can last past May and into June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, he said, “it really came on at a later point and a higher peak than what we’ve seen in past years”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Prince George’s County Schools Superintendent Millard House II reported &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/prince-georges-county/2025/03/at-least-2-prince-georges-co-elementary-students-die-from-the-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two students had died of flu-related illnesses.&lt;/a&gt; The state’s most recent data from the Department of Health reported a single pediatric fatality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Virginia, there have been four pediatric deaths related to the flu. Data on the Virginia Department of Health’s website shows two of those deaths occurred in what the department lists as the “Eastern Health Region,” and one each occurred in the “Central” and “Northern” regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northern Virginia Health region includes Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Loudon and Prince William counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed 114 pediatric deaths tied to the flu.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the new secretary of NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services,&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/" target="_blank"&gt; has disparaged vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for years. He gained national notoriety over the past two decades by promoting misinformation about vaccines and a conjectured link to autism, drawing widespread condemnation from the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORW4GYSEWBFKTDXNIURHC4JLRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is unclear if Kennedy had a role, directly or indirectly, in the move to cancel these grants. But his ascendancy to HHS leadership has caused a stir in the research community. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another part of HHS, was asked by the Trump administration to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/07/vaccines-trump-autism-reseasrch/"&gt;launch a study into a possible connection between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;, despite repeated research that shows no link between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VDVK3LJIHVGFTDZXCTBRYLFBWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Spokespeople at NIH and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBN2ZUJVO5EPBB6IKTJOCFVFBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Monday’s email was sent by Michelle Bulls, director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration.

Scientists found mid-pregnancy stress has a stronger impact on girls’ stress reactivity, while boys are more sensitive to stress experienced in late gestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved analyzing infants’ hormonal responses to mild stress and temperament after prenatal stress exposure, correcting previous beliefs that girls were generally more sensitive. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the timing of prenatal stress exposure to understand and possibly mitigate long-term mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Mid and late pregnancy are critical periods when prenatal stress differently influences boys and girls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys showed greater sensitivity to stress later in pregnancy, correcting the misconception that prenatal stress primarily affects girls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infant Stress Indicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers measured infants’ stress responses via cortisol levels after mild lab-induced stress and observed differences based on prenatal stress timing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A team of researchers at Michigan State University and the University of Michigan found new insights on the timing of prenatal stress and its effect on infant stress reactivity and temperament — including differences between genders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology,&lt;/em&gt; is the first to examine weekly stress across 27 weeks of pregnancy to pinpoint when it most affects a newborn’s stress response and temperament — two measures that indicate infant biobehavioral reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prenatal stress has a well-established link to negative health, including mental health, outcomes in children and adults, but most studies conclude that the biggest effects are on girls. Our study found that not to be the case. It’s in fact, just different timing,” said Alytia Levendosky, lead investigator of the study and professor in MSU’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 396 pregnant women, specifically from a high stress-risk population due to low income and/or exposure to intimate partner violence. Weekly stress assessments were conducted via email or text from week 15 through week 41 of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At six months postpartum, infant cortisol levels were collected before and after a mildly stressful laboratory task to see how their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, or HPA axis, responded to stress. Mothers also reported on infant temperament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found periods of higher sensitivity to stress in both mid and late gestation but found that girls and boys had differing patterns of sensitivity. The data showed that experiencing stress in mid-gestation affected girls’ HPA axis and temperament, while late gestation stress impacted boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies in this field stopped their last stress assessment between 32-34 weeks. Because this study ran through week 41, Levendosky and her team were able to locate the time that was most sensitive for boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is an essential step in correcting our understanding around prenatal stress effects for boys and girls,” said Joseph Lonstein, investigator on the study and professor in MSU’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that our findings inspire additional research so we can better understand what is happening in fetal brain development across pregnancy and how it is affected by stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current funding allows the team of researchers to continue following these participants until the age of four — with assessments at 2.5 years old and again at 4 years old. Amy Nuttall, co-author of this study and associate professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at MSU, hopes to continue the study through even later childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this stress and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9af2fbe8e8abafacafdaf7e9efb4fffeef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jack Harrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://msu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jack Harrison – Michigan State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2025.107368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pinpointing the timing of prenatal stress associated with infant biobehavioral reactivity&lt;/a&gt;” by Alytia Levendosky et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinpointing the timing of prenatal stress associated with infant biobehavioral reactivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenatal stress has a well-established link to negative biobehavioral outcomes in young children, particularly for girls, but the specific timing during gestation of these associations remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, we examined differential effects of timing of prenatal stress on two infant biobehavioral outcomes [i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity and difficult temperament] that are early-life precursors to the development of psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained the most granular assessment of prenatal stress to date involving weekly stress ratings from 396 pregnant women between 15 and 41 weeks gestation. At 6 months postpartum, infant salivary cortisol was collected (n = 173) before and after a stressful laboratory task and mothers reported on infant temperament (n = 244).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning explored both between- and within-person regression effects of prenatal stress on the two infant biobehavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For HPA axis reactivity, we found a sensitive period during mid-gestation (weeks 20 and 29) for girls, but during late gestation (week 37) for boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For difficult temperament, we found a between-persons effect of mean stress level as well as sensitive periods in mid (weeks 20, 21, 25) and late gestation (week 37) for girls, but across mid to late gestation (weeks 25, 27, 30, 34, 40) for boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to use a weekly assessment across gestation to demonstrate specific windows of sensitivity for infant biobehavioral precursors of child psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight that biological sex critically influences specific timing of these prenatal stress associations with infant outcomes, thus informing our understanding of sex differences in early biobehavioral markers of psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 22:08:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9wMGd5bTNtYUdxblJ4dTlDR280MFh3NkM3R09pUXFhODhSQWVoUlV1UUhsOXh6Mk9rS2dRVEhySUJkdV82TmdrLUg3eDZ1QjhFRFZSMFVtZXVVSFZhMUxLYzV4dTRkVTBXemN3REc1aXpCbmJHZFg0</guid></item><item><title>“Where’s My Lorazepam?!” All About the Most In-Demand Drug at ‘The White Lotus’ - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBCdzJTMzNjSnpQZ0J0Mkp1Z2t5TWJkZE5NNzBmODFwZ1RDaWJQTjItRldFWTBHT1lGVkl6YzFoUGVFSmhQNGdhTWlIMzhFR3VqVXMzb3MxdDFDZVZQWGZvc01hUlpyek9UVElVRlFCNGVVbjhLdmVj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Wondering About Lorazepam Post–‘White Lotus’?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you’ve been glued to your couch every Sunday night to catch the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/g63818954/the-white-lotus-season-3-cast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The White Lotus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, then you’ve surely been hearing the word “lorazepam” in Parker Posey’s drawling accent over and over in your head. It’s the drug of choice for kooky Southern mom Victoria Ratliff (played by Posey), who can’t seem to go anywhere—not even dinner with her family at a wellness retreat—without popping one of the anti-anxiety pills and stashing the prescription in her purse. She’s often seen zoning out, slurring her words, and even falling asleep at the table after sipping white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a63799719/the-white-lotus-season-3-release-schedule/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lastest episode;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lastest episode&lt;/a&gt; of the hit HBO series (season 3, episode 4, which dropped on March 9), it’s clear that Victoria’s husband, troubled businessman Timothy Ratliff (played by &lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a64126863/the-white-lotus-nude-scene-jason-isaacs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Isaacs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Isaacs&lt;/a&gt;), has also become dependent on her stash of lorazepam. He even goes so far as to steal the bottle from her bag while attending a yacht party with their three kids before downing a few glasses of what appears to be whiskey and becoming downright delirious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious what this drug is all about and if it’s even safe to take for anxiety, you’re not alone. That’s why I talked to an expert to get the lowdown on lorazepam. Scroll down for everything you might want to know about the medication and how it might be affecting the Ratliffs as they imbibe their way across Koh Samui. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam, also known by the brand name Ativan, is a drug commonly prescribed short-term to treat anxiety and panic disorders. It belongs to the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which work to calm the central nervous system by slowing activity in the brain. Designed to be used as an as-needed treatment to help you relax, it can also cause a sense of euphoria, drowsiness, and/or cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its accessibility and effectiveness in acute settings makes it a go-to for health care providers looking to alleviate immediate distress,” says &lt;a href="https://www.doctorsuevarma.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sue Varma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sue Varma&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PC, DFAPA. “It is most commonly used for short-term treatment, often while the patient works on long-term strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or lifestyle changes that address the root causes of anxiety or insomnia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Tomas Nevesely - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it an easy drug to abuse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone reaaally should have fact-checked Victoria when she handed a lorazepam to her husband and said, “Take this, they’re not addicting, I just take one when I need it.” Lorazepam is, in fact, very easy to abuse, says Dr. Varma, especially when it’s taken more frequently—or in larger doses—than prescribed. “Chronic misuse of lorazepam can lead to physical dependence, tolerance (requiring more of the drug for the same effect), and withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing use,” she says. “It’s so important that health care providers closely monitor patients on this medication, but that doesn’t always happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re being given a start date for lorazepam, your doctor should be giving you an end date, too, says Dr. Varma, noting that there should always be a clear plan for how you’ll get off the medication. It’s not the type of medication that you pop whenever you feel like it, despite what the Ratliffs might be doing on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, you shouldn’t even be using it daily: “Taking lorazepam alone two to three times a week or more is not the standard of care for somebody with an anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder,” says Dr. Varma. “Not only will it be insufficient, but a person will tend to take it daily, and soon find themselves developing tolerance and a physiological dependence on it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is it best for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorazepam is best as a short-term solution for those dealing with acute anxiety or panic disorders, says Dr. Varma. It can also be prescribed for those who need short-term relief from insomnia or stress, or patients who require a sedative for certain medical procedures (for example, if you have claustrophobia and need an MRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you drink while taking lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nooooo, Ratliff family, no! It is not safe to drink while on this medication! “Both lorazepam and alcohol are central nervous system depressants, meaning they slow down brain activity and can lead to profound sedation, impaired coordination, and respiratory depression,” says Dr. Varma. “This combination can increase the risk of severe side effects such as extreme drowsiness, dizziness, fainting, and even respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.” Put down the vino, Victoria!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few groups of people who should avoid lorazepam, says Dr. Varma, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, elderly patients who may be more sensitive to sedation, and individuals with certain medical conditions that may react to the medication (like severe liver disease and acute narrow-angle glaucoma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a history of substance abuse should also steer clear, says Dr. Varma. “Due to its potential for addiction, individuals who have struggled with alcohol, prescription drugs, or other substances should generally avoid lorazepam.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; in the Ratliff family taking it the right way?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly...no. As Dr. Varma mentioned, you should really only take lorazepam when you’re experiencing extreme anxiety—think, like, mid-panic attack—and very sparingly, at that. Victoria seems to be popping ’em whenever she feels any emotion at all, several times a day, and her dependence on the drug began showing all the way back in episode 1. (One of my favorite lines this entire season: Piper, Victoria’s daughter, quipping, “You don’t have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria also offered up her pills to her husband, which is always a major no-no.

It’s the drug of choice for kooky Southern mom Victoria Ratliff (played by Posey), who can’t seem to go anywhere—not even dinner with her family at a wellness retreat—without popping one of the anti-anxiety pills and stashing the prescription in her purse. She’s often seen zoning out, slurring her words, and even falling asleep at the table after sipping white wine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;On the &lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a63799719/the-white-lotus-season-3-release-schedule/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a63799719/the-white-lotus-season-3-release-schedule/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lastest episode" class="body-link css-egnagj emevuu60"&gt;lastest episode&lt;/a&gt; of the hit HBO series (season 3, episode 4, which dropped on March 9), it’s clear that Victoria’s husband, troubled businessman Timothy Ratliff (played by &lt;a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a64126863/the-white-lotus-nude-scene-jason-isaacs/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a64126863/the-white-lotus-nude-scene-jason-isaacs/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jason Isaacs" class="body-link css-egnagj emevuu60"&gt;Jason Isaacs&lt;/a&gt;), has also become dependent on her stash of lorazepam.

Scroll down for everything you might want to know about the medication and how it might be affecting the Ratliffs as they imbibe their way across Koh Samui. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-lorazepam" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1f1zqqc emevuu60"&gt;What is lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Lorazepam, also known by the brand name Ativan, is a drug commonly prescribed short-term to treat anxiety and panic disorders. It belongs to the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which work to calm the central nervous system by slowing activity in the brain. Designed to be used as an as-needed treatment to help you relax, it can also cause a sense of euphoria, drowsiness, and/or cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Its accessibility and effectiveness in acute settings makes it a go-to for health care providers looking to alleviate immediate distress,” says &lt;a href="https://www.doctorsuevarma.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.doctorsuevarma.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sue Varma" class="body-link css-egnagj emevuu60"&gt;Sue Varma&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PC, DFAPA. “It is most commonly used for short-term treatment, often while the patient works on long-term strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or lifestyle changes that address the root causes of anxiety or insomnia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="8" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="prescription bottle with backlit lorezapam tablets. lorezapam is a generic prescription anti anxiety medication." title="Prescription bottle with backlit Lorezapam tablets.

It’s not the type of medication that you pop whenever you feel like it, despite what the Ratliffs might be doing on TV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In fact, you shouldn’t even be using it daily: “Taking lorazepam alone two to three times a week or more is not the standard of care for somebody with an anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder,” says Dr. Varma. “Not only will it be insufficient, but a person will tend to take it daily, and soon find themselves developing tolerance and a physiological dependence on it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-is-it-best-for" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1f1zqqc emevuu60"&gt;Who is it best for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Lorazepam is best as a short-term solution for those dealing with acute anxiety or panic disorders, says Dr. Varma. It can also be prescribed for those who need short-term relief from insomnia or stress, or patients who require a sedative for certain medical procedures (for example, if you have claustrophobia and need an MRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="16" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="17" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-drink-while-taking-lorazepam" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1f1zqqc emevuu60"&gt;Can you drink while taking lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Nooooo, Ratliff family, no! It is not safe to drink while on this medication! “Both lorazepam and alcohol are central nervous system depressants, meaning they slow down brain activity and can lead to profound sedation, impaired coordination, and respiratory depression,” says Dr. Varma. “This combination can increase the risk of severe side effects such as extreme drowsiness, dizziness, fainting, and even respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.” Put down the vino, Victoria!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-should-not-take-lorazepam" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1f1zqqc emevuu60"&gt;Who should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take lorazepam?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There are a few groups of people who should avoid lorazepam, says Dr. Varma, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, elderly patients who may be more sensitive to sedation, and individuals with certain medical conditions that may react to the medication (like severe liver disease and acute narrow-angle glaucoma). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;People with a history of substance abuse should also steer clear, says Dr. Varma. “Due to its potential for addiction, individuals who have struggled with alcohol, prescription drugs, or other substances should generally avoid lorazepam.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-18" data-node-id="23" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="white lotus" title="white lotus" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/white-lotus-season3-jason2-67cf455b85da5.png?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/white-lotus-season3-jason2-67cf455b85da5.png?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/white-lotus-season3-jason2-67cf455b85da5.png?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/white-lotus-season3-jason2-67cf455b85da5.png?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-md1riv e1geg53v2"&gt;Max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-anyone-in-the-ratliff-family-taking-it-the-right-way" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1f1zqqc emevuu60"&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; in the Ratliff family taking it the right way? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Honestly...no. As Dr. Varma mentioned, you should really only take lorazepam when you’re experiencing extreme anxiety—think, like, mid-panic attack—and very sparingly, at that. Victoria seems to be popping ’em whenever she feels any emotion at all, several times a day, and her dependence on the drug began showing all the way back in episode 1. (One of my favorite lines this entire season: Piper, Victoria’s daughter, quipping, “You don’t have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Victoria also offered up her pills to her husband, which is always a major no-no. Sure, “what’s mine is yours” in marriage and all that jazz, but let this be a reminder that you should never give prescription drugs to someone whose name isn’t on the bottle. We saw Timothy sneakily swallow two lorazepam in a row during this last episode, and I, for one, am afraid to see what’s going to happen next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="27" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h3 css-15clsms emevuu60"&gt;MEET THE EXPERT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doctorsuevarma.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.doctorsuevarma.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sue Varma" class="body-link css-egnagj emevuu60"&gt;Sue Varma&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PC, DFAPA, is a board-certified psychiatrist, clinical assistant professor at NYU Langone Health, and a Distinguished Fellow at the American Psychiatric Association.

I’m Dr F. Perry Wilson from the Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study after study across diseases, from &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-019-1500-6"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567576923005532?via%3Dihub"&gt;Zika virus infection&lt;/a&gt;, has shown that low &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/drisdol-calciferol-vitamind-344417" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; level is a risk factor for bad outcomes. Seriously, I challenge you to find a disease state where there isn’t at least some data suggesting worse outcomes among people with vitamin D deficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, when the inevitable randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation comes around, you get nothing. It’s become a bit of a running joke on this blog — &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/975852"&gt;the compelling observational data shut down by the definitive randomized trial&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we have good data that low levels are associated with various problems but a failure to show that &lt;em&gt;correcting&lt;/em&gt; those levels makes a difference. The implication is simple: It’s the classic case of correlation vs causation. Low vitamin D levels are simply correlated with bad outcomes; they don’t &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; bad outcomes. It’s not actually the vitamin D that is causing the problem; people who are sick for other reasons just happen to have low vitamin D. I actually give a lecture to the med students citing just these studies to convince them that randomized trials are superior sources of evidence than observational research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, science demands that we reevaluate our priors when new data arrive. And new data have arrived, in the form of a randomized trial that, for once, shows a benefit of vitamin D supplementation. In just one disease, yes. But it’s an important one: &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1146199-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with lower vitamin D levels have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034817300664"&gt;higher risk for MS, and of those who develop MS, those with lower vitamin D levels have worse symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s the case with, well, just about every disease, because lower vitamin D levels are a marker of a lot of things: poorer health overall, less sun exposure, a less varied diet, and so on. It’s a biomarker of a healthy lifestyle. So, it’s not surprising that &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/147/4/1206/7469896"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31594857/"&gt;prior&lt;/a&gt; randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation in MS have been disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a trial can be negative for a few different reasons. There’s the common one: The treatment just doesn’t work for the disease. But there are other possibilities. Maybe the treatment was given at the wrong time, or when the disease had progressed too far. Or maybe the trial simply didn’t enroll enough people to detect a reasonable signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, from Eric Thouvenot and colleagues, appearing in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, remedies some of those prior deficits and suggests a new role for vitamin D in MS. Let’s break down how it worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators enrolled 316 individuals with “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS). CIS is basically the earliest possible presentation of MS, a first episode of an MS-like syndrome such as &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1217083-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt;. Not everyone with CIS will progress to full-blown MS, but many do. So, the first special fact about this trial is they are hitting these participants early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second important difference from some of the prior work is the vitamin D dose. The intervention group in this trial got 100,000 international units of oral cholecalciferol every 2 weeks. This is a big dose. The vitamin D3 you get at the local vitamin store is 1000 international units; this dose is 100 times that. Even dosed less frequently, it’s a lot. That is not without risk. Supratherapeutic doses of vitamin D can cause elevated calcium levels, &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/437096-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and so on. I’ll get to whether this happened in this study in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s look at the patient population. A fairly young group (remember, they were enrolled at the first MS-consistent symptom); the average age was around 35. Seventy percent were female and 40% were active smokers (the study was conducted in France, where smoking is more prevalent). About 20% had severe vitamin D insufficiency, a level less than 30 nmol/L. The average time to receiving either the vitamin D or placebo was about 60 days from the initial presentation. By that time, 80% of the study population had received high-dose steroid therapy, which is pretty much standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will point out that no one in this study received disease-modifying therapy such as interferon treatments; that was an exclusion criterion. So basically, this was a population of young individuals, newly diagnosed with early MS, who were not at super high risk for progression, at least at the time the study started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’m sure you want to see the results. The primary outcome of this study was “disease activity,” and you could hit that outcome in two ways. First, a relapse of symptoms. Second, the development of new or growing lesions on MRI. MS has some characteristic findings on brain scans. Participants got follow-up MRIs at 3, 12, and 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s take a look at what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in disease activity occurred in 74% of individuals in the placebo group, compared with 60% of individuals in the vitamin D group. That’s a 14% absolute risk reduction, which is fairly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="vim-asset aspen-align-middle ck-widget" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;img class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" src="https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ou_250310_fig6_689x388.jpg" alt="photo of High dose vitamin D" data-asset-description="High dose vitamin D" data-asset-id="6d0b6f03-3ac8-4b45-ab21-7c9328aa3b2e" data-asset-title="ou_250310_fig6_689x388.jpg" data-creditline="JAMA Network" data-source="JAMA Network" data-keywords="" data-path="/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ou_250310_fig6_689x388.jpg" data-asset-url="https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ou_250310_fig6_689x388.jpg" data-height="388" data-width="689" role="textbox" tabindex="-1" contenteditable="true"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-placeholder="Enter image Caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means that you would need to treat seven individuals with early MS with vitamin D to save one person from disease progression. That’s not bad, especially for a relatively inexpensive intervention like a vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median time to progression was significantly longer in the vitamin D group as well: 432 days vs 224 days in the placebo group. That’s around a 7-month difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, I’m impressed. But let’s take a look at some of the subgroup analyses to figure out what might really be going on here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I want to show you is the effect of vitamin D supplementation, stratified by baseline vitamin D level. What you see here is that the supplements are dramatically more effective when the patient has vitamin D insufficiency to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="vim-asset aspen-align-middle ck-widget" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;img class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" src="https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ou_250310_fig7_689x388.jpg" alt="photo of High dose vitamin D" data-asset-description="High dose vitamin D" data-asset-id="96aef790-a86f-4b9e-bb63-8162bfc72473" data-asset-title="ou_250310_fig7_689x388.jpg" data-creditline="F.

Once you hit a target — and for vitamin D something like 50 nmol/L might be reasonable — getting higher above that target doesn’t offer too much extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other significant finding was this: The vitamin was much more effective in people without spinal cord lesions — in other words, in people with a less severe initial presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="vim-asset aspen-align-middle ck-widget" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;img class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" src="https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ou_250310_fig8_689x388.jpg" alt="photo of High dose vitamin D" data-asset-description="High dose vitamin D" data-asset-id="b3d63643-75f4-4191-ad44-a7750dc0dcf2" data-asset-title="ou_250310_fig8_689x388.jpg" data-creditline="F.

The fact that they didn’t get that therapy suggests that their presentation was milder. So, should we be giving vitamin D only to those with an initial presentation of MS that is fairly mild?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="vim-asset aspen-align-middle ck-widget" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;img class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" src="https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ou_250310_fig9_689x388.jpg" alt="photo of High dose vitamin D" data-asset-description="High dose vitamin D" data-asset-id="b862164a-42c8-4517-913a-4366f2eae8ae" data-asset-title="ou_250310_fig9_689x388.jpg" data-creditline="F.

If it’s very risky, you’ll want to limit its use. If not, well, maybe it’s not as effective in those with worse disease but maybe it couldn’t hurt?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty darn safe. Only two patients developed &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/240681-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;hypercalcemia&lt;/a&gt; during the trial, and both of them were in the placebo group. No one developed severe hypercalcemia or kidney failure. It may be a bit early to look for kidney stones, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s hard to look at this trial as anything except a powerful and — to me, at least — unexpected victory for high-dose vitamin D supplementation in early MS. I think those testing vitamin D for other disease states, who look at the literature and see all those negative trials, might do well to learn some lessons from this study. If you want to design the next positive randomized trial of vitamin D, maybe start supplementation early, and when you supplement, go for big doses. Will it work for all those diseases, from Alzheimer’s to &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2500035-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt;? Of course not. But the first step to finding therapies that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; work is to design the proper study to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;F.

&lt;p&gt;A shocking discovery in &lt;strong&gt;Maszycka Cave&lt;/strong&gt;, located in southern Poland, has uncovered startling evidence that cannibalism was practiced by Magdalenian humans around 18,000 years ago. This unsettling revelation was detailed in a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86093-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in February 2025&lt;/a&gt;, revealing the first clear signs of nutritional cannibalism from this period. Excavations in Maszycka Cave have uncovered cut marks and intentional fractures on human bones, pointing to a deliberate and systematic butchery of human remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The Magdalenian people, known for their hunter-gatherer lifestyle during the Upper Paleolithic, left behind evidence of cultural practices that now seem both eerie and revealing. The analysis of the human remains found in the cave suggests that these early humans consumed parts of the bodies, rather than simply using them for ritual purposes as some previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Discovery in Maszycka Cave&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maszycka Cave&lt;/strong&gt;, located in the southern region of &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/sword-of-sobieski-military-history-of-poland/" data-type="post" data-id="69397"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, has long been a site of interest for archaeologists studying prehistoric humans. The remains found here date back to the Magdalenian period, a time when humans were transitioning between the Upper Paleolithic and the Mesolithic eras. The cave’s dark history, filled with skeletons and bones, has sparked much speculation, but it wasn’t until recent technological advancements that scientists were able to take a closer look at the remains to confirm what was once only suspected—cannibalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, Maszycka Cave yielded skeletal remains that were initially examined but never fully analyzed. Later in the 1990s, some researchers suggested signs of cannibalistic activity, but these theories were inconclusive. Modern technology—specifically 3D scanning—allowed researchers to revisit these findings with greater precision. 63 human bone fragments were studied, revealing cut marks, fractures, and even indications that brain, marrow, and muscle were deliberately removed for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from the cut marks and fractures found on the bones. Francesc Marginedas, a researcher at&lt;a href="http://comunicacio.iphes.cat/spa/p/news/new/noticias/v/category/1/750.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; IPHES-CERCA&lt;/a&gt;, states, “The location and frequency of the cut marks and the intentional fracturing of the skeleton clearly show a nutritional exploitation of the bodies, ruling out the hypothesis of a funerary treatment without consumption.” This means that the cuts were not made out of respect or ceremonial purposes, but for the extraction of edible tissue, further suggesting that cannibalism was practiced for nourishment rather than symbolic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that these cuts were made in the most nutritious parts of the body—such as the muscles, brain, and marrow—indicating a clear intent to utilize the bodies for sustenance. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that cannibalism was not only a response to environmental pressures but may have been ingrained in ritualistic practices or survival strategies, with early human communities turning to the consumption of their own kind in times of scarcity or cultural customs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cannibalism Across Europe: A Widespread Practice?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evidence from&lt;strong&gt; Maszycka Cave&lt;/strong&gt; adds to the growing body of research on prehistoric cannibalism in Europe. Similar findings have been made at several other European caves from the Magdalenian period, such as Gough’s Cave in the UK, Brillenhöhle Cave in Germany, Cueva Morín in Spain, and the Cro-Magnon rock shelter in France. These sites also contain skeletons with cut marks and fractures, pointing to widespread cannibalistic practices among ancient European humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While such discoveries have been made, the reasons behind this cannibalism remain open to interpretation. Some researchers argue that the consumption of human flesh could have been a ritualistic act, possibly part of spiritual beliefs. Others suggest that it may have been a practical measure during periods of famine, where humans resorted to consuming the dead out of necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Modern Technology Sheds New Light on Ancient Practices&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What sets the discovery in Maszycka Cave apart from past findings is the use of cutting-edge technology in analyzing the bones. The 3D scanning technology provided a detailed examination of the bones, allowing scientists to see if the marks were caused by human activity or natural processes. By using this advanced method, the researchers were able to distinguish between marks made by tools and those made by animals, providing irrefutable evidence of deliberate human action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The ability to study bones in this level of detail has opened new doors for understanding ancient practices that were previously speculative. As Dr. Marginedas notes, “The location and frequency of the cut marks and the intentional fracturing of the skeleton clearly show a nutritional exploitation of the bodies.” This is not just an instance of scavenging, but a carefully executed process aimed at extracting the most valuable parts of the human body for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The future of medicine just might include prosthetic penises that can be printed on demand. In a study out this month, scientists have demonstrated that their 3D-printed penile implant can restore sexual function in animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S., Japan, and China conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in Nature Biomedical Engineering. In experiments with both pigs and rabbits that had damaged penile tissue, their 3D-printed gel-based implant allowed the injured animals to successfully mate and reproduce as usual. The technology could lead to better functional replacements for penises as well as other organs that are rich in blood vessels, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000574060" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000574060" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000574060" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1.jpg" alt="Biomimeticpenis 1024x369" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1.jpg 1024w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-300x108.jpg 300w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-768x277.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-680x245.jpg 680w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369-1-896x323.jpg 896w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000574060" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team’s biomimetic model of a penis’s head and corpus cavernosum. © Wang et al/Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The penis is a complex organ, thanks to the intricate network of blood vessels and tissues needed to engorge it. Scientists have historically struggled to create models in the lab that can accurately replicate the structures of vessel-rich organs like the penis, but the researchers said they’ve made a major step forward with their latest work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, they created a model of the glans, the “head” of the penis, and the corpus spongiosum, the spongy column of tissue along the penile shaft that surrounds the urethra and contains the blood vessels responsible for making the penis erect (blood flows into the arteries of the penis, which also presses up against the veins there, keeping the blood in place and the penis rigid). The team’s model even mimicked the urethral structures found in a typical penis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, they 3D-printed a gel-based scaffold modeled after the corpus spongiosum, one designed to withstand the enlargement of a penis during sex. These implants were then transplanted into rabbits and pigs that had a partly damaged corpus spongiosum. The researchers also seeded some of their implants with endothelial cells (cells that line the blood vessels) from the animals, hoping that the fusion would improve their odds of being functional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000574055" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000574055" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000574055" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant.jpg" alt="Pigpenisimplant" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant.jpg 968w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-279x300.jpg 279w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-953x1024.jpg 953w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-768x825.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-633x680.jpg 633w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/PigPenisImplant-834x896.jpg 834w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000574055" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From top to bottom: Images showing a normal pig penis; a penis with a damaged corpus cavernosum; and a pig penis repaired with the team’s implant fused with endothelial cells two weeks after the transplant. © Wang et al/Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The implants seemed to significantly improve the animals’ erectile function within weeks, especially when they were seeded with endothelial cells. Overall, the animals with fused implants had improved tissue regeneration and their erectile function essentially returned to normal, even allowing them to reproduce with 100% effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fertility of the [endothelial cell] groups demonstrates the recovery of erectile function and the ability to ejaculate, suggesting the restoration of the cavernous tissue in the treated males,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results only show off a proof-of-concept for now. The scientists note that more research will be needed to develop implants capable of regenerating and restoring more severely damaged penises in humans. But they say that their model should make it easier to study erectile dysfunction, and they believe that their work can foster the creation of truly impressive replacements for the penis and similar organs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the further development of 3D-printed blood-vessel-rich functional organs for transplantation,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the Hector Institute for Translational Brain Research (HITBR) at the Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH) in Mannheim provides the first detailed cellular insights into how psilocin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, promotes the growth and networking of human nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;These findings complement clinical studies on the treatment of mental disorders and could contribute to a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms behind the therapeutic effect of psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is the well-known &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/active+ingredient/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;active ingredient&lt;/a&gt; in so-called magic mushrooms, which is converted in the body to psilocin—the compound that ultimately unleashes the psychoactive effect. The Mannheim research team worked directly with psilocin to investigate the neurobiological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their current study, which has been &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/104006v1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;, the researchers investigated its effect on human nerve cells that they had cultivated from stem cells. The result: Even a single dose of psilocin was sufficient to induce various changes in human nerve cells within a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More connections, more communication, altered gene activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we observed is fascinating," explains Dr. Malin Schmidt, first author of the study. "The nerve cells formed more branches and produced more BDNF, an endogenous growth factor for nerve cells." What is even more astonishing is that synaptic changes persisted even after several days and communication between the nerve cells increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to prove that psilocin changes the activity of certain genes that are important for the brain's ability to adapt. This so-called neuroplasticity is reduced in many &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+illnesses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental illnesses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Put simply, psilocin makes the brain more malleable again," explains study leader Prof. Dr. Philipp Koch. "Our results provide explanations at the cellular level for the positive effects observed in clinical studies with psilocybin in patients with depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Better understanding of neurobiological mechanisms of action for new therapeutic approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work complements the clinical studies already underway at the CIMH and other research institutions worldwide, in which psilocybin is being investigated as a treatment option for various mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical studies&lt;/a&gt; are investigating the efficacy in patients, our current work provides important insights into the underlying biological processes," emphasizes Koch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mannheim researchers used the iPSC technology (induced pluripotent stem cells) for their experiments. This makes it possible to grow functional nerve cells from human stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With this modern cell system, we can investigate the effect of substances directly on human &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nerve&lt;/a&gt; cells," explains Koch. "This is an enormous advantage over conventional studies on animal models, as we can observe the processes in a fully human system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research results deepen the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of action of psilocybin and could help to further optimize psychedelic therapies that are already undergoing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With this better understanding of the cellular mechanisms, we may be able to take a more targeted approach and refine the therapeutic protocols," concludes Koch.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/07/how-americans-view-alcohols-benefits-and-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;new Pew survey out last Friday&lt;/a&gt; examines how people feel about their own alcohol use and drinking habits. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted between Feb. 24 and March 2 of this year, focused on adults in the U.S. aged 21 and older. One major finding is that people continue to drink even when they believe it may not be beneficial to their well-being. It raises the question of what that experience is like!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Three things to know:&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/07/how-americans-view-alcohols-benefits-and-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;to the survey&lt;/a&gt;, 57% of drinkers believe that their alcohol consumption does not increase their risk of serious health problems, while 43% think it does — either to a high degree or somewhat.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite these beliefs, 41% of drinkers say that recent news regarding the link between &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5246590/drinking-alcohol-increases-the-risk-for-at-least-7-types-of-cancer-new-report-shows" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; will prompt them to reduce their drinking, with 11% indicating they will cut back a lot and 30% saying they will reduce it a little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The health impacts of drinking have been extensively covered, addressing topics ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2024/12/new-report-reviews-evidence-on-moderate-alcohol-consumption-and-health-impacts#:~:text=Cardiovascular%20Disease%20%E2%80%94%20The%20report%20concludes,lower%20risk%20of%20cardiovascular%20mortality" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/03/nx-s1-5246590/drinking-alcohol-increases-the-risk-for-at-least-7-types-of-cancer-new-report-shows" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. NPR's Allison Aubrey recently &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/13/nx-s1-5251649/cancer-alcohol-wine-beer-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;broke down the things to consider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This includes a&lt;a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcohol/rehab-treatment/cage-questionnaire-assessment" target="_blank"&gt; self-assessment quiz&lt;/a&gt; called the CAGE questionnaire, which consists of four questions designed to help people determine if they need to manage their drinking habits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The herb rosemary has long been linked with memory. "There's rosemary, that's for remembrance," says Ophelia in Shakespeare's "Hamlet." So it is fitting that researchers would study a compound found in rosemary and sage—carnosic acid—for its impact on Alzheimer's disease. In the disease, which is the leading cause of dementia and the sixth-leading cause of death in the US, inflammation is one component that often leads to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Carnosic acid is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound that works by activating enzymes that make up the body's natural defense system. While pure carnosic acid is too unstable to be used as a drug, scientists at Scripps Research have now synthesized a stable form, diAcCA. This compound is fully converted to carnosic acid in the gut before being absorbed into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/i&gt;, showed that when diAcCA was used to treat mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, it achieved therapeutic doses of carnosic acid in the brain and led to enhanced memory and synaptic density, or more synapses (representing the connections between nerve cells), in the brain. Because the decline of neuronal synapses is also closely correlated to dementia in Alzheimer's disease, this approach could counteract the progression of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of tissue samples showed the drug also markedly decreased inflammation in the brain. This unique drug is activated by the very inflammation that it then combats and thus is only active in areas of the brain undergoing inflammatory damage. This selectivity limits the potential side effects of carnosic acid, which is on the US Food and Drug Administration's "generally regarded as safe" (GRAS) list, easing the way for clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"By combating inflammation and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; with this diAcCA compound, we actually increased the number of synapses in the brain," says senior author and professor Stuart Lipton, MD, Ph.D., the Step Family Foundation Endowed Chair at Scripps Research and a clinical neurologist in La Jolla, California. "We also took down other misfolded or aggregated proteins such as phosphorylated-tau and amyloid-β, which are thought to trigger Alzheimer's disease and serve as biomarkers of the disease process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipton's group had &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27906174/" target="_blank"&gt;previously determined&lt;/a&gt; that carnosic acid crosses the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood-brain+barrier/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; and activates the Nrf2 transcriptional pathway, which turns on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory genes. But the compound oxidizes easily, making it unsuitable as a drug because of its short shelf-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new study, Lipton and co-author Phil Baran, Ph.D., the Dr. Richard A. Lerner Endowed Chair in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps Research, synthesized a range of carnosic acid derivatives and selected diAcCA as the best candidate because of its stability, bioavailability, and other drug-like properties. Lipton's group then treated mouse models with the compound over the course of three months. The group examined the mice by testing their spatial learning and memory in behavioral tests and then analyzing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tissue&lt;/a&gt; under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug," Lipton says. "And it didn't just slow down the decline; it improved virtually back to normal." Analysis of tissues also showed increased neuronal synaptic density and decreased formation of phosphorylated-tau aggregates and amyloid-β plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice tolerated diAcCA well. In toxicity studies, the compound even soothed baseline inflammation in the esophagus and stomach as it was converted to carnosic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also found that the mice took up about 20% more carnosic acid after ingesting diAcCA than they did after taking plain carnosic acid. Because most carnosic acid oxidizes while being stored or upon ingestion, "diAcCA produces more carnosic acid in the blood than if you took carnosic acid itself," Lipton explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipton sees a potential for diAcCA to work in tandem with Alzheimer's treatments currently on the market. Not only could the drug work on its own by combating inflammation, but "it could make existing amyloid antibody treatments work better by taking away or limiting their side effects," such as a form of brain swelling or bleeding known as ARIA-E and ARIA-H, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipton hopes diAcCA can be fast-tracked through clinical trials because of its safety profile. He thinks it could also be explored as a treatment for other disorders marked by inflammation, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other forms of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Lipton and Baran, authors of the study include Piu Banerjee, Yubo Wang, Lauren N. Carnevale, Parth Patel, Charlene K Raspur, Nancy Tran, Xu Zhang, and Amanda J. Roberts of Scripps Research and Ravi Natarajan of Socrates Biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This 7-day meal plan is set at 1,800 calories per day, with modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ample protein and fiber support sustained energy levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This plan prioritizes nutritious whole foods while avoiding added sugar and limiting ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking for an energy boost? Most of us would appreciate a little more pep in our step and, thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; may be able to help. Research links following this nutritious eating style with a reduced incidence of fatigue in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In this seven-day high-fiber, high-protein routine, you’ll find a wide variety of proteins, whole grains, fresh produce and healthy fats. What you won’t find is any &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899305/top-sources-of-added-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;. We limit ultra-processed foods and refined grains and completely skip added sugars in this plan. To keep you full and energized between meals, we prioritize foods rich in fiber and protein. These two nutrients are digested more slowly than refined grains and simple sugars and can help promote satiety. Each day in this plan provides an average of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;99 grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;35 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt;. We set this plan at 1,800 calories per day and included modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories per day to support those with other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8033186/what-are-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;calorie needs&lt;/a&gt;. While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! If there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/no-added-sugar-recipes-8660360" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;no-sugar-added recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. We aimed for at least 28 grams of fiber and 90 grams of protein per day. If you’re closely monitoring calories, you may want to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile or adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if that’s easier for your routine. The breakfasts are between 344 and 370 calories, while the lunches span 354 to 478 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is a flexible way of eating that emphasizes an array of protein sources, including seafood, legumes, poultry, nuts, dairy, eggs and meat. It includes whole grains, an abundance of fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds and healthy fats. It limits ultra-processed foods, refined grains and added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_181-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057767/10-surprising-foods-with-more-sugar-than-a-glazed-donut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt; are, as the name implies, sugars that are added during processing to add sweetness. Added sugars include high-fructose corn syrup, sugar, agave, honey, maple syrup and more. You’ll find added sugars in the usual suspects, like sweetened drinks and desserts, but you may be surprised to learn what other foods contain added sugars. You’ll often find them in foods like breads, crackers, granola bars, bottled salad dressings and sauces. While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292028/how-many-grams-of-sugar-should-you-eat-per-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; are fine in moderation for most people, many of us are eating more added sugars than we realize. The average American adult consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day—considerably above the American Heart Association’s recommended daily max of 6 teaspoons for women and 9 for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A high intake of added sugar is linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

They found that those who consumed just seven grams of olive oil per day had a 28% lower risk of dementia-related death when compared with those who never or rarely consumed olive oil, regardless of overall diet.

Having adequate levels of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant, is essential for neutralizing harmful free radicals and mitigating oxidative stress in the brain, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, although olive oil has some profound health benefits, like anything, when consumed in excess, it's not great. "It is still &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63980516/highest-calorie-fast-food-menu-items/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a63980516/highest-calorie-fast-food-menu-items/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calorie-dense" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;calorie-dense&lt;/a&gt;, and excessive consumption can lead to weight gain," Dr. Patel tells us. "Therefore, moderation in intake is recommended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-the-type-of-olive-oil-you-consume-matter" data-node-id="13" class="css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Does The Type Of Olive Oil You Consume Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just like with cooking, the type of olive oil you consume matters, not just for quality, but for brain benefits, as well. "Organic extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), cold-pressed, contains the highest concentration of polyphenols and antioxidants that support brain health," Dr. Braun, who prescribes custom creams containing olive oil to her patients, tells us. Both of these play a crucial role in mitigating inflammation and oxidative stress, two key contributors to cognitive decline, Dr. Patel explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While Dr. Braun recommends trying different oils to find your personal favorite, she does have tips to help you find those worth their salt. "Many commercially available olive oils are blends from various countries, making it difficult to maintain supply chain oversight and potentially reducing their health benefits," she says. Looking for cold-press unrefined oil from a single-source, organic producer will help ensure you're getting what you're paying for. "It's also important to choose oils that are certified and have been tested for purity and quality," says Dr. Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-else-you-need-to-know" data-node-id="17" class="css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;What Else You Need To Know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the findings of this study are clear, there are also some important factors you need to take into consideration to reap the most from your olive oil consumption. First off, olive oil needs to be stored in a cool, dark place in order to prevent it from losing its &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/a61556635/are-cherries-healthy/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/kitchen-secrets/a61556635/are-cherries-healthy/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="health benefits" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, explains Dr. Patel. This tip will also help you find suitable EVOOs at the store—always look for a dark bottle that prevents sunlight from degrading it. Many professionals recommend storing olive oil in a ceramic jar due to its ability to block out air, light, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Patel also cautions avoid cooking olive oil at high temperatures, which can degrade the polyphenols found in olive oil, lowering anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. The North America Olive Oil association notes that the average &lt;a href="https://www.aboutoliveoil.org/olive-oil-smoke-point" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.aboutoliveoil.org/olive-oil-smoke-point" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="smoke point for extra virgin olive oil" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;smoke point for extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; ranges anywhere from 350° to 410° Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Make sure to use your olive oil in a timely manner. While unopened, bottles can last up to a year after the oil's harvest date; once you open a bottle, the clock starts ticking. It's typically recommended to use up your olive oil within a month or two of opening—it might be better to buy those smaller bottles so you aren't wasting any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you're looking for ways to sneak in some extra olive oil into your daily routine, it's great for drizzling atop a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/nutrition/g2599/healthy-dinner-salads/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/cooking/nutrition/g2599/healthy-dinner-salads/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="homemade salad" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;homemade salad&lt;/a&gt; or adding to dishes after cooking.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Nick Norwitz, a researcher-educator specializing in metabolism, claims that the high fructose content in fruits can be harmful &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers discovered mice who were fed high-fructose corn syrup for four weeks had the villi (fingerlike projections that absorb nutrients from food) inside their small intestines to be about 40 percent longer than their counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those fed high-fructose corn syrup also gained significantly more weight and fat mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists concluded fructose improved the survival of cells in the villi which caused it to lengthen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a high number of cells and longer villi, the body would absorb more nutrients. This could lead to increased fat absorption and weight gain when combined with a high-fat diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists also examined the effects of fructose on colorectal cancer cells and discovered that it could increase tumor growth by helping the toxic cells live longer in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some studies suggest that fructose can cause damage, a 2014 literature review by National Institute of Medicine found that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11722715/Are-fruit-phobe-Doctors-debunk-common-myth-fruit-bad-you.html"&gt;fructose does not have specific effects &lt;/a&gt;on the body that can cause weight gain compared with eating sugar from other sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, experts at the the American Heart Association, point out that mango has more than 20 vitamins and minerals, including high doses of vitamins A and C, high fiber content and tons of antioxidants that are 'beneficial for colon cancer prevention, heart disease and weight control.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fruits in general are also widely beneficial for regular bowel movements and digestion due to their high fiber content and is packed with vitamins that help improve eye health, boost immune system through antioxidants and regulate blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Norwitz named mango as the highest fructose containing fruit - with about 30 grams of fructose in a full-sized mango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Harvard and Oxford University graduate explained the negative effects of high fructose consumption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fructose is a sugar found naturally in fruits, some vegetables and honey. It is also commonly added to processed foods in the form of high fructose corn syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Manufacturers use high fructose corn syrup to make sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods sodas, breakfast cereals, dairy products such as yogurts and candies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After mangoes, Dr Norwitz then noted that jackfruit has around 15.2 grams of fructose in a cup as compared to a cup blueberries which only has 7.6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fruit has become incredibly popular in recent years as a plant-based meat alternative due to its texture being remarkably similar to pulled meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those suffering from diabetes or are at risk of having low blood sugar levels may be advised to steer clear of jackfruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 peer study published in the Scientific World Journal discovered that jackfruit extract may increase insulin levels and significantly lower blood glucose levels - creating danger for those with fluctuating sugar levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that mice who had been fed extract from jackfruit leaves had elevated insulin and reduced blood glucose levels compared to others who had eaten a control diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists concluded that that jackfruit leaf extract contains flavonoids that may help prevent cell death in the pancreas, which is the organ that produces insulin, therefore increase the production of insulin the body and reduce blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden decrease in blood sugar can cause difficulty concentrating, dizziness, chest pain and seizures. In the long run, it can also cause brain damage and sometimes, death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, jackfruit is known to be good source of vitamin C, which is a powerful antioxidant that is essential for a healthy immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also known to produce substances called phytochemicals (plant-based chemical compounds), such as flavonoids, saponins and tannins that have cancer-fighting benefits, such as preventing cancer cells from forming in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though it has gained reputation as a replacement for pork or chicken in many main dishes, jackfruit cannot compete with these animal products in terms of protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One cup of raw jackfruit has less than three grams of protein while a cup of typical everyday meats such as chicken have 38 grams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Norwitz then noted that jackfruit is extremely harmful to the body &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regardless of color, grapes have 12.3 grams of fructose per cup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, the metabolism expert warned of the dangers of grapes due to their high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regardless of color, grapes have 12.3 grams of fructose per cup as compared to a banana with just 5.7 grams of fructose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too many grapes at once can cause the body to not absorb fructose efficiently and lead to bloating, gas and stomach upset, especially if eaten on an empty stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the tannins in grapes can also irritate the stomach lining, potentially causing discomfort and diarrhea in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But previous research has shown that grape consumption supports heart health and  improvements in memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some lower-fructose fruits include berries, kiwi, citrus fruits and non-sweet, low-carb fruits like coconut, avocado and olives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that adults eat 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 18:25:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQUEJoNjgyLVp2cDdJTXU3TEIzdjZuRlNIcm1nYWJDY0lwUGpKNHRyU1hEbl9yRUg4Mk16V2tPbFgtUGVkZVAzLUZwb2RMd3ctWTdYYmpOTzAwUEZ2S2tYM3JxbmdFTDR6WmE4eWlRQ1h2YXgydFBHNmliODlfRnNVLVNaSk5mVUVGa0staTA3eXVDdFdNRVVwcUlOMjRCeWEwQVFB0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1ZY29wNTdta3V2TThRRkRPVF9xLXJWNkVKU01jakZlN1dnaFYweWxPWlVMdVZCdkFBNmtmSGFxbTE1dUNlRllMdzltR0RIMHRnb1pxaFlHWTFKUG05Nk10dldsa0xVY3BhQ25VMEhNQmZXVnRUcjNNMnhQd1F0dmhsaDJrTXc5UDAxUFIxZ0hLQkVsYkxXUEVBUDdoVkVrODBmMUtuaHpZSw</guid></item><item><title>Citrus Fruit Consumption Helps Protect Against Depression via Gut Microbiome: Study - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQdWR2OWFrMUlMUXZya1pWbnB6SjYtc3d4bF96b29lR05ZbU9yV3lkejBTQnhSOUIzQXg2V3RXQ1ZjNE1yUllBWHk3eXlMWmhQQURaZnRqNHl1Nlh3RXpQNkJVWkkzUXF6UzJtZUxxbUt1UE9wTWVhYVM0ekZjclBlazhpX19tLVM5TTZVUnVKOGltZFM0OXVTVTRiakpXRExTa3lPU20xZEw2SmhtU0J0S0x0VGw5QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study has identified several corresponding lines of evidence which all point like a divining rod to citrus fruit being associated with lower risks of developing depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical depression affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, 70% of whom fail to respond to medication. The causes are varied and difficult to understand, but being that you can’t medicate your way out of a poor diet, one scientist thought he’d look for a dietary solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Raaj Mehta, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, has found evidence that just one medium-sized orange can reduce a person’s risk of developing depression by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was working with a fantastic postdoc named Chatpol Samuthpongtorn, who was reading through the literature on depression, looking for an interesting project to take on,” Dr. Mehta &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/02/eating-citrus-may-lower-depression-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explained to the Harvard Gazette.&lt;/a&gt; “And he came across this one paper from 2016 that pointed to the possibility that citrus lowers the risk of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That piqued our interest because we had access to a rich data set that we could use to follow up on this finding. It’s called the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS2), and it began in 1989 with the goal of finding risk factors for major chronic diseases in women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It involves over 100,000 women, and roughly every two years they provide researchers with detailed information about their lifestyle, diet, medication use, and health. So we decided to leverage these data to look for evidence that nurses who ate a lot of citrus had lower rates of future depression than those who did not. And that’s what we found!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mehta’s findings show that total fruit and vegetable consumption was not correlated with anything—citrus stood alone as a deciding factor, and it worked, he later hypothesized, by increasing the total amounts of a gut bacterial species &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii. &lt;/em&gt;Citrus increased the population of this species in the guts of the nurses who consumed the most citrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER STORIES LIKE THIS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Healthy Gut Bacteria Can Reduce Risk of Asthma and Food Allergies in Children, Experts Discover" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/healthy-gut-bacteria-can-reduce-asthma-and-food-allergies-in-children-au-study/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Healthy Gut Bacteria Can Reduce Risk of Asthma and Food Allergies in Children, Experts Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, because the NHS2 contained only women, he looked for the same parameters and gut microbes in men, and the findings remained: 20% reduced risk of depression, higher levels of &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked how this data might work to reduce depression, Dr. Mehta suggested the S-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle I pathway may be utilized by these bacteria as a way to influence human neurotransmitters dopamine and seratonin, produced by human cells in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much evidence now suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain that I was not surprised to find more,” he told the Gazette. “At the same time, I had not associated citrus with the brain before we got these results. You often hear that fish is ‘brain food,’ but nobody says that oranges are brain food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One future question would be whether the effect was unique to oranges. Could it be replicated with lemons, bergamot, grapefruit, tangerines, or limes?&lt;/p&gt;

Many of the award winners have gone on to receive Nobel prizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Björkman grew up in Oregon and studied at the University of Oregon, Harvard and Stanford before moving to Caltech to begin teaching in 1989. Her research focuses on how the immune system identifies invading pathogens. She has broken ground, the fund said, in how scientists understand T-cell recognition and immunization strategies for HIV. T cells are white blood cells that help fight off diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, she has worked on developing a new strategy to design immunogens that trigger certain antibodies against coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Pamela Björkman’s work provides a glimpse of a new rational design strategy for future vaccines to deal with humanity’s greatest immunization challenges,” wrote the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This year’s prize in architecture was awarded to Chinese architect Tiantian Xu for her work in rural China, which the prize committee said “transformed villages throughout China economically, socially, and culturally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Xu studied architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design before returning to China, starting her own firm and working on a number of public projects that have kickstarted village economies, the fund said. They include a bridge connecting two villages separated by a flood, factories for tofu and brown sugar and renovating abandoned stone quarries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It lauded her “pioneering approach to rural development — one that contrasts with the sweeping, uniform strategies that characterized China’s urban expansion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other recipients of this year's award include Jeffery Dangl of the University of North Carolina, Jonathan Jones of the Sainsbury Laboratory in England and Brian Staskawicz of the University of California, Berkeley for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Also receiving the prize are professors Jainendra Jain of Pennsylvania State University, Moty Heiblum of Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science, James Eisenstein of Caltech in physics and Helmut Schwarz of the Technische Universität Berlin in chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Past laureates include astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, artist Marc Chagall, conductor Zubin Mehta and musician Stevie Wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 17:56:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOS05xbGZBRWZsT3RNdXI3RUFpX3E5MXN1SlhPOTAxYllmRTRlRG5fc19QOUhkMjZPQTdpSDJUT3ZJZzJCM2x0eTUxMk9qM0tQb3hZdk5aY1I3RVJ0ck9ZTjVTMEVnTC1JLTNjOEl5S2RZQnd1bHhxWHBMVHYtT0FlSkduY1pNdGlK</guid></item><item><title>Why Older People May Not Need to Watch Blood Sugar So Closely - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5wdTM0QmxENThPc1FVRFVldUJhcW85MjZPa1V0YlpmY1ZMZDFKZFhYQWZwd0VYSHRVR19wV0U1UXRlU1J5M0VVeXpRcmNlMzN0V0JONUZ4WGlxLW5QcHVJMUN6NEYweW5JYXV5RU10YW5jaG5UNV9JMDk5bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By now, Ora Larson recognizes what’s happening. “It feels like you’re shaking inside,” she said. “I’m speeded up.

While previous research has identified microplastics in organs such as the liver, kidneys, and placenta, this study suggests that the brain may be especially vulnerable to these tiny synthetic particles. The findings raise pressing questions about the potential effects of plastic buildup on brain health, particularly in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of microplastics and nanoplastics in our environment has grown exponentially over the last 50 years. These tiny plastic particles, ranging in size from microscopic to the width of a pencil eraser, are now found everywhere – in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil where our food grows. While it is known that these particles are making their way into the human body, lodging in organs like the liver, kidneys, and even the placenta, the extent of their accumulation and their potential for harm are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some studies in cells and animals have shown negative effects, those studies often used amounts of microplastics much higher than what humans are typically exposed to. A real understanding of the issue requires knowing how much plastic is actually accumulating in different human tissues. Until recently, we lacked reliable methods for measuring these tiny particles, particularly the smallest ones (nanoplastics), in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences, led by toxicologist Matthew Campen, developed a new way to detect and measure microplastics in human tissue. They previously used this method to examine placentas and testes. In this new study, they applied the technique to human brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain tissue samples came from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, which keeps tissue from autopsies for several years. The researchers compared older tissue samples (from around 2016) with more recent samples (from 2024). All the brain tissue analyzed was from the frontal cortex, the area of the brain located behind the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the microplastics, the researchers first chemically dissolved the tissue. This created a liquid mixture. They then spun this mixture at very high speeds in a machine called a centrifuge. This process separated out any undissolved materials, including plastics, into a small pellet. Next, they heated this pellet to a very high temperature (600 degrees Celsius), a process that breaks down the plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the plastics burned, they released gases. The researchers then used a sophisticated instrument called a mass spectrometer to identify the specific types of plastic based on the gases released. This allowed them to determine both the quantity and type of plastic present in the original brain tissue. The team could identify 12 different polymers. In addition to this chemical analysis, the researchers also used powerful microscopes, including a transmission electron microscope, to directly visualize the plastic particles in the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found surprisingly high levels of microplastics in the brain tissue. The concentration of plastics in the brain was much greater than that found in the liver or kidney samples. It was also higher than levels previously reported in placentas and testes. The median amount of total plastics for 2024 brain samples was 4917 micrograms per gram, and for 2016 samples, it was 3345 micrograms per gram. For comparison, the 2024 liver and kidney samples were 433 and 404 micrograms per gram, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more concerning was the finding that the amount of plastic in the brain was increasing over time. Brain tissue samples from 2024 had significantly higher levels of microplastics than samples from 2016, representing an approximate 50% increase in just eight years. The predominant type of plastic found in the brain was polyethylene, a common plastic used in packaging, bottles, and cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using electron microscopy, the researchers were able to see very small, sharp-edged plastic particles, some as small as 200 nanometers in size (which is only slightly larger than some viruses). These tiny particles are small enough to potentially cross the protective barrier that normally separates the bloodstream from the brain, although the exact mechanism by which these plastics are entering the brain is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look at trends over a longer time period, the researchers also analyzed brain tissue samples from the eastern United States, dating back as far as 1997. These older samples showed lower levels of microplastics, supporting the idea that plastic accumulation in the brain is increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another striking finding was that brain tissue from individuals who had been diagnosed with dementia contained significantly higher levels of microplastics – up to 10 times more – than brain tissue from people without dementia. While the study does not establish a direct causal link between plastic accumulation and neurodegenerative diseases, it raises important questions. The researchers speculate that microplastics could contribute to neurological conditions by obstructing blood flow, interfering with neural connections, or triggering inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We start thinking that maybe these plastics obstruct blood flow in capillaries,” Campen said. “There’s the potential that these nanomaterials interfere with the connections between axons in the brain. They could also be a seed for aggregation of proteins involved in dementia. We just don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes that food, especially meat, is the primary source of microplastics entering the body, as commercial meat production tends to accumulate plastic particles within the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,” Campen said. “We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Avoid Microplastics and Future Research Directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate commentary on the study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml?body=FullText" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, emphasized the significance of these findings and the urgent need for further investigation. The commentary noted that while the presence of microplastics in the human brain is concerning, scientists still do not fully understand their impact on brain function. It is unclear whether microplastics actively contribute to neurodegenerative diseases or whether people with dementia accumulate more plastic simply because their brains are less able to clear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming,” said Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry, the lead author of the commentary. “This rise mirrors the exponential increase we’re seeing in environmental microplastic levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important for the public to be aware of the increasing amounts of microplastics in the environment and uptake into our bodies. We should also understand the methods available to help reduce microplastic intake while research continues seeking methods to their removal from our bodies, which continues to be scarce in evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies have suggested that microplastics could affect brain health. Experiments on fish have shown that exposure to nanoplastics impairs swimming ability and hunting behavior. In mice, prolonged exposure to microplastics led to memory deficits, inflammation, and reduced levels of key proteins involved in brain function. While these studies indicate potential risks, more research is needed to determine whether similar effects occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary also highlighted the increasing presence of microplastics in food and water. People who drink bottled water, for example, ingest significantly more microplastics than those who consume tap water. Heating food in plastic containers has been shown to release billions of plastic particles into food, raising concerns about dietary exposure. Other sources of microplastic ingestion include seafood, processed foods, and even tea bags, which can release millions of tiny plastic particles when steeped in hot water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined,” said Brandon Luu, an Internal Medicine Resident at the University of Toronto. “Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90%, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heating food in plastic containers—especially in the microwave—can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics,” he explains. “Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to reduce microplastic exposure may help limit their accumulation in the body, but it is unclear whether this would lead to a reduction in brain plastic levels over time. The commentary suggested that more studies should focus on potential methods of eliminating microplastics from the body. Some research has indicated that plastic-related chemicals like bisphenol A can be excreted through sweat, raising the possibility that exercise or sauna use could aid in microplastic removal. However, no direct evidence currently exists to confirm whether the human body can effectively clear accumulated microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary concludes by emphasizing the need for more research to establish safe exposure limits for microplastics and to understand the long-term health consequences of exposure. Large-scale studies in humans are needed to determine the relationship between microplastic exposure and the development of chronic diseases. Improved methods for measuring microplastics in living humans are also essential for tracking accumulation and assessing the effectiveness of strategies to reduce exposure. It is also important to research ways to remove plastics from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to wrap our heads around microplastics—rather than wrapping our brains in them—since this could be one of the biggest environmental storms most people never saw coming,” remarked David Puder, host of the Psychiatry &amp;amp; Psychotherapy Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bioaccumulation of microplastics in decedent human brains&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Alexander J.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike standard balance training, which typically focuses on stretches and strengthening practices, vestibular-based exercises are designed to enhance the vestibular system — the sensory system that provides information about body position and a sense of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the small study, which involved 40 middle-stage Parkinson’s patients in Egypt, the individuals receiving such training showed “significant sustained improvements” in an assessment of gait, or manner of walking, over time, the researchers noted. Balance also was significantly improved in the study group “in all test conditions,” according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The findings provide valuable information for healthcare professionals and clinicians involved in the rehabilitation and treatment of patients with [Parkinson’s disease], forming the development of evidence-based interventions and rehabilitation programs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/nri/6846267"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Effect of Vestibular-Oriented Balance Training on Postural Control and Risk of Fall in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology Research International&lt;/em&gt; by a team of scientists from Egypt and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of standard balance training seen only with mild disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s, the loss of nerve cells that produce dopamine, a signaling molecule that helps control movement, leads to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as tremors, rigidity, and stiffness. These symptoms can also contribute to balance issues, increasing the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurodegeneration that underlies Parkinson’s can also affect the vestibular system, the sensory system that provides information about body position. When this system is damaged, a person’s balance, ability to control eye movements when the head is moving, and sense of spatial orientation are all affected. This adds to the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional balance training for Parkinson’s patients typically consists of traditional flexibility, strength, and balance training, including stretches, strengthening exercises using resistance bands in all directions, and rocking from the heels to the toes with and without support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of standard balance training on the risk of falls in Parkinson’s remains inconclusive. Multiple studies show no effect, while others show some benefits — but solely among those with mild disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vestibular-focused training is an alternative approach to balance training that’s designed to improve the workings of this system. It may include interventions to promote hip strategies for balance, step training for fall prevention, and techniques to improve the use of vestibular inputs, such as following a moving target with the eyes while standing still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, according to the team, “more research is needed to identify and establish the essential elements of balance training that can provide more informed guidelines for practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, the researchers — from Cairo University in Giza and the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences in Austin, Texas — conducted a study that evaluated the benefits of vestibular-oriented balance training during the middle stage of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adults in the study, who ranged in age from 67 to 84, were all in the middle stages of Parkinson’s and were on stable therapy. Each was randomly assigned to vestibular-oriented balance training or standard balance training — the latter formed the control group — for eight weeks, or nearly two months. Assessments were conducted at the study’s start, or baseline, before the interventions began, and then at the end of the eight weeks and again at 12 weeks, or a month after the program ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Falls among study group dropped 30% by week 8, were sustained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote hip balance, the vestibular-oriented interventions had patients use an elastic band to resist hip movements while standing on a foam pad, and also take side and forward steps with an ankle weight. For fall prevention, interventions involved forward and side lunges, and tapping the forefoot on an eight-inch step placed on the front and to both sides. Vestibular input exercises included standing still with both eyes tracking a moving target, followed by head turns to the right and left and up and down, and then with eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the eight-week testing period, more patients in the experimental group reported fewer falls than those in the control group. In this period, about 45% of the patients in the experimental group reported at least one fall, compared with 65% of those in the control group. However, these differences were not considered to be statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By week eight, at the end of the training period, the number of falls dropped by 30% in patients in the experimental group — a significant reduction compared with the 5% drop seen in those in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Functional Gait Assessment, or FGA, was used to gauge postural stability and the ability to perform multiple motor tasks during walking. While FGA scores were similar at baseline, they were significantly higher (better) at both eight and 12 weeks with vestibular-focused training compared with standard training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From baseline, patients in the experimental group showed significant sustained improvements in FGA scores over time, while those in the control group had significantly improved at week eight, but didn’t show further improvements at week 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The study suggests that vestibular-oriented balance training could be an effective intervention to improve postural control and decrease the risk of falls in individuals with mild to moderate [Parkinson’s disease]. … [Also, the findings] would suggest that physical therapists may consider intervening earlier in the disease process with balance interventions intended to reduce falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB) assessed an individual’s ability to maintain balance under various sensory conditions. Among them were having one’s eyes open or closed while standing on a stable (rigid) or compliant (soft) surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like FGA scores, the mCTSIB scores significantly improved for patients in the experimental group under all sensory conditions compared with the control group at eight and 12 weeks. Over time, the study group improved significantly in all test conditions, while the control group showed significant improvements solely on stable surfaces with eyes open or closed, without lasting effects at week 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings, the researchers wrote, “would suggest that physical therapists may consider intervening earlier in the disease process with balance interventions intended to reduce falls” among people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vestibular-focused balance training holds promise for preventing falls, particularly under conditions of compromised visual and [sensory] inputs,” the team wrote. “The study suggests that vestibular-oriented balance training could be an effective intervention to improve postural control and decrease the risk of falls in individuals with mild to moderate [Parkinson’s disease].”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe that this is because as one area of the brain deteriorates, other areas of the brain compensate and therefore new skills are unleashed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In PPA, damage occurs to the temporal lobes on either side of the head nearest the ears leading to language problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often begins with behavioral changes, such as starting to carry out actions that are socially inappropriate, apathetic or impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But - unlike in Alzheimer's - patients can still remember recent events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a rare neurological disorder, with just 50,000 Americans living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Sullivan spent nine years working at the El Dorado County Superior Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts at UCSF say Ms Sullivan's case is not unusual, and they have seen a small group of patients with PPA who develop new creative skills in music and art as their language skills decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can manifest itself in multiple ways, and is often either the result of a head injury, a stroke, a tumor or other brain deterioration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Offering an insight as to what the condition is like Darlene Williamson, the president of the National Aphasia Association, previously told DailyMail.com: 'Imagine being dropped in a country where you do not speak the language - cannot understand, read, write or speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It would impact all of your interactions - this is what it is like to have aphasia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other famous examples of aphasia include former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke, who have less severe forms of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are four common types of aphasia that make up a vast majority of cases: fluent - often called Wernicke's; non-fluent - known as Broca's; anomic; and Primary Progressive Aphasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary Progressive Aphasia damages a person's ability to communicate in virtually every single way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person suffering from this version of the condition will have trouble speaking, reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Californian found that she suddenly developed a love of art after her PPA diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors can often detect aphasia via either an MRI or CT scan, and will be able to pinpoint the exact part of the brain that is causing the issue (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their ability to process and understand someone that is speaking to them is damaged as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not always permanent, though, and how long it lasts and how severe it is often depends on how bad the damage to the brain is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors can often detect aphasia via either an MRI or CT scan, and will be able to pinpoint the exact part of the brain that is causing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no way to fix or cure the condition entirely, but patients will often undergo speech therapy to help rebuild their language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's not a lot of progress [with medication for the condition]… the treatment for aphasia is speech therapy,' Dr Brenda Rapp, a cognitive scientist at Johns Hopkins University, told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that in some cases a person may undergo electric stimulation therapy alongside speech therapy in order to 'get the most' out of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Williamson said that 'strong family support is a critical piece of living successfully with aphasia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Ms Sullivan lives alone, she has a Pitbull called Storm to keep her company and she is regularly visited by friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she plans to move into a specialized home next year to get the care she needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To date, she has completed more than 30 artworks and there are talks of them possibly being shown in an exhibition to help raise awareness around aphasia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 16:37:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNU0tNX1gwMjJiXy1RUmVtcVRnS2RQaGJ6U01vcXdFdlhudnFCc2xsdll6SHBZdUdOdjJVOUVXeUM4SnNIQUo3eWpuNUNvdzVhSXdJZjFETzRTNDJPb2twc3ZCcEtXbHV2MWxabXN0Tlptclc3aDlyOGFyajZXSWltUThRQzI0WGRFR3puQnJaWlhzdjNWaEhBQjYyWXZSWGgtbEtrOQ</guid></item><item><title>Top judge's devastating dementia diagnosis unlocked extraordinary superpower in case that stunned doctors -

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe that this is because as one area of the brain deteriorates, other areas of the brain compensate and therefore new skills are unleashed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In PPA, damage occurs to the temporal lobes on either side of the head nearest the ears leading to language problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often begins with behavioral changes, such as starting to carry out actions that are socially inappropriate, apathetic or impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But - unlike in Alzheimer's - patients can still remember recent events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a rare neurological disorder, with just 50,000 Americans living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Sullivan spent nine years working at the El Dorado County Superior Court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts at UCSF say Ms Sullivan's case is not unusual, and they have seen a small group of patients with PPA who develop new creative skills in music and art as their language skills decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can manifest itself in multiple ways, and is often either the result of a head injury, a stroke, a tumor or other brain deterioration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Offering an insight as to what the condition is like Darlene Williamson, the president of the National Aphasia Association, previously told DailyMail.com: 'Imagine being dropped in a country where you do not speak the language - cannot understand, read, write or speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It would impact all of your interactions - this is what it is like to have aphasia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other famous examples of aphasia include former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke, who have less severe forms of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are four common types of aphasia that make up a vast majority of cases: fluent - often called Wernicke's; non-fluent - known as Broca's; anomic; and Primary Progressive Aphasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary Progressive Aphasia damages a person's ability to communicate in virtually every single way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person suffering from this version of the condition will have trouble speaking, reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Californian found that she suddenly developed a love of art after her PPA diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors can often detect aphasia via either an MRI or CT scan, and will be able to pinpoint the exact part of the brain that is causing the issue (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their ability to process and understand someone that is speaking to them is damaged as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not always permanent, though, and how long it lasts and how severe it is often depends on how bad the damage to the brain is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors can often detect aphasia via either an MRI or CT scan, and will be able to pinpoint the exact part of the brain that is causing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no way to fix or cure the condition entirely, but patients will often undergo speech therapy to help rebuild their language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's not a lot of progress [with medication for the condition]… the treatment for aphasia is speech therapy,' Dr Brenda Rapp, a cognitive scientist at Johns Hopkins University, told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that in some cases a person may undergo electric stimulation therapy alongside speech therapy in order to 'get the most' out of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Williamson said that 'strong family support is a critical piece of living successfully with aphasia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Ms Sullivan lives alone, she has a Pitbull called Storm to keep her company and she is regularly visited by friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she plans to move into a specialized home next year to get the care she needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To date, she has completed more than 30 artworks and there are talks of them possibly being shown in an exhibition to help raise awareness around aphasia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 16:37:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNU0tNX1gwMjJiXy1RUmVtcVRnS2RQaGJ6U01vcXdFdlhudnFCc2xsdll6SHBZdUdOdjJVOUVXeUM4SnNIQUo3eWpuNUNvdzVhSXdJZjFETzRTNDJPb2twc3ZCcEtXbHV2MWxabXN0Tlptclc3aDlyOGFyajZXSWltUThRQzI0WGRFR3puQnJaWlhzdjNWaEhBQjYyWXZSWGgtbEtrOdIBqgFBVV95cUxNS1dJWXM5QmR6aUhOTVlQczZyWGNTaGJkbTlyaHB6VUFESFNINjJaRG5WWXlSYV8zSV8wMUdUNjdKM1ZhbnZVT2VpeS04Qkg5dmZmMHotTVN6aUhQck1kdVdUdDdYeFJhek1uVWNDc0FlV2s2anc1YVJsYTFuUXcwZXFZdTM0UVZJdExxd1lYOW1zNmd4RVB0dmdzSUdqbVRpVUg4STQ1S0tmZw</guid></item><item><title>Warning as horrified gym-goer is diagnosed with contagious infection that left her oozing with blood after han -

	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
				
&lt;p&gt;A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in a backyard flock in Dawson County, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). This marks the fourth confirmed case of HPAI in Nebraska backyard flocks in 2025, affecting approximately 219 birds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley urged poultry producers to implement strong biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. He advised limiting exposure to wild birds and practicing hygiene measures such as washing hands and changing clothes, including shoes, before and after handling poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPAI is a highly contagious virus that spreads among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as contaminated food, water, and manure. It can be transmitted through direct contact with infected birds, exposure to contaminated equipment, and even on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. Wild birds can carry the virus without symptoms, but domesticated birds often become severely ill and may die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of HPAI in poultry include decreased water consumption, loss of energy and appetite, reduced egg production, respiratory issues, and diarrhea. The virus can also cause sudden death in birds, even if they show no prior symptoms. It can persist in contaminated environments for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poultry producers are encouraged to monitor their flocks and report any signs of HPAI or unusual deaths to the NDA.&lt;/p&gt;

Some patients have runny or stuffy noses and sore throats, and some people experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;More severe illness includes difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, seizures and what the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; “altered consciousness” – all signs that a patient should go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Very red or irritated eyes (known as conjunctivitis or “pink eye”) have also been a common symptom in this outbreak, and are not a typical flu symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-many-people-have-died-from-bird-flu" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How many people have died from bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Since 2003, there have been more than 950 reported cases of H5N1 globally, and &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_149#:~:text=Globally%2C%20from%201%20January%202003,fatal%20(CFR%20of%2049%25)." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;49%&lt;/a&gt; of patients have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the US outbreak, the mortality rate has been much lower so far. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;70&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases, and several more probable cases, in the past year. One person has died, and three others have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s possible the mortality rate is lower because the cases detected in this outbreak have been less severe. But the mortality rate is still significantly high in cases that are bad enough to need hospital care, said Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In countries with poor access to healthcare, the mortality rate may be higher because sick patients aren’t able to get care that could save their lives, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The virus can be really nasty for some people,” said Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and dean of the Yale School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We don’t know yet what puts someone at risk of getting really sick, Ranney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Flu viruses mutate and evolve quickly. If bird flu begins spreading between humans, there could be changes in how it sickens people, she added. “There’s really no way for me to say, if it becomes a pandemic, that we’re going to have the same case fatality ratio that we’re seeing right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-bird-flu-spread-to-humans" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does bird flu spread to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bird flu spreads through contact with animals and unpasteurized animal products. That means the people who are most at risk are those who care for chickens and dairy cattle, those who come into contact with wild birds and animals, and anyone drinking raw milk or eating undercooked meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There have also been two US cases, in California and Missouri, where patients got sick with H5N1 with no known contact with animals or raw food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There has been no documented transmission between humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, details about the outbreak have been scarce in the past month especially, starting with a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/musk-doge-bird-flu-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;communications blackout at health agencies&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not clear if new patterns of transmission have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re missing opportunities to learn more about this virus and the risk that it poses to people and our economy,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. “But also, we’re missing the opportunity to possibly discover something that would make us worry less about the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-treatment-for-bird-flu" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the treatment for bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Flu antivirals like Tamiflu seem to work against bird flu by reducing the severity of illness and possibly keeping patients from transmitting it to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But Tamiflu needs to be given soon after illness starts. And scientists recently &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2469643?src=exp-la" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a strain that could demonstrate some resistance to antivirals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-33" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But we don’t use them yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Some of the shots for people have been licensed for use in the US, while others are still awaiting approval. The US government has stockpiled 4.8m doses of H5N1 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/bird-flu-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;none of them&lt;/a&gt; are available to the public. The reasons why are complicated: there have been few hospitalizations and deaths in the US, there isn’t evidence of person-to-person transmission, and officials worry about hesitation over a new vaccine, Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/bird-flu-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Experts say the vaccine should be made available to farm workers, veterinarians and other people at risk. “This is a recurring occupational hazard,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are also vaccines for poultry, and scientists are working on a cow vaccine as well. But none of these have been given to animals yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-the-seasonal-flu-shot-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Does the seasonal flu shot help?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You should get the seasonal flu vaccine to protect you from seasonal flu,” Davis said. Another reason is that in rare cases when someone catches H5N1, they might catch the seasonal flu at the same time – and the two variants could mix together in a process called reassortment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This could cause H5N1 to become more easily transmissible or cause more severe disease, suggested Davis. “Brand-new viruses that can transmit easily are the ones that tend to cause epidemics or pandemics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Fewer cases of seasonal flu takes pressure off the healthcare system during flu season, and makes it easier for doctors and health departments to identify rare infections like H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-bird-flu-going-to-get-worse" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is bird flu going to get worse?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Any hopes that the current outbreak would simply pass through “have been dashed”, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We have to be looking ahead to what would happen if this virus began spreading more easily between people,” Nuzzo has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/15/biden-administration-bird-flu-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “If it could spread easily between people, we would be in a pandemic, and it would be around the globe in a matter of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Experts expect another flu pandemic at some point. It might not be H5N1 – it might be a combination of H5N1 and a different flu variant, or a different type altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That means it’s important to prepare vaccines, treatments and tests, and to strengthen healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-get-a-test-for-bird-flu" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Can I get a test for bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yes. Your doctor can order an H5N1 test for you at commercial laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s important to let your doctor know why you think you might have bird flu – for instance, if you work closely with animals or consume raw milk, meat or eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It will help the health authorities to get things in the queue much faster for further testing,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-there-a-risk-of-bird-flu-from-raw-milk-eggs-or-meat" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is there a risk of bird flu from raw milk, eggs or meat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Raw milk can contain enormous quantities of virus. While no cases have been reported yet in humans from drinking raw milk, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/cats-bird-flu" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sickened&lt;/a&gt; and killed mammals such as cats – so officials strongly recommend against it for people, as well. Pasteurization (boiling milk for a certain amount of time) kills the virus and makes milk safe to drink. Eggs and meat should be cooked fully to kill all pathogens, including bird flu, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/egg-guidance-regulation-and-other-information/questions-and-answers-regarding-safety-eggs-during-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-outbreaks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Davis recommended “good hygiene practices writ large in the kitchen,” such as washing your hands after handling raw eggs or meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s illegal for sick animals to enter the food chain, but US officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/usda-dairy-cows-bird-flu-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; bird flu in meat from dairy cows intended for slaughter. It’s important to cook meat to an internal temperature of at least 145F/63C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There are many, many, many different pathogens that you can get exposed to from these sources,” Davis said, such as campylobacter, cryptosporidium, &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;, listeria and salmonella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 16:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE13NlhXTjY1U0xrT01FZ0p0R1hKME1mTlBrZkZLRTRHNWxGd2tLalZ4djhrYVBZdXNQRkszLUR3akszY0pTbGxuZVREcktoWVdPYVFUWlIzbnc4eU94MkZVWmx5ZUFLZVdpYldLdGE3XzZHdUdkaUE</guid></item><item><title>Louisiana kindergarten vaccination rates decline.

&lt;p&gt;In order to go to school, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-PH/immunizations/2023-2024-Immunization_Guide_for_Louisiana_Schools.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana requires&lt;/a&gt; four doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine (DTaP); three doses of the polio vaccine, two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR); three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine (HepB); two doses of the hepatitis A vaccine (HepA); and two doses of the varicella vaccine (chickenpox or Var). &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p1123-measles-threat.html" target="_blank"&gt;a 95% measles vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for schools in order to reach "herd immunity" — when enough of the population is immune to the disease to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says the rate of vaccinations needed for herd immunity depends on the disease:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccination rate of whooping cough (pertussis) should be &lt;strong&gt;above 90%&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7999208/#:~:text=Herd%20immunity%20against%20pertussis%20agents,in%20all%20countries%20and%20regions" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccination rate of polio should be &lt;strong&gt;at least 80%&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccination rate for hepatitis A and hepatitis B should be &lt;strong&gt;at least 80%&lt;/strong&gt; to trigger herd immunity, according to the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/78/4/976/7280117" target="_blank"&gt;Oxford Academic Journal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Chia seeds, which hail from Central America, have been highly regarded for their nutritional value for thousands of years. According to Healthline, an ounce of chia seeds has almost five grams of protein, ten grams of fiber, and a surprising amount of calcium, iron, and B vitamins for their size. These nutrients, along with their high amount of antioxidants, make chia seeds a healthy choice that can help people lose weight, lower their blood sugar, and even avoid heart disease. Chia seeds are incredibly versatile, and there are dozens of ways to start eating more of them — all you need to do is add them to things you already eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the main things stopping people from eating the way they want to is convenience. Chia seeds can be used for everything, from baking bread to binding hamburger meat. They can even be &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1544935/chia-flax-seeds-egg-substitute/" target="_blank"&gt;used as an emergency egg substitute&lt;/a&gt;! While not everyone has the time to utilize chia seeds in such an involved way, luckily, they can be added to an endless number of dishes with little to no effort from the chef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One way that you can enjoy the benefits of chia seeds throughout the day is by simply adding them to your beverages like water, juice, and tea. All you need to do is let the dry seeds soak for a bit in your drink before you imbibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For instance, to make a liter of chia water, soak a quarter cup of seeds in the liquid for half an hour. Or, for a sweeter sip, use the same ratio to make a few days' worth of chia juice. And if you don't want to prepare your drinks in bulk, a teaspoon of seeds is enough to upgrade any single serving of a beverage.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While it's not a good idea to eat too many plain, dry chia seeds by themselves (their absorbent properties can mean trouble for your tummy), using them as a topping for tasty treats is a healthy and delicious way to get more chia into your diet. Yogurt is a classic vessel for raw chia seeds, but they're also great mixed into your popcorn or sprinkled over ice cream. Whole chia seeds are quite hard, so if you prefer a less crunchy topping, opt for ground chia. You can grind the seeds yourself with a spice grinder or food processor, or simply buy a bag of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spectrum-Essentials-Organic-Ground-Seeds/dp/B0083COR56/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ADuBn4m1zOWXmY20ghYrLqHyqMSgId3Xi5tWedmbr-bAdCncre1JLpD9tbMgNz3tAOuTVR5nYZ46qNy7oYnTO5_qlPVU8vCiz-ECFDqum7e2Jm4pG_Gb8_rYpDnfTG2aGjwOh48J828p7y-qvUFMbPHh13yURmbaG5XRej5no-Q51GAG8YuDnEPL0wSi4ppj_e3YvWU3SkSJTU2OGetZAy3cqZEaliyULpkuyw1KnRtFKDZtmKMFOi9BAnq8Ml6R9aEuWaAPZ8Ub7LMbrOCxpJnJWSHm-cLSmoMsfEyuHD9ENje7dhqzhZuK8wwui4XO22dpwLzy6IDR_nA9bR96HoB8FM_AJdRNcYlUJYqhXtNYvG28W5pSY90C1ZfKdODOf8am7YqhFcH15TvUtJYoTPqvhUZ0utuuAX7-fIIB_Qi5xF5KMdiaDguvGH91I6BM.glaWYHLQ2d5fr4NDGTe40ECh-3PafBKS_ZtrOqpcxZ0&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=ground%20chia%20seed&amp;amp;qid=1740700588&amp;amp;sr=8-5&amp;amp;tag=staticmedia-chowhound-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;pre-ground chia seeds from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the trendiest ways to eat chia seeds is by making chia pudding. Throwing this yummy snack together will require very little effort on your part as long as you plan ahead. Simply combine a cup of your preferred type of milk with a quarter cup of chia seeds in an airtight container and mix everything together. Then, let it sit in the refrigerator for at least eight hours before digging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Chia pudding has a creamy, neutral flavor that can be endlessly customized with other ingredients like maple syrup, honey, vanilla, fruit, and cinnamon. You can even add some dry chia seeds for a bit of crunch.

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Chia seeds may be most commonly used in sweeter dishes, but they make an excellent addition to savory fare as well. The slightly nutty flavor of chia seeds is perfect for adding a bit of depth (and some crunchy texture) to dishes like a stir fry or fried rice. Or, take the nutritional value of your salads to the next level by finishing them with some seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dry chia seeds can also be used to easily thicken runny soups, sauces, or gravy. Just let the seeds sit in the liquid for a few minutes while you prepare the rest of your meal, and the final result should be a complete upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mixing some nutrient-packed chia seeds into your breakfast is the perfect way to start the day. Blend chia gel or seeds into a smoothie for a natural protein boost, or dust a spoonful of ground chia over your oatmeal; you could also add them to an overnight oats recipe, like this one for &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1678372/matcha-almond-overnight-oats-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;matcha almond overnight oats&lt;/a&gt;. Since chia seeds can be added to practically any liquid (within reason), you could also soak them in a jar of your favorite jam or preserves to pack your sweet spreads with some extra vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/article&gt;

Well, according to the experts at &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.webmd.com/sex/stop-having-sex-health"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;, quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;There are a number of health benefits associated with having sex (Studio4 / Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Anxiety and stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Up first on the rundown is your &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;During sex, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/science"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; like oxytocin, dopamine and endorphins - AKA 'feel good hormones - are released and these can help you manage the effects of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Additionally, the former, which is also referred to as the 'love hormone' has an added benefit of helping you get to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/sleep"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Relationship health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Not only do all three chemicals help reduce stress, but they aid in boosting your mood and deepening emotional intimacy with your partner - both of which contribute to better mental health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For example, if you found you and your partner were previously having a noticeable amount more sex than you are now, then it could make you feel less connected to one another which could raise stress and anxiety around the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Obviously, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; can also just get in the way sometimes with busy schedules, family issues and work drama too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Sex can help boost emotional intimacy with your partner (filadendron / Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Sex can apparently seriously boost your immune system by increasing the production of antibodies that protect against &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life/bacterial-vaginosis-bv-symptoms-sti-explained-326092-20250307"&gt;infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This means you could experience less common colds and other similar illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to the experts, one of the best things you can do for your immune system is to get enough quality sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And, because sex is linked to better sleep, having it regularly can help strengthen your overall immune health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menstrual health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you find you get seriously bad cramps during your &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/health"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;, then sex may help alleviate some of the discomfort - however, this isn't the case for every person who bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The science behind it follows the reason behind why we even get cramps in the first place: because our uterus contracts to shed its lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Orgasms can also cause contractions in the uterine muscle which are usually followed by a big release that can ease tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While period sex may not be for everyone, it's sounds like a pretty great &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life-hacks"&gt;life hack&lt;/a&gt; if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Some people find that sex helps alleviate their period cramps!

(Ogawa received research support and lecture fees from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sumitomo-pharma.com/news/20100422.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sumitomo-pharma.com/news/20100422.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;metformin manufacturer Sumitomo Pharma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Ogawa's team showed that the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14262" target="_blank" data-url="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14262" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;body excretes glucose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into the hollow tunnel of the human gut where food and waste travel, known as the lumen. This happens in people with and without diabetes. "It means that this is a physiological function that humans have," Ogawa told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rhn88Hmv9nojSVPMZSBHv" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rhn88Hmv9nojSVPMZSBHv slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/ozempic-style-drugs-tied-to-more-than-60-health-benefits-and-risks-in-biggest-study-of-its-kind" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/ozempic-style-drugs-tied-to-more-than-60-health-benefits-and-risks-in-biggest-study-of-its-kind"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic-style drugs tied to more than 60 health benefits and risks in biggest study-of-its-kind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="feeding-gut-bacteria-3"&gt;Feeding gut bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers found that metformin nearly quadrupled the rate of glucose excretion into the gut in five people with type 2 diabetes, and they replicated those findings in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping glucose out of circulation by directing it to the gut might directly lower blood sugar levels, but scientists told Live Science they think this explains only part of metformin’s therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/nicola-morrice" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/people/nicola-morrice" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicola Morrice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a metformin researcher at the University of Dundee in Scotland who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email, "I do not expect this to be the drug's main mechanism of action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides drawing sugar out of the bloodstream, excreted glucose could also have an indirect effect on blood sugar by feeding gut bacteria, other experts told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.udg.edu/en/directori/pagina-personal?om=PR&amp;amp;ID=53221&amp;amp;language=en-US" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.udg.edu/en/directori/pagina-personal?om=PR&amp;amp;ID=53221&amp;amp;language=en-US" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. José-Manuel Fernández-Real&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical researcher at the University of Girona in Spain who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email, "Some bacteria, particularly those that thrive on simple sugars, may experience increased growth, while others that rely on complex carbohydrates or fiber fermentation might be less affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A glucose molecule has a backbone of six carbon atoms, so to determine the rate at which gut bacteria break down glucose into other molecules, Ogawa had to find a way to keep track of these carbons. His team injected mice with glucose containing a "heavy" isotope, meaning a version of carbon that carries an extra neutron. This allowed them to trace the heavy carbons as the bacteria transformed glucose into other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stool samples revealed that bacteria in mice treated with metformin had converted the heavy glucose into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). "Bacterial species that produce short chain fatty acids are generally 'good' bacteria," suggesting metformin’s effects could potentially foster a healthy microbiome, Ogawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin treatment caused SCFAs containing heavy carbon to increase by just 1% in stool samples. However, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.irsjd.org/en/people/staff/146/manuel-vazquez-carrera" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.irsjd.org/en/people/staff/146/manuel-vazquez-carrera" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Manuel Vázquez-Carrera&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pharmacology researcher at the University of Barcelona who was not involved with the study, told Live Science in an email that "most SCFAs are rapidly absorbed and utilized rather than excreted." That means the measurement was likely an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And "even a slight rise in SCFA production could enhance gut barrier function, reduce inflammation, and improve insulin sensitivity, all of which are beneficial for managing diabetes," Fernández-Real speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had a few limitations. First, the researchers did not assess how higher levels of gut SCFAs affected the health of the mice. It also included "a very small number of participants who were receiving varying doses of metformin as part of their treatment regimes," Morrice said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse work also involved only male rodents, so &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/lets-just-study-males-and-keep-it-simple-how-excluding-female-animals-from-research-held-neuroscience-back-and-could-do-so-again" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/lets-just-study-males-and-keep-it-simple-how-excluding-female-animals-from-research-held-neuroscience-back-and-could-do-so-again"&gt;&lt;u&gt;possible sex differences in the drug's actions were not explored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond testing metformin's effects on five diabetes patients, Ogawa said he has finished a larger, gold-standard trial in humans to further study the drug's impacts on the gut. The researchers haven't completed the analysis, but as of yet, they haven't seen any sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrice suggested that future work could explore how metformin affects glucose excretion in mice that consume different diets, such as high-fat, high-sugar diets, which are linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-rhn88Hmv9nojSVPMZSBHv-B99JK5DLXFUsTq8Z4z6qwA0wXTzXd5UN" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-rhn88Hmv9nojSVPMZSBHv-B99JK5DLXFUsTq8Z4z6qwA0wXTzXd5UN slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
