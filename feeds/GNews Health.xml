Apart from a large spike in 2017 and 2018, this is the largest number of yellow fever cases for any year in the continent, bar one, since 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The current wave of yellow fever, which can cause fever, nausea and even organ failure, comes on the back of one of Brazil’s worst ever years for dengue. In 2024, nearly 6.5m cases of dengue and about 5,000 deaths were &lt;a href="https://www.dengue.com/Dengue-outbreak-in-Brazil-2024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil. Last year was also a startling record year for dengue in &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/dengue-monthly" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, with 304 reported cases – more than the 275 cases reported in the previous 15 years combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d8899c3f-0552-4c1c-83aa-8524f9e85d8d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Major US broadcasters sit out Cop30 climate talks: ‘They’re missing a lot’","elementId":"d8899c3f-0552-4c1c-83aa-8524f9e85d8d","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/cop30-climate-talks-belem-us-broadcasters"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both yellow fever and dengue are transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquito, which thrive in warm conditions and stagnant water. The climate crisis, which is raising global temperatures and causing more ferocious rainfall, is aggravating around half of known human pathogenic diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01426-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists have determined&lt;/a&gt;, as disease-carrying mosquitoes expand their range across a rapidly heating world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The sharp increase in transmitted diseases in the Amazon region comes as UN climate talks take place in Belém, a Brazilian city that sits near the mouth of the Amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health was, until a few years ago, a largely overlooked area of the climate crisis in these annual summits but the UN declared Thursday “health day” at Cop30 and promoted a new plan to help countries deal with the array of illnesses and life-threatening conditions spurred by a hotter world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Across the world, people are living the daily reality that the climate crisis is also a public health crisis,” said Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief. “Rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and storms are claiming lives, fueling diseases and malnutrition, and placing immense pressure on health systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="29678ce3-7714-45e5-b089-630587cee50c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Children wear masks for a vaccination campaign against whooping cough and yellow fever on 08 May 2025 in Quito, Ecuador. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Agencia Press South/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stiell said the new &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/climate-change/en---belem-action-plan.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Belém Health Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;, led by Brazil’s government and the World Health Organization, will help countries with surveillance, best practices and capacity building to help them deal with climate-fueled health issues. A coalition of 35 philanthropic bodies has pledged $300m in funding for the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Humanity can only win this global climate fight if we connect stronger climate actions to people’s top priorities in their daily lives,” Stiell said. “And there are few higher priorities than our health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But climate advocates and health experts say much more will need to be done to deal with the fallout from scorching temperatures and worsening disasters such as flooding. On Wednesday, Al Gore, the former US vice-president, said that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/29/rising-heat-kills-one-person-a-minute-worldwide-lancet-countdown" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent evidence &lt;/a&gt;that rising heat is killing one person a minute worldwide shows that governments are badly failing to curb the direct human harm of the climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How long are we going to stand by … keep turning the thermostat up so that these sort of events get even worse? Gore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Health experts said that several factors are causing the expansion of infectious diseases, such as the razing of forests for agriculture and housing, which is bringing humans closer to animals that can spread zoonotic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s globalization as well and it’s also the fact that mosquitoes are smart and so are bacteria,” said Maria Guevara, the international medical secretary of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, who is at the Belem gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“And whether it’s bacteria or viruses, they transmit, they’re just smarter than humans in that case because they’re more adapted, and they will adapt to survive. We are much too slow. We know what we need to do about climate change, but we’re not doing anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Guevara said much more will need to be done to equip countries that are having outbreaks of disease worsened by the extreme weather. MSF has in recent years had to respond to outbreaks of yellow fever in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the wake of severe droughts or floods. Distribution of vaccines can be difficult even in countries like Brazil, where yellow fever inoculations are free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’ve had huge outbreaks of dengue and an increase in yellow fever even outside of the Amazon region because of lots of rain and high temperatures, which makes the mosquitoes bite more and affects the reproduction of virus in the mosquitoes,” said Rachel Vicente, an &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r1796" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expert&lt;/a&gt; at the health sciences center at Brazil’s Federal University of Espírito Santo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People are living near more breeding sites, too, especially in urban areas of Brazil. It’s a perfect storm and it’s not just a problem of tropical areas any more, we’ve had outbreaks in Europe because it is getting warmer there and is becoming easier for the vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all need to collaborate more on resilience because all countries will need to prepare for this now, not just some of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOSlBweXhneHUtRi1neWdNTFdEYW9zdnk5ZlR2eGlPNlEyQUhzUWFfZXNxT1YtZVY5WWhZTHowRS1rYVVTdk5uUkJCNHlqdVJSX09nNGYyejZaZzNvUGRCUVRQMnI0Sk4wdG1JZHFGLUNhNnNnOU1pSURTMVFRUWFQRFRGRjZPRVRnN3NhVjVWcEVzRThiUGJCZw</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic for All ？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/podcasts/the-daily/ozempic-price-deal-novo-nordisk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPcHctMkl0QS1KOW5LbnN2UWNYQnREdmxNVWk3NlFMaEEyanhPY3pWNGFibVZrcDh1dHh4NzZoSGxjdFRsSldrYl9xUzQ3ZHoyRWQzX2VfY3hFZFBUM1NBdXhXaGxzeUl1V3FoV3FlV1NyT1A4eW5KTkxYX2ZvSW9wTXo4U2g1VkhTclZuSkRZUHpFZ1E1</guid></item><item><title>越来越多的人拒绝为宠物接种疫苗。他们有一个令人难以置信的原因。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/life/2025/11/animal-pet-autism-vaccine-covid-rfk-jr.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwg992q005jmemby174a0le@published"&gt;About eight years ago, Grant decided he would never vaccinate his dogs again. A former Army medic, the Santa Barbara, California, resident had always given his pets whatever the veterinarian recommended, including shots for rabies and parvo. But after training as a bodyworker and practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine, he started to question the utility of the preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxh001h3b78mcr8slo8@published"&gt;Influenced by the tenets of TCM and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/books/experiments-in-deceit.html"&gt;a book he read&lt;/a&gt; on the unethical practices of rabies vaccine pioneer Louis Pasteur, Grant became skeptical that the collection of symptoms identified by veterinarians as &lt;em&gt;rabies&lt;/em&gt; was an actual, distinct disease that could be targeted by an injectable drug. Though he distrusts pharmaceutical products, potential adverse effects aren’t his major objection to the shots. “It’s more about not being convinced at all that there’s really anything to vaccinate &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001i3b78ezluwayf@published"&gt;Though health authorities adamantly agree that rabies is a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies"&gt;real virus&lt;/a&gt;, Grant is far from alone in his skepticism about vaccines. In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23010150"&gt;2023 survey&lt;/a&gt; of American dog owners published in the journal Vaccine, 30 percent deemed dog vaccines medically unnecessary, 22 percent called them ineffective, and 37 percent worried that they could cause autism in their pets. A small majority expressed at least one of these three positions, exhibiting what the researchers called a &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2023/nearly-half-of-dog-owners-are-hesitant-to-vaccinate-their-pets/"&gt;concerning degree&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001j3b78uf2enypr@published"&gt;Studies and anecdotal reports have documented vaccine skepticism among pet owners around the world for years. In 2017, a &lt;a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/not-a-shot-anti-vax-movement-prompts-brooklynites-to-withhold-inoculations-from-their-pets-vets-say/"&gt;Brooklyn Paper article&lt;/a&gt; declared that veterinarians in the New York borough were hearing clients express concerns about routine shots. According to &lt;a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/7420/2019-paw-report_downloadable.pdf"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from an animal welfare organization in the U.K., just 66 percent of cat, dog, and rabbit owners said in 2019 that their pet was vaccinated while young, compared to 84 percent in 2016. Veterinarians &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-03-01/vaccine-hesitancy"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine-hesitant pet owners have good intentions and only want their pets to be well; the American Veterinary Medical Association, which did not return a request for comment, has published &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/vaccine-hesitancy-gives-some-us-dog-cat-owners-cold-feet"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; for vets who must promote vaccination to skeptical clients.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001k3b78dszbvxbm@published"&gt;But opposition to pet vaccines seems to have risen since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that since contemporary pet owners view their animal companions as family members, attitudes toward veterinary treatments &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/04/30/veterinarians-want-you-to-know-vaccines-will-not-give-your-dog-autism/"&gt;mirror&lt;/a&gt; attitudes toward human medical interventions. The Vaccine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journal study found that people with negative views of human vaccines were likelier to have negative opinions of animal vaccines—and COVID-19 had a lasting impact on the way people feel about preventative shots. In a series of Gallup polls, the percentage of Americans who said it was extremely or very important for parents to vaccinate their children &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;dropped 15 points&lt;/a&gt; between 2020 and 2024, a decline the poll attributed almost entirely to right-leaning Americans. A survey conducted in Brazil found that pet owners were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016758772300257X"&gt;six times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to refrain from vaccinating their animals if they themselves were not fully vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001l3b78e173rzpt@published"&gt;Anti-vaccine advocates save their strongest rebukes for mRNA pet vaccines, the first of which were approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/blog/2024/06/25/usda-approval-nobivac-nxt-civ/"&gt;canine influenza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/blog/2024/09/24/usda-approval-nobivac-nxt-felv/"&gt;feline leukemia&lt;/a&gt; last year. The menu of veterinary mRNA vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.aaha.org/trends-magazine/publications/rna-vaccines-the-way-of-the-future/"&gt;may soon expand&lt;/a&gt;; in Canada, pets can already get one for rabies. Because the two most famous and effective COVID-19 vaccines—Pfizer’s and Moderna’s—were the first-ever mRNA products to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, mRNA technology has become a primary villain of the anti-vaccine movement in both human and animal medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001m3b78e7u09p3r@published"&gt;Just as the alleged connection between human vaccines and autism has been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/"&gt;thoroughly, repeatedly debunked&lt;/a&gt;, there is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/world/europe/britain-dogs-autism-vaccine.html"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that pet vaccines are responsible for the ills with which anti-vaccine advocates credit them, from early-onset cancers to a suite of cognitive and behavioral problems that some half-jokingly call “pawtism.” Like autism in humans, “pawtism” is allegedly characterized by repetitive behaviors, sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and difficulty in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001n3b78350zjtqx@published"&gt;The lack of scientific backing for these vaccine concerns hasn’t stopped a multitude of influencers, care providers, and activists from raising alarm about veterinary shots. There are peddlers of tonics that claim to heal pets from the effects of “&lt;a href="https://shoprawdogfood.rawdogfoodandco.com/products/detox-bundle"&gt;toxic preventatives and pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;.” There are podcasters trumpeting “&lt;a href="https://angelaardolino.com/over-vaccination-with-dr-jeff-grognet/"&gt;the risks of over-vaccination&lt;/a&gt;.” There are social media personalities posting scary videos about pet vaccines “&lt;a href="https://x.com/ValerieAnne1970/status/1956627314965348531"&gt;shedding&lt;/a&gt;” onto humans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxl001o3b788imudhey@published"&gt;Among conventional veterinarians, there is no recognized diagnosis of animal autism. But some alternative practitioners insist that it is a real condition, sometimes caused by vaccines. Caroline Wilkinson, a dog trainer in the U.K., said she first learned about the possibility through the teachings of a holistic veterinarian. (Wilkinson is not a veterinarian.) She became convinced that it was a real phenomenon after seeing an increase in “fear-based behaviors” among puppies after their first shots, which she claims to have reversed with essential oil therapy. “It could be argued that these fear-based behaviors came as part of the developmental stages of puppyhood,” she said—but the speed with which the puppies recovered “indicates to me that the chemical load of the vaccine was responsible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001p3b78gd3p9rv4@published"&gt;Many of the people and organizations decrying pet vaccines are the same ones fueling skepticism of human vaccines. Children’s Health Defense, a prominent anti-vaccine advocacy group founded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Miracles-Everywhere-Unorthodox-Veterinary/dp/1510782028?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; last year about “the dangers of over-vaccination” in veterinary medicine. &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1915450267170201852"&gt;A recent video&lt;/a&gt; posted by the organization featured holistic veterinarian &lt;a href="https://ahavet.com/"&gt;Judy Jasek&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed that the “toxicity” of vaccines is causing cancer in young pets. “We know they’re not testing this stuff,” she said in the video, calling the vaccine manufacturers “the same big pharmaceutical companies that are doing their shenanigans with people.” (While shots can, on &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/pet-owners/petcare/vaccines-and-sarcomas-concern-cat-owners"&gt;rare occasions&lt;/a&gt;, cause tumors at the injection site in cats, there is no evidence that vaccines are responsible for other types of pet cancers.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001q3b78ixlbah59@published"&gt;Jasek, who sees clients via telemedicine from her base in Tennessee, told me she started her career as a conventional veterinarian. About a decade into her practice, she began having doubts that the vaccines she delivered to animals were safe or necessary. Her suspicions were not based on any available medical literature. “Is there a formal, quote-unquote ‘research study’? No,” she said in an interview. “Nobody’s going to do research that shows that vaccines are toxic and bad, because there’s so much money made in the vaccine industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001r3b78wwsuinsh@published"&gt;Instead, Jasek drew her conclusions from her own observations and discussions with other “holistically-minded” colleagues. She decided to transition to a different kind of veterinary practice, replacing pharmaceutical products with herbs and homeopathic remedies. She counseled her clients on vaccinating their pets less, if at all. But “rabies is really hard to get around, because of the laws,” she said. The rabies vaccine is legally required for domestic canines in &lt;a href="https://www.animallaw.info/content/rabies-vaccination-and-exemption-laws-dogs"&gt;most U.S. states&lt;/a&gt;, including Colorado, where Jasek was practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001s3b789vdjdzq3@published"&gt;Like more than a dozen other states, Colorado offered a loophole for medical exemptions. If she could argue that a pet was not healthy in any way, Jasek would write up a note excusing the animal from the rabies vaccine. Most of the time it worked fine, but she says she was twice contacted by the state board because people had filed complaints against her. (The complaints never led to any disciplinary proceedings.) Once, it was another veterinarian who didn’t believe an exemption was justified. Another time, a client’s unvaccinated dog bit someone.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001t3b7884s15ay7@published"&gt;“She kind of threw me under the bus, basically, and said, ‘Well, Dr. Judy said I don’t need the vaccines,’ ” Jasek told me. “That isn’t true. I mean, I tell people that the vaccines can cause health concerns. However, when it comes to the laws and the rules, people still have to be accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001u3b78s6dxm8a0@published"&gt;Rabies outbreaks in wildlife populations are &lt;a href="https://beaconbio.org/en/report/?reportid=228441a4-540b-4c15-84ec-ec8df7c569cd&amp;amp;eventid=1a182de8-04e5-450c-8d66-5dc49010b31e"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S., due in part to human incursion on natural habitats. Though the people who have died from rabies exposure in the last year have gotten the disease from wild animals, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rabies-outbreaks-rising-us-deaths-vaccine-rcna227771"&gt;veterinarians worry&lt;/a&gt; that distrust of pet vaccinations could lead to a resurgence among domestic animals of a virus that is nearly 100 percent fatal in both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwgbsxm001v3b78v07jx8eg@published"&gt;People whose pets aren’t vaccinated for rabies may have difficulty finding a groomer or a place to board their dogs and cats, and they won’t be able to take international flights with their pets. Grant can’t license his dogs, as Santa Barbara regulations require, because one has never been vaccinated and the other hasn’t had one since his initial puppy shots. (For this reason, Grant requested a pseudonym as a condition of our interview.) “As a practitioner myself, boy, it would sure be nice if local and state and federal governments would force people by law to consume my product,” he said. Rabies vaccine mandates are “kind of the definition of fascism, where government and corporations have merged, and now it’s claimed that it’s science—it’s scientific, so therefore it’s public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

He handles their medical care himself, using natural products and bodywork techniques. Recently, hoping to rid Grant’s dog Pilgrim (also a pseudonym) of a flea problem, a family member gave Pilgrim a pharmaceutical flea medication. According to Grant, the drug knocked Pilgrim out for the better part of four days. Grant massaged the muscles around his vital organs, which seemed to help Pilgrim regain the ability to stand up and urinate. As for the fleas, Grant will stick to using natural shampoos and brushing Pilgrim more often, even if it’s a partial, temporary fix. And he’ll take his chances without vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3pyzb7001w26oz4vo59xk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Carol Saffran started taking Ozempic a year ago to regulate her blood sugar after other medications were ineffective. She was prediabetic, a condition in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal, and her doctor prescribed Ozempic to help her avoid developing diabetes. She’s now close to her ideal body weight and has an appointment soon to check her progress in lowering her blood sugar – but after moving up to the highest dose of Ozempic, she started noticing something else.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfegob700023b6n0j205utw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would brush my hair and look at my hairbrush, and there was just a little bit more [hair] than normal,” said Saffran, 71, of the greater Boston area. “It’s not coming out in clumps or anything like that, but it’s definitely not as dense as it used to be. It just feels thinner. My hair is not as full as it used to be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfegob700043b6nrrnjwufl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A hair loss specialist at Tufts Medical Center, Dr. Farah Moustafa, director of laser and cosmetics,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosed Saffran with telogen effluvium: hair loss due to stress on the body. In Saffran’s case, that stress was the significant weight loss she experienced since being on Ozempic, Moustafa said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhxwvtwr00003b6qop8n1dny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medicines have surged in popularity in recent years. A poll released Friday by KFF found that about 1 in 8 adults say they are currently taking a GLP-1 drug to treat a chronic disease, for weight loss or both — an increase of 6% since May 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhxxc5fz00093b6qex3df5e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, side effects remain a key reason why some people decide to stop taking them. Hair loss is less common than well-known side effects such as nausea, vomiting or constipation, but it’s often discussed in online weight loss groups and among friends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3pznud00003b6n8uxk68kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are four phases of hair growth. The first is the anagen or growth phase. It’s followed by the catagen or transitional phase, the telogen or  resting phase and then the exogen or shedding phase. Normally, anagen is the longest phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhm86fwe00113b6nrykigm0w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Telogen effluvium is a condition that pushes an abnormal amount of hair follicles into the telogen phase, leading to more shedding than usual.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800153b6nqzonah2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said telogen effluvium often appears after a period of stress, such as childbirth, anesthesia or crash dieting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800133b6na7eu54c9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any time people lose a significant amount of weight, typically in a short period of time, it is well-known that that can trigger an event called telogen effluvium, which basically is an alteration of the hair cycle in which an abnormal percentage of hair follicles enter into the shedding phase,” ﻿said Dr. Aron Nusbaum, a dermatologist and hair restoration surgeon at the Miami Hair Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800143b6ny1qprdwz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Telogen effluvium can happen three to six months after “an enticing event,” he said, “whether it be a physical or emotional stress, hormonal imbalance, a massive weight loss, a new medication, things like that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800163b6np1jmo6b6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the body is stressed, he said, large numbers of hair follicles in the anagen, or growth, phase prematurely enter the telogen, or resting, phase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjb8dd00023b6qsuibg7ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has to shift priority from nonessential things to more essential things. So hair is a nonessential appendage,” Rossi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhm6yj4100023b6n3969q4u6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Profound weight loss, rather than medication itself, appears to be the major mechanism for hair loss in people who have this particular GLP-1 side effect, said Nusbaum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qhm0800173b6njapt2xvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Brian Wojeck, an obesity medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, likened it to what happens after bariatric surgery, in which patients often experience temporary shedding due to stress and rapid metabolic change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qac5v00063b6n73xxa5i9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wojeck suspects that sudden shifts in nutrition or vitamin levels may also contribute. Some people consider taking multivitamins while on GLP-1 medications to mitigate the effect, he said, although “there isn’t great data saying that taking a multivitamin is going to prevent hair loss.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001h3b6nis2ltt0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi says some patients “are in a chronic malnourished state” while taking GLP-1s because the medication suppresses appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001i3b6ngvuqwv70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’re not getting enough of these micronutrients, your body is not going to be prioritizing anagen hair growth,” he said. “So it’s a mix of metabolic stress and then this relative caloric protein deficiency that happens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001j3b6n43x8fosz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi said the problem is becoming more common as the medications are increasingly used by people seeking cosmetic weight loss and who may not be getting adequate nutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001k3b6ngiz2o6p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The kicker in all this is that they’re being used so willy-nilly, in med spas, in direct-to-consumer compounding pharmacies. People are using them inappropriately,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001l3b6nxwjjk34v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people we see using [the medication] are not obese, and they’re just using it for weight maintenance or weight optimization. People are starting at doses that they probably should not be starting at,” he said. “It’s causing them to not only not eat, but they’re getting less absorption of iron, zinc, vitamin D, B, B-12, all these essential amino acids that are in foods that you normally would be taking in.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001m3b6ny3typaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result, people often fail to meet the nutrient levels needed for hair growth. Each person needs 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight daily for keratin renewal and adequate ferritin, zinc, and vitamins B, D and B-12 for healthy hair, Rossi says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qi5tf001n3b6nhzpimao9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He warned that GLP-1 medications can also have more serious effects, and patients should not use them lightly. “These are real medications that have real side effects. Hair loss, while it’s more cosmetic, can be devastating. But things like pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting, those are real.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qbimm000j3b6n436cd5ji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There may also be other contributing factors to people’s hair loss, says Spencer Kobren, founder of the American Hair Loss Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjguc200043b6qp601qigc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although “much of the hair loss being reported after starting GLP-1 medications could be temporary telogen effluvium related to rapid weight loss or nutritional stress,” he believes “it is entirely plausible that in those genetically predisposed to androgenetic alopecia, [GLP-1s] may be triggering its early onset.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001p3b6nc4sb2hyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nusbaum, of the Miami Hair Institute, said he has started to “see several patients with underlying androgenetic alopecia, which is male- or female-pattern hair loss, where that underlying condition is being exacerbated by the use of these medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmho929ev00023b6qecsf4qy2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Androgenetic alopecia has a distinct pattern. For women, it mainly affects the frontal hairline, where hair meets the forehead. In men, it mainly affects the bitemporal and vertex areas: the sides of the scalp near the temples and the crown of the head, respectively. In contrast, telogen effluvium appears like diffuse hair shedding and thinning across all areas of the scalp.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001q3b6n3dxc8p5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nusbaum points to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190962225001264?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology that examined a possible association between androgenetic alopecia and GLP-1 use, although the findings were inconclusive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001r3b6ngblryt9q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the literature, I don’t think that there is a strong association as of yet, but clinically we are definitely seeing a lot of patients in practice either with telogen effluvium or androgenetic alopecia, which we do believe is somehow being caused by the use of these medications,” Nusbaum said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001s3b6nie54a9qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts are skeptical of this explanation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001t3b6nmpmufrmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From what I can tell, the best described mechanism for hair loss related to these novel weight loss agents is a telogen effluvium mechanism. Other mechanisms are under investigation, however, remain speculative at this time,” Wojeck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qin4h001u3b6nhw6nnfvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rossi added, “Androgenetic alopecia is a pattern. We call it a patterned hair loss. It’s a gradual one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3ri5800003b6n4z2afhst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CNN that hair loss is an identified risk with semaglutide and is listed as a side effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3xvho00053b6n1ie1b1or@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For example, in clinical trials of Wegovy, hair loss was reported in 2.5% of Wegovy-treated adult patients vs 1.0% of placebo-treated adult patients. Hair loss was reported more frequently in patients with a greater weight loss (≥20%) suggesting that the events of hair loss were potentially related to the magnitude of weight loss. Alopecia is also included in the post-marketing experience sections of the Prescribing Information for Ozempic and Rybelsus,” the spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw3uwwl00033b6nkm2kqnau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson from Eli Lilly also said that “hair loss has been observed with weight loss interventions” and that the side effect is listed on Zepbound labels but not Mounjaro, as it is “an adjunct to diet and exercise to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for weight loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhw41f5v000b3b6nc0jdlvri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is addressed in the Zepbound label because it is may be an adverse reaction potentially related to weight reduction,” the spokesperson said. The label notes, “In Zepbound clinical trials, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the Zepbound (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3qj4id00243b6ni62w3cr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say telogen effluvium with GLP-1 use is typically temporary, but people who develop hair loss should seek medical evaluation. Some can go into a chronic telogen effluvium state, in which shedding continues for more than six months, Rossi says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000b3b6n97pdu453@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since telogen effluvium’s hair loss occurs with stress on the body, Moustafa explained, once that stressor is removed, patients should make a full recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfj30lc00003b6qj1yjwct0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Oral minoxidil is a really great medication that is given via a prescription. There are several ways we can intervene pharmacologically on behalf of our patients to try and get them [to recover their hair] faster,” she said, such as the hair-loss medication minoxidil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfjky3n00063b6qe9nfa7zm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is common for patients who need to stay on a medication that is causing telogen effluvium, such as those who may need to keep using the highest dose of Ozempic, Moustafa said. Saffran, who wants to stay on Ozempic because of its other benefits, will be lowering her dosage as well as starting minoxidil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000d3b6n6n4pezr9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Nusbaum points out that “without having the correct diagnosis, you won’t receive the proper treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000e3b6neore5j4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That starts with ruling out any underlying causes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhfehe4p000f3b6n5fihs5ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We look at several lab values, look for vitamin and mineral deficiencies, look for hormonal imbalances, and typically, if it’s telogen effluvium, correcting the underlying cause will lead to a more rapid resolution of the hair shedding and eventual regrowth,” he said. “There are some treatments that can help speed up the cessation of shedding and push the hair cycle back into the regrowth.

            For Saffran, Moustafa first ruled out other causes as well.

            “When I did her exam, she has an amazing hair density at baseline, so she started out with really thick, beautiful hair,” Moustafa said, and there was not any evidence of female-pattern hair loss related to age. “So I think it really is a pure telogen effluvium that she’s experiencing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Moustafa advises people using GLP-1s who are concerned about hair loss to “keep an eye on the rate of your hair shedding and the degree of your weight loss,” as well as “being your own advocate in many ways, discussing these things with your prescribing doctor and asking for the referral so that you can get the support to mitigate it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physicians cannot diagnose people they have not treated, but STAT asked a leading neurologist to consider the question: Why might a 79-year-old man need an MRI scan of his brain?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons, each related to different types of brain disorders. Let’s begin by looking at the statistics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memory complaints are by far the most common reason that one would need a brain MRI. The &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association 2025 Facts and Figures report&lt;/a&gt; notes that 13.2% of individuals ages 75-84 years have Alzheimer’s dementia, with the percentage increasing with age: The percentage jumps to 33.4% of people 85 and older. Dementia means that an individual’s cognition — their thinking and memory — has declined to the point that it interferes with day-to-day function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before one’s thinking and memory have declined to the point that they interfere with function, cognition may still be impaired, leading to daily tasks requiring more effort and taking longer to complete. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment, and it can be detected when people undergo cognitive testing, which is generally performed by a neuropsychologist. Its &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1136393-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; is 14.8% in those ages 75-79, and 25.2% in those aged 80-84. Adding the mild cognitive impairment prevalence (14.8%) to that of the dementia prevalence for 75- to 84-year-olds (13.2%), we have a prevalence of 28% for a 79-year-old to have either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s dementia. Thus, more than one-quarter of 79-year-olds have cognitive impairment, which would lead them to get a brain MRI as part of their workup. Alzheimer’s can be diagnosed with increased certainty if a blood, spinal fluid, or amyloid PET scan biomarker is positive.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage include mild memory problems such as needing reminders, overly relying on GPS/phone apps to navigate even in familiar environments, misplacing and losing things more than before, word-finding difficulties, and trouble performing complicated tasks such as learning how to use a new software package, website, phone app, or board game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the cause of mild cognitive impairment and dementia approximately 60% of the time in people over the age of 75. But there are many other causes of dementia as well. Two disorders often mimic Alzheimer’s disease. Both have nice acronyms due to their long names. PART (primary age-related tauopathy) occurs in just about everyone who lives into their 80s or beyond. PART is believed to be one of the causes of “age-related” memory loss in individuals who do not have dementia, and so it is a large cause of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LATE (limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy) is common cause of dementia and mild cognitive impairment in people over the age of 75. Although many people haven’t heard of LATE, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6536849/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt; it is generally the third most common pathology observed in the brain, after Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cerebrovascular disease — also known as strokes — these are incredibly common and become more common as individuals age, such that the risk of stroke roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5321635/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doubles&lt;/a&gt; every decade after age 55. So, an individual aged 79 has more than five times the risk of stroke as someone who is 55 years old. Risk factors for strokes in addition to age include heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet (particularly with ultra-processed foods), and excessive alcohol. Most 79-year-olds have at least some tiny “mini-strokes” that are observable on an MRI scan. If one has many of these mini-strokes, they can cause mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Strokes can be seen on an MRI scan, which is the imaging study of choice to make the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of vascular mild cognitive impairment are similar to but not the same as those seen in Alzheimer’s disease, and include difficulty in or taking longer to do tasks, such as keeping information “in one’s head”; doing mental arithmetic like calculating the tip in a restaurant; following a route in one’s mind; figuring out how to use a software package, website, phone app, or board game; and finding words.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last common cause of dementia is due to Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies, which are small clumps of protein inside brain cells that damage and then destroy them, are known for causing Parkinson’s disease, but they can cause mild cognitive impairment and dementia as well. When Parkinson’s disease starts first, we generally use the terms “Parkinson’s disease mild cognitive impairment” and “Parkinson’s disease dementia.” If the cognitive disorder starts first, we use the terms “mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies” and “dementia with Lewy bodies.” The core features of these disorders include cognitive impairment, signs of Parkinsonism, fluctuations in attention and alertness, acting out dreams while sleeping, and hallucinations (usually visual). Note that people don’t need to have all these symptoms to be diagnosed with a Lewy body disease. There are now spinal fluid and skin biopsy tests to diagnosis Lewy body diseases.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are other reasons besides strokes and memory problems that a 79-year-old man might need an MRI scan. These include collections of fluid that can accumulate in between the brain and the skull, such as a subdural hematoma. Falls, especially if they include hitting one’s head, can cause subdural hematomas and other types of brain bleeding. Other reasons to get a brain MRI are persistent dizziness or trouble walking, either of which can lead to a fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An MRI is also needed if one has a seizure, which occurs in approximate a dozen people out of every thousand who are age 79. Sometimes a headache is bad enough or persistent enough or unusual enough that one should get an MRI scan to rule out a brain bleed or brain tumor. Lastly, if someone has hearing loss in one ear it could also be due to a brain tumor, so that’s another reason to get an MRI scan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, there are many reasons why a 79-year-old man might need to get an MRI scan. Some reasons are relatively benign, such as a headache or hearing loss, and others are more worrisome, such as signs of stroke or memory loss. Many would require ongoing monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

Glucose is the main source of energy for cells, and its uptake depends on insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. When insulin production is insufficient or the body cannot use insulin effectively, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels. Persistently elevated blood sugar can damage vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, causing serious long-term complications. According to the World Health Organisation, millions of people worldwide live with diabetes, and its prevalence continues to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the types, causes, and risks of diabetes is crucial for effective prevention and management, empowering individuals to make lifestyle choices that reduce complications and support overall long term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the two main types of diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is primarily classified into two main types: Type 1 and Type 2. Both types affect blood sugar regulation but have different causes, onset, progression, and management strategies, as well as varying impacts on long-term health, complications, and daily lifestyle requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in little or no insulin production. It often develops in childhood or adolescence but can also appear in adults. People with Type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Symptoms typically appear suddenly and include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and blurred vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;is far more common and usually develops later in life. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Risk factors include being overweight, physical inactivity, older age, family history, and certain ethnic backgrounds. Symptoms often develop gradually, which may delay diagnosis. Left unmanaged, Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, vision impairment, and nerve problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1 vs Type 2 diabetes: Which is more risky&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes carry serious health risks, but the nature and timing of these risks differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;can cause immediate and life-threatening complications if insulin therapy is missed. One of the most critical short-term risks is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a condition where the body starts breaking down fats for energy, producing toxic ketones that can be fatal if untreated. Managing Type 1 diabetes requires careful daily insulin administration, blood sugar monitoring, and attention to diet and physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 diabetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;develops more gradually, and the risks accumulate silently over time. Chronic high blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks, kidney disease, vision loss, and neuropathy. Early lifestyle interventions such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight are essential to delay or prevent Type 2 diabetes progression. Medications and insulin may also be required if lifestyle changes alone are insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Prevention and risk reduction tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 1 Diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proper management with insulin therapy is essential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular monitoring of blood sugar helps maintain control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy eating and consistent physical activity support overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular medical check-ups detect complications early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Type 2 Diabetes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a healthy body weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage in regular physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow a balanced and nutritious diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid tobacco use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor blood sugar levels regularly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screen for prediabetes and intervene early to prevent progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood pressure and cholesterol to reduce risk of complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;General management for both types:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adhere to prescribed medications and insulin therapy if needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritise lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and stress management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek education and professional support for effective disease management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consistency in daily routines ensures better glycaemic control and long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is based on publicly available health information.

			&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are the world's most common type of mental health condition, impacting the lives of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anxiety-disorders"&gt;360 million people&lt;/a&gt;. But what if there was a way to reverse anxiety's effects?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By 'rebalancing' just a few neurons in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala"&gt;the amygdala&lt;/a&gt; – a part of the brain responsible for decision-making, recall, and managing emotions —&lt;/span&gt; researchers from the Spanish National Research Council and the Miguel Hernández University of Elche (CSIC-UMH) in Spain removed anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="181430" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and social deficits in mice, returning their typical behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rebalancing was done via a gene called &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt;, which has an important role in brain messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When overexpressed, &lt;em&gt;GRIK4&lt;/em&gt; increases the production of a protein called Gluk4, which triggers anxiety-like behaviors. Mice with more of the GluK4 protein tend to avoid open spaces, aren't as comfortable socializing, and show signs of depression, for example.

			&lt;p&gt;One of the world's most common viral infections could underlie virtually every case of lupus, according to a recent study providing the strongest evidence yet for a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by scientists at Stanford University, has found that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epstein%E2%80%93Barr_virus"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; (EBV) could be the trigger behind the '&lt;a href="https://www.lupus.org/understanding-lupus"&gt;cruel mystery&lt;/a&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBV is the pathogen that causes 'kissing disease' (or &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mononucleosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350328"&gt;mononucleosis&lt;/a&gt;), and according to the new findings, it can directly infect and reprogram specific immune cells, potentially driving the onset of the chronic autoimmune disease &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/root-cause-of-lupus-found-in-a-tug-of-war-over-a-critical-white-cell"&gt;systemic lupus erythematosus&lt;/a&gt; – better known as simply lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the single most impactful finding to emerge from my lab in my entire career," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/11/lupus-epstein-barr.html"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; immunologist and head of the lab William Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it applies to 100 percent of lupus cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lupus-tracked-to-changes-in-a-single-gene-that-tames-the-immune-system"&gt;Lupus Tracked to Changes in a Single Gene That Tames The Immune System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of adults in the world have been exposed to EBV at some point in their lives, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="181302" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; causing little to no fuss as it lies latent in their body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with lupus, however, show a deeper infection, possibly because they acquired a more virulent EBV strain. Among patients with the autoimmune condition, researchers found the percentage of B cells infected with EBV is about 1 in 400. That's 25 times higher than in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the infection flicked a switch in B cells, activating a system that 'turns on' their pro-inflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has the potential, "to promote systemic disease–driving autoimmune responses," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, led by immunologist Shady Younis from Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181325" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-642x393.png" alt="EBV B cell" class="wp-image-181325 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-642x393.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-1102x675.png 1102w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-768x470.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell-600x368.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/EBVBcell.png 1502w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181325" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;EBV sequencing enabled identification of EBV-infected B cells in the blood of those with and without lupus.

Only in the 19th century did experts officially recognize and describe lupus, which can cause a rash resembling a wolf's bite (hence the historical Latin name).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enduring mystery of lupus is often pinned down to its complex nature, possibly triggered by &lt;a href="https://www.lupus.org/resources/what-causes-lupus"&gt;numerous interacting factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as nutrient deficiencies, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-lupus-causing-gene-provides-a-potential-target-for-better-treatments"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal issues, or infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research from Stanford suggests there really may be a unifying explanation – one with viral origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, researchers have suspected that EBV is linked to lupus. The virus is known to infect B cells, and B-cell activity is known to be imbalanced in those with lupus. The trouble is, EBV is hard to measure when it infects and hides out in B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford devised a clever way to find which of these white blood cells are infected with the virus. Using their new sequencing technique, the team demonstrated that people with lupus have significantly more EBV-infected B cells than those without lupus, especially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_B_cell"&gt;memory B cells&lt;/a&gt;, which enable rapid immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181324" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-642x642.avif" alt="Memory B Cells Comic" class="wp-image-181324 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-642x642.avif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-675x675.avif 675w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-768x768.avif 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2-600x600.avif 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_4df5d2c487ff47018651757e5a5cb8ebmv2.avif 802w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181324" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Memory B cells 'remember' specific pathogens so they can launch quick immune responses. (&lt;a href="https://www.synscicommics.com/"&gt;Synscicomics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the hundreds of billions of B cells in a healthy human body, only about 20 percent are 'autoreactive', or primed to produce  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="181302" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/root-cause-of-lupus-found-in-a-tug-of-war-over-a-critical-white-cell"&gt;activate killer immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.' But when EBV infects latent B cells, it appears to flip them back into a pro-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for why only a small fraction of EBV-infected individuals develop SLE," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism is supported by a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lupus-patients-go-into-remission-in-spectacular-immunotherapy-trial"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; for lupus, which hunts down and replaces faulty B cells. It showed remarkable benefits in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="181302" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, achieving remission-like outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virologist Guy Gorochov from Sorbonne University in France, who was not involved in the current study, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/12/epstein-barr-virus-appears-to-be-trigger-of-lupus-disease-say-scientists"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Guardian's&lt;/em&gt; Hannah Devlin that the work was "impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not the final paper about lupus," he added, "but they've done a lot and developed an interesting concept."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the findings may even be relevant to other autoimmune conditions linked to EBV, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smoking-gun-study-reveals-how-virus-may-trigger-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mounting-evidence-suggests-many-covid-19-long-haulers-are-co-infected-with-epstein-barr"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/viral-origins-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-may-be-hiding-in-plain-sight"&gt;myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

By this point I couldn't do any of them.

However, in about half of these donations after circulatory death (DCD) cases, the transplant ends up being cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That is because the time between the removal of life support and death must not exceed 45 minutes. If the donor does not die within the timeframe needed to preserve organ quality, surgeons often reject the liver because of the increased risk of complications to the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now doctors, scientists and researchers at Stanford University have developed a machine learning model that predicts whether a donor is likely to die within the timeframe during which their organs are viable for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The AI tool outperformed the judgment of top surgeons and reduced the rate of futile procurements – which occur when transplant preparations have begun but the donor dies too late – by 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By identifying when an organ is likely to be useful before any preparations for surgery have started, this model could make the transplant process more efficient,” said Dr Kazunari Sasaki, a clinical professor of abdominal transplantation and senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It also has the potential to allow more candidates who need an organ transplant to receive one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Details of the breakthrough were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00100-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the Lancet Digital Health journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advance could reduce the number of instances in which healthcare workers prepare organs for recovery, only to determine they are unsuitable for recovery and transplantation, putting financial and operational strain on transplant centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hospitals primarily rely on surgeons’ judgment to estimate this critical timeframe, which can vary widely and lead to unnecessary costs and wasted resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new AI tool was trained on data from more than 2,000 donors across several US transplant centres. It uses neurological, respiratory and circulatory data to predict a potential donor’s progression to death with greater accuracy than previous models and human experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

&lt;p&gt;“While mismatched vaccines may still provide protection, enhanced genetic, antigenic and epidemiological (eg, vaccine effectiveness) monitoring are warranted to inform risk assessment and response,” Skowronski and colleagues concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the UK Health Security Agency published a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025"&gt;preliminary study&lt;/a&gt; finding that, despite the mismatch, this year’s shot still seems to provide important protection. The study found that soon after vaccination, the vaccine provided 70 to 75 percent protection against hospitalization in children aged 2 to 17 years, and 30 to 40 percent protection from hospitalization in adults. These protection levels are within the typical range for flu vaccines, but they’re more often seen at the end of a season—when vaccine protection has waned some—rather than early in the season, soon after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, officials called the results “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;reassuring&lt;/a&gt;.” In particular, officials noted the strong numbers in children, which parents can tell you, have the ability to be superspreaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The high vaccine effectiveness in children strengthens the case for ensuring all eligible young people get vaccinated,” Jamie Lopez Bernal, Consultant Epidemiologist for Immunisation at UKHSA, said. “When more children are protected, it helps stop the spread of flu to others around them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that it’s looking possible that we may be facing a very bad flu season this year, and the best thing we can all do right now to tackle the problem is to get vaccinated,” Adam Finn, professor of Paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s unclear how flu vaccinations are going in the US this season, at the end of last season, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-coverage.html"&gt;about 47 percent of adults&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;49 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; had received vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases — by reprogramming patients’ out-of-whack immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your body’s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today’s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don’t fix what’s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects — and too often the drugs aren’t enough to keep their disease in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-live-the-winner-of-the-nobel-prize-in-medicine-is-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Nobel Prize in medicine awarded to 3 scientists for their study of the immune system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re entering a new era,” said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who’s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer “the chance to control disease in a way we’ve never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who’ve exhausted today’s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What the heck is wrong with my body?” Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn’t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital’s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, “I’m going to trust you.” Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can actually run, I can chase my kid,” said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. “I had forgotten what it was to be me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;‘Living drugs’ reset rogue immune systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas — immune cells called B cells — go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she’s been in remission — with no other medicine — since March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma — and few relapses so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those early results were “shocking,” Hopkins’ Konig recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient’s blood and sent to a lab, where they’re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those “living drugs” are infused back into the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can’t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they’re healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Other ways to reprogram rogue cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach uses “peacekeeper” cells at the center of this year’s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don’t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body’s existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen’s Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Grieshaber-Bouyer reported giving a course of one such drug, teclistamab, to 10 patients with a variety of diseases including Sjögren’s, myositis and systemic sclerosis. All but one improved significantly and six went into drug-free remission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Next-generation precision options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins’ Konig aims to get more precise, targeting “only that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B cells have identifiers, like biological barcodes, showing they can produce faulty antibodies, Konig said. Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark “bad” B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Green’s lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It’s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells — and they’re outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green’s team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune “generals” to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they’d “divide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,” Green said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will know it’s working if that galaxy-like map shows less red and more yellow. Studies in people are still a few years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Could you predict autoimmune diseases — and delay or prevent them?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drug for Type 1 diabetes “is forging the path,” said Dr. Kevin Deane at the University of Colorado Anshutz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he’s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On all these fronts, there’s a tremendous amount of research left to do — and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T’s safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma — and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just remember I woke up one day and thought, ‘Oh my god, I don’t feel sick anymore,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of result has researchers optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never been closer to getting to — and we don’t like to say it — a potential cure,” said Hopkins’ Konig. “I think the next 10 years will dramatically change our field forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

The organ survived for 61 days in the recipient, a 57-year-old brain-dead man in the United States, the longest a genetically modified pig organ has survived in a brain-dead person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two papers&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; today, researchers describe the main factors that cause the human immune system to reject transplanted organs. Researchers say the findings will improve outcomes for living people who receive organs from other people, or from animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my mind, this is the first evidence of how to reverse rejection,” says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a clinician researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who led the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04185-3/index.html#section-X6su349JZz" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-04185-3/index.html#section-X6su349JZz" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;first pig-heart transplant&lt;/a&gt; into a living person in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past three years, around a dozen living people have received organs from genetically modified pigs, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00111-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00111-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00368-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00368-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01613-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01613-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;livers&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01453-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;thymus&lt;/a&gt;. But most of these organs were eventually removed after losing function or no longer providing enough benefit to justify the immunosuppression treatment required. Other recipients died shortly after the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the pig kidney, the male recipient also received the pig’s thymus, a small gland that taught the man’s immune system to recognize the pig’s cells as part of the body. The thymus probably played a big role in helping the pig organ survive for longer, says co-author of the studies, Robert Montgomery, a surgeon and researcher at the New York University Langone Transplant Institute in New York City. In past experiments with non-human primates, he says, the modified kidney survived better when transplanted with the thymus than without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding rejection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest pig-organ transplant was performed on 14 July 2023 at New York University Langone in New York City. The kidney and thymus were taken from a pig supplied by Revivicor, a subsidiary of biotechnology firm United Therapeutics, based in Virginia. The pigs had a single genetic modification, removing gene GGAT1, to stop the production of a sugar called alpha-gal on cells. Alpha-gal has been found to cause organ rejection in transplant surgeries in non-human primates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the transplant, the kidney appeared healthy and produced urine. But 33 days after the procedure, the kidney’s function suddenly declined, and a biopsy showed that the organ was being rejected and damaged by antibodies. The team replaced the person’s plasma and gave them steroids and a drug called pegcetacoplan, which stopped pig cells being tagged for destruction by the immune system. But on day 49, another biopsy showed a different type of rejection, in which inflammatory cells had infiltrated the kidney’s surface.

They are currently receiving treatment in King County, following previous care in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are investigating potential sources of the infection, including contact with wild or domestic birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the preliminary positive test, public health disease experts have not identified any risk to the general public. The Washington State Department of Health is collaborating with local health departments and healthcare facilities to support the ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza, colloquially called bird flu, is caused by the influenza type A virus and naturally occurs in wild aquatic birds. It can infect other bird species and occasionally mammals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases are rare and typically mild, with symptoms such as conjunctivitis, fever, and respiratory issues. Most human infections have been linked to exposure to sick or infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently considers the risk to the public from avian influenza to be low. However, people who work with or have recreational contact with potentially infected animals are advised to take precautions, including wearing personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are monitoring anyone who has been in close contact with the patient to ensure that human-to-human transmission is not occurring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of avian influenza increases in the fall and winter due to migratory birds spreading the virus to domestic animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with backyard poultry should avoid contact with sick or dead birds and report any illness to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Veterinarians are urged to report suspected cases in domestic animals or livestock. Additionally, the public is advised to avoid handling sick or dead wildlife and to report such cases to the Washington State Department of Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of simultaneous infection with human and avian influenza viruses, it is recommended that individuals, especially those exposed to sick birds, receive a seasonal flu vaccine. The vaccine is advised for everyone six months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 21:48:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAJBVV95cUxPbUFBRmt4aFZlNGpXbUd1YWZQT2VDdG5WdGxLdHVzcmhCOEwyU2s2NjEtZ3R4d1RpMlBnVld0aTdmLWtDVTUzcjhiVTRfTlNuMlVDYmJYREl6bFJlelFZMV9NOFdpSTVPb1V4cjVCNEp0UEQ4bGp6Nk9JWDlqUUZxWjFKNE40X1REemRZRlhncUlMdldKRXE3amtzdzhmR2x5SVJpUGUtbjBoWExnRUR2T0tpcXpIVDRuOTV5UmhPWGp5SVFJeXlZc0hIME1jTE5fN1pPamktQ3pFWVFUSmhGNkNRNWFaS3k2RS11R1pQZDYzQWJMUFRUdTNzTFVmZXFjZ0poOV9BWmRqOVNOTDJjUEtuVi1rV2x1eUZPdTh2Sjh6MkhEeDhtN29QN1RScFkza0pWbUZZMHhKeGNiWEQ5dTJMRmxtNFQtVkpwTg</guid></item><item><title>微小的芯片搭乘免疫细胞到达炎症部位- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/tiny-chips-hitch-a-ride-on-immune-cells-to-sites-of-inflammation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          
&lt;p&gt;Standard brain implants use electrodes that penetrate the gray matter to stimulate and record the activity of neurons. These typically need to be put in place via a surgical procedure. To go around that need, a team of researchers led by Deblina Sarkar, an electrical engineer and MIT assistant professor, developed microscopic electronic devices hybridized with living cells. Those cells can be injected into the circulatory system with a standard syringe and will travel the bloodstream before implanting themselves in target brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the first two years of working on this technology at MIT, we’ve got 35 grant proposals rejected in a row,” Sarkar says. “Comments we got from the reviewers were that our idea was very impactful, but it was impossible.” She acknowledges that the proposal sounded like something you can find in science fiction novels. But after more than six years of research, she and her colleagues have pulled it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nanobot problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when Sarkar and her colleagues gathered initial data and got some promising results with their cell-electronics hybrids, the team proposed the project for the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award. For the first time, after 35 rejections, it made it through peer review. “We got the highest impact score ever,” Sarkar says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for that score was that her technology solved three extremely difficult problems. The first, obviously, was making functional electronic devices smaller than cells that can circulate in our blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Previous explorations, which had not seen a lot of success, relied on putting magnetic particles inside the bloodstream and then guiding them with magnetic fields,” Sarkar explains. “But there is a difference between electronics and particles.” Electronics made using CMOS technology (which we use for making computer processors) can generate electrical power from incoming light in the same way as photovoltaics, as well as perform computations necessary for more intelligent applications like sensing. Particles, on the other hand, can only be used to stimulate cells to an extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_94-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This Mini Meatloaves &amp;amp; Veggies recipe is an easy, all-in-one sheet-pan dinner that will keep your weeknight simple. The mini meatloaves, made with either meatloaf mix or lean ground beef, cook alongside tender carrots and zucchini for a balanced meal with minimal cleanup. It’s a no-fuss dinner that serves two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_98-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This sheet-pan crispy chicken is an all-in-one meal that delivers big flavor with minimal cleanup. The trick lies in the clever use of the sheet pan: tender vegetables roast in the center, while the chicken cooks along the outer edges where the oven runs hotter. This allows the chicken to develop a golden, crispy crust with just a light coating of cooking spray.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_102-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This chickpea-farro grain bowl is a hearty dish that’s packed with plant-based protein, fiber and tons of fresh flavor. Farro, a whole grain with a nutty taste and chewy texture, forms the base and pairs perfectly with tender chickpeas and veggies. If you don’t have farro on hand, you can easily swap in quinoa, brown rice or barley.

The technology could allow doctors to administer small amounts of drugs to specific sites, avoiding the toxic side effects of body-wide therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microrobots — guided by magnetic fields — work in blood vessels in pigs and sheep, researchers showed in a paper published in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; on 13 November&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system has yet to be trialled in people, but it shows promise because it works in a roughly human-sized body, and because all its components have already been shown to be biocompatible, says Bradley Nelson, a mechanical engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, who co-led the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around one-third of developed drugs that fail to come to market do so because they’re too toxic&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, says Nelson. The team says the microrobots would allow smaller amounts of drugs to be given directly to the affected areas, thereby reducing potential side effects. The technique could be used to target stroke-causing blockages or brain tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demonstrations are compelling but still preclinical,” says Wei Gao, a medical engineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, whose team has developed an alternative robotic drug-delivery system. But if further studies proceed smoothly, remote-controlled drug-delivery robots could be used in the first medical applications within five to ten years, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03754-6/d41586-025-03754-6_51706798.gif?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03754-6/d41586-025-03754-6_51706798.gif?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A looping animated sequence showing an insertion catheter with a gripper arm releasing a microrobot into a clear demonstration replica of a human vein." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03754-6/d41586-025-03754-6_51706798.gif"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: ETH Zürich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Robot-delivered drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have explored how to use &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03480-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03480-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;tiny robots to deliver drugs for decades&lt;/a&gt;, including by steering them using ultrasound and using rotating devices that mimic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system developed by the ETH team involves filling a tiny bead of gelatine with a drug, as well as nanoparticles of magnetic iron oxide, which allows its movement to be controlled by magnetic fields surrounding the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trials in the brains of pigs and sheep, the team showed that they could use a catheter to insert the bots, before making them roll along the edges of blood vessels, swim against the flow or navigate with the stream at speeds as fast as 40 centimetres per second. They used X-ray images to observe and manoeuvre the bots in real time with millimetre-precision. In trials in pigs, the team showed that in more than 95% of cases, the drugs were delivered to the correct location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fever of unidentified cause in Ethiopia have prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to dispatch a team of responders and deliver medical supplies to the southern part of the country, near its border with South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/ethiopia-suspected-viral-haemorrhagic-fever-outbreak"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; today, WHO Africa said that Ethiopian health authorities are ramping up their response and conducting lab tests to identify the cause of the infection and stop further transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To support the national authorities, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks to help strengthen disease surveillance, investigation, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, clinical care, outbreak response coordination and community engagement," the WHO wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia's Health Ministry will likely announce the results of the ongoing investigation tomorrow, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/13/ethiopia-viral-hemorrhagic-fever-outbreak-who/22aa9f7e-c0a3-11f0-8eee-a78486b4c797_story.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;media reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provision of personal protective equipment, financial aid&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO is providing essential supplies such as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, infection-prevention materials, and a rapidly deployable isolation tent to improve clinical care and boost management capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of 11 technical officers with experience in responding to viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization has also released $300,000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to provide immediate support and is marshaling technical capacity to support the response.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral hemorrhagic fevers, a group of epidemic-prone diseases caused by several distinct families of viruses, include Marburg, Ebola, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms vary by virus, but initially they often include high fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, weakness, and exhaustion. All cases, whether single or in clusters, should be immediately reported to health authorities without waiting for identification of the causative pathogen, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Below are five often-overlooked triggers that are linked to insulin resistance as per experts and research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAJBVV95cUxPSTQ2d292akkzYVZSSXoxTmhEWDRGZGJUTkVKcjNtWnJDV3J6RXRJOWhLYmFrWmJ3UUlHQTlQb284a0FvNTdMN1RabW80OXctbjFpdGh2RHFDdlhiS3JSaU80YlN5bTB5THVEMkoxZHV1bVNLUElhS2J4YmFEYnVrd0htS0ZhSVQyUTdrSmNqWXdWcGhGdzVZNkplLXlMdmZTSW9Bcm1VUFd3NmhwSzR2SmZpM0hMMUdvNkZ1eHhyNldIcUUwanFRNGtxdWZJT0x5c0NqaGNyT0EzLUkwX2pfODFabC03NmpMcDd1MFcxc1NBY0pLZ1dNRWM3U3ZsX3MxQVNJaFhOYmpJSENuUUJNZy1CcjdNWm16MVhCUE1VQm4</guid></item><item><title>埃塞俄比亚调查8人感染后可能爆发的新型病毒性出血热- abcnews.go.com</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/ethiopia-investigates-outbreak-new-viral-hemorrhagic-fever-after-127487733</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;NAIROBI, Kenya -- &lt;/span&gt;African health authorities on Thursday confirmed a possible outbreak of an unidentified viral hemorrhagic fever in southern Ethiopia that is under investigation after eight suspected cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ethiopia's Health Ministry is expected to announce the results of the ongoing investigation on Friday, according to the Africa CDC, the continent-wide health response body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Viral hemorrhagic fevers are a group of epidemic-prone diseases and include Marburg and Ebola virus diseases, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever — all of which have been reported on the continent in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The World Health Organization said Thursday that it was deploying 11 technical officers to support Ethiopia in the investigation and outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“WHO is also providing essential supplies, including personal protective equipment for health workers and infection-prevention supplies, as well as a rapidly deployable isolation tent to bolster clinical care and management capacity,” the U.N. agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The outbreak has been reported in the southern region of Omo, which borders neighboring South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya said Thursday that the outbreak was a concern because “South Sudan isn’t far and has a fragile health system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Several countries in East and Central Africa have recently experienced outbreaks of various viral hemorrhagic fevers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:19:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新： 2025年11月13日-每日科斯</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/11/13/2353571/-Infectious-Updates-11-13-25</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which might be why &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/botulism/quick-takes-more-infant-botulism-cases-measles-louisiana-ebola-dr-congo" target="_blank"&gt;There are more infant botulism cases in more states&lt;/a&gt;, and ByHeart has now recalled ALL its infant formula.  All the infants have been hospitalized but none have died. 🤞.&lt;/p&gt;

While it does tend to cycle in two year intervals, the peaks seem to be getting higher as vaccination rates have dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H3N2 human flu acquired new mutations over the summer, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evere-flu-strain-h3n2-us-response-outbreaks-canada-uk-rcna243431" target="_blank"&gt;AFTER the vaccine strains had been chosen&lt;/a&gt;.  The new subclade K is causing major outbreaks in Japan, Canada, and the UK.  The US CDC is, of course, absent due to being gutted and then shut down for six weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season" target="_blank"&gt;The H3N2 strain is dominating&lt;/a&gt; in UK samples, making up as much as 90% of cases.  Last year's season was almost equally split between H1N1 and H3N2.  H3 is generally harder on the elderly, more likely to cause hospitalization. But even a mismatched vaccine does some good, so get it if you haven't, and MASK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good vaccine news: &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/malaria/real-world-study-malaria-vaccine-effectiveness-matches-clinical-trials" target="_blank"&gt;Real world study of malaria vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is as good as the clinical trials.

                &lt;p&gt;Scientists may have uncovered an important aspect of long covid. Recent research appears to show that the blood of these patients often contains unusual clusters of microscopic material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stellenbosch University in South Africa examined the blood of people with and without long covid. Those with the chronic condition had a greater amount of microclots combined with web-like structures called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the study found. The findings could help doctors better identify long covid cases and might even help explain some of the symptoms these patients experience, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings present a significant advancement in the understanding of the interactions between NETs and microclots in long covid,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70613"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in The Journal of Medical Virology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microclots and NETs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Long covid is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-challenges-of-unravelling-long-covid-1846644037"&gt;complex condition&lt;/a&gt; and is likely to be caused by a mix of factors, including viral persistence or an ongoing dysfunctional immune response to the earlier covid infection. But some research has suggested that the symptoms of long covid, such as lasting fatigue or brain fog, can be linked to chronic inflammation and blood clotting issues, at least for some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s past work and others have found that people with long covid are more likely to have tiny fiber-like particles in their blood, dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2023/05/16/long-covid-scientists-try-to-unravel-blood-clot-mystery/"&gt;microclots&lt;/a&gt;, than the average person, for instance. Other studies have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565006/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that long covid patients also have higher amounts of NETs, sticky structures produced by immune cells called neutrophils that help trap germs. Though NETs are important to combatting infections, their excess presence may &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01933-x"&gt;contribute&lt;/a&gt; to harmful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this latest research, the Stellenbosch team wanted to better understand how the NETs and microclots seen in long covid patients might interact with one another, if at all. They compared the blood of 50 people diagnosed with long covid to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They found that people with long covid had higher levels of biomarkers linked to both NETs and microclots than the controls. Long covid patients seemed to have larger microclots on average as well. And perhaps most importantly, those with long covid also appeared to have more microclots that were structurally connected to NETs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, NETs might play an important role in keeping microclots safe from eradication by the body, which could then explain why people’s long covid symptoms continue to linger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We suggest that higher NETs formation might promote the stabilization of microclots in the circulation, potentially leading to deleterious effects which contribute causally to the LC syndrome,” they wrote. If so, finding a safe and effective way to clear microclots and NETs could potentially alleviate symptoms as well, they add.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;More research needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intriguing as these findings are, they’re certainly not the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While research has found that people with long covid are more likely to have microclots, for instance, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD015775_what-evidence-microclots-cause-post-covid-19-syndrome-and-removal-using-plasmapheresis-justified"&gt;not clear yet&lt;/a&gt; if and to what extent these structures are responsible for causing people’s illness. And given the complicated nature of the condition, it’s certainly possible only some people’s long covid will end up conclusively linked to these particles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers say their work could still help doctors devise tests that can easily identify long covid cases—something that isn’t possible today. In this current study, they developed an algorithm that appeared to accurately distinguish between long covid patients and controls, based on their distinctive biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though covid-19 is no longer the pandemic threat it once was, the infectious disease is not gone. And there are still millions of people worldwide &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-common-is-long-covid-1849130767"&gt;believed to be afflicted&lt;/a&gt; by long covid. The more we understand about its mechanisms, the greater the chance we can develop effective treatments for these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But at the same time, we know the vast majority of bowel cancers we see in young people arise from these precursor lesions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.4777?guestAccessKey=f519cbac-0500-444e-a957-91e4ae77c2e7&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=111325" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Jama Oncology&lt;/a&gt;, Chan and colleagues report how they studied data collected as part of the US-based Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), which began in 1989 and involved female nurses born between 1947 and 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From 1991, participants were asked to complete a food questionnaire every four years in which they reported how often they had eaten various items over the previous 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team studied data from 29,105 participants who had completed the questionnaires, undergone a colonoscopy at some point after 1991, and did not have a prior history of polyps, inflammatory bowel disease or any type of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These participants were followed until June 2015, by which time all had reached the age of 50. By then, 1,189 cases of early-onset conventional adenomas and 1,598 cases of another type of polyp, known as a serrated lesion, had been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team divided participants into five equal sized groups based on their UPF consumption, finding that compared with the group that ate the least UPF – on average 3.3 servings a day – the group that ate the most – on average 9.9 servings a day – had a 45% greater risk of having early onset conventional adenomas once factors such as BMI, smoking and physical activity were taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, there was no associated risk of developing serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study has limitations including that it is based on participants’ recall of food, may be complicated by difficulties in classifying foods as UPFs, did not look at the development of bowel cancer itself, and cannot prove UPFs cause the development of polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, Chen said there were several plausible mechanisms that could explain the results, noting UPFs had been associated with metabolic disorders linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes that were associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer. He also said UPFs could promote a general state of chronic inflammation, or might impact gut microbes and the gut lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chan said while it was likely the results would also hold for men, more research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It doesn’t suggest that if you eat UPFs, that you are inevitably going to develop cancer. That’s certainly not our message,” he said. “But it’s a piece of the puzzle in terms of what might be driving underlying cancer rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fiona Osgun, the head of health information at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, said that while the study did not directly measure cancer risk, it offered a useful insight into how diet might influence early changes in the bowel that sometimes led to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Osgun added that policy-level changes were needed to make healthier diets more accessible for everyone. “Our overall diet matters more for cancer risk than any single food type,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPTERKYWVtVDBuRU5yXzhzVXlicHBJMDBqV0RXRVBxMzFCTE5lazFQRDV5SzlCblYxMnREM3l0ckNTQ3hqQk4xV1FYNl9HLXFJal9pSnhWVnctS2laN0VDN0xJSE5IRlgwMU96cThPSmE4eDNpZEJ0V1VIUUotc2pEV2ZPeG5URDluX0NmR2J2cjFVZkdUMTBWUy1ZU18tLUFueWtvcjJYc3NsblZDenpZSnYxRVNuLU5yRlNLRW1VcjUtVldrSGQtWmtmMEFrOXM</guid></item><item><title>CRISPR与胆固醇：基因编辑可以预防心脏病吗？ -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03711-3</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51702842.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51702842.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Coloured scanning electron micrograph of cholesterol crystals (blue) within a lipid droplet (brown) in a human liver." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51702842.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Crystalline forms of cholesterol (blue) in a liver cell (purple), imaged using a scanning electron microscope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CRISPR–Cas9 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03797-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03797-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene-editing therapy&lt;/a&gt; has halved people’s &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00955-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00955-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; in a small clinical trial — raising hopes that, with further study, gene editing could one day be harnessed to provide a one-stop treatment for a common cause of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02916-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02916-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers used CRISPR to disable a gene called &lt;i&gt;ANGPTL3&lt;/i&gt; that helps to regulate levels of fatty molecules, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or ‘bad’ cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood.

But, if all goes well in future studies, investigators hope that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03566-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene editing&lt;/a&gt; might one day liberate many thousands of people from daily regimens of cholesterol-lowering medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What a revolution to be able to do that,” says Luke Laffin, a specialist in preventative cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and a lead investigator on the trial. “Conceptually, it’s a great idea: we can move from chronic therapy to something that’s one-and-done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That revolution will take years: considerably more safety testing would be needed to make the concept a reality, he adds. And there are questions about how much such a treatment would cost, and whether consumers would be willing to embrace it. But the trial results — published in the &lt;i&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt; on 8 November — are the latest to show promise in harnessing gene-editing techniques to tackle some of the most common diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decade-long dream&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dream scenario for me is getting these gene-editing therapies broadly applied,” says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “These things are coming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over a decade ago, Musunuru wondered if CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing, then a new technology, could be harnessed to prevent or treat the world’s leading killer: cardiovascular disease. He pitched the idea to a few venture capitalists. “No one was interested at all,” he says. Instead, they wanted to focus on rare genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02802-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03711-3/d41586-025-03711-3_51425162.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Hope for diabetes: CRISPR-edited cells pump out insulin in a person – and evade immune detection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Musunuru says he knows of about a dozen companies that intend to use gene editing to tackle high cholesterol. Other cardiovascular projects include treatments for a rarer condition called transthyretin amyloidosis, which can lead to heart failure. Biotechnology company CRISPR Therapeutics in Zug, Switzerland — the sponsor of the current cholesterol trial — has begun work on a gene-editing therapy to treat high blood pressure. “It’s fertile ground,” says Musunuru, who is himself a co-founder of a company that’s pursuing similar treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shifting from rare diseases to more common ones will require big safety studies that are capable of detecting unusual side effects, and CRISPR-based therapies have been used in only a few hundred people so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study, published in the Nature journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03206-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, synthesizes decades of research and suggests that this chemical difference could open new avenues for understanding and potentially treating these common and debilitating illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders, which include conditions like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and social phobias, represent the most common category of mental illness in the United States. “Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults,” said Richard Maddock, the study’s senior author and a research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Davis. “They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions are understood to involve complex interactions between different brain regions. Areas like the amygdala, which acts as a threat detector, and the prefrontal cortex, which helps manage planning and emotional responses, can become dysregulated. This can cause the brain to perceive manageable, everyday stressors as overwhelming threats, leading to persistent worry and nervousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research comes from Maddock and his colleague Jason Smucny, an assistant professor at UC Davis. Maddock, a psychiatrist who has spent decades treating patients and researching anxiety, had previously observed low levels of choline in his own studies of people with panic disorder. This prompted him and Smucny to investigate whether this was a consistent pattern seen across the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find an answer, the researchers conducted a meta-analysis, a type of study that systematically combines and analyzes the results of many previous independent studies. This method allows scientists to detect broad patterns that might not be apparent in smaller, individual experiments. They gathered data from 25 separate studies, creating a large dataset that included 370 people diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and 342 people without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies they analyzed all used a specialized, non-invasive imaging technique called proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This method uses the same type of machine as a standard magnetic resonance imaging scan, which creates pictures of the body’s internal structures. Instead of producing an image, however, this technique provides a chemical profile of a specific brain region, allowing researchers to measure the concentration of different molecules, known as neurometabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a distinct and consistent chemical difference. Across the various anxiety disorders, individuals with these conditions had lower levels of choline-containing compounds in their brains. The reduction was most pronounced in the brain’s cortex, the outer layer responsible for higher-order functions like thinking, decision-making, and emotional regulation. The finding was especially consistent in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the level of choline was about 8% lower in those with anxiety disorders. While this number might seem small, even minor changes in the brain’s chemical environment can have significant effects on its function. “An 8% lower amount doesn’t sound like that much, but in the brain it’s significant,” Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this chemical pattern was “transdiagnostic,” meaning it appeared to be a common feature across different types of anxiety disorders rather than being unique to one specific condition. The team also examined whether other factors, such as patient medication, age, or the technical specifications of the brain scans, could explain the results. The link between anxiety and lower choline held firm, suggesting it is a robust biological marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding became even more defined when the researchers assessed the quality of the measurements in the original studies. In the subset of studies that used the most precise measurement techniques, the reduction in choline was even more apparent. This strengthens the confidence that the observed difference is a real phenomenon and not an artifact of inconsistent data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at other neurometabolites, including N-acetylaspartate, a molecule often used as an indicator of the health and integrity of neurons. After removing a few outlier studies from the analysis, the researchers found a small but significant reduction in this molecule as well, suggesting a possible widespread effect on neuronal function in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline is an essential nutrient that plays a fundamental part in building cell membranes and producing neurotransmitters involved in memory, mood, and muscle control. While the body can produce a small amount on its own, the majority must be obtained through food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that the chronic state of high alert, or “fight-or-flight” response, common in anxiety disorders may increase the brain’s metabolic activity. This heightened state could place a greater demand on choline resources to maintain neural circuits, gradually leading to lower overall levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that this study identifies a strong correlation, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It is not yet clear whether lower choline levels contribute to the development of anxiety, or if the biological processes of anxiety itself cause choline levels to drop. Further work is needed to untangle this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these open questions, the finding points toward potential new strategies for patient care. “This is the first meta-analysis to show a chemical pattern in the brain in anxiety disorders,” said Smucny. “It suggests nutritional approaches — like appropriate choline supplementation — may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to test this idea directly. “We don’t know yet if increasing choline in the diet will help reduce anxiety. More research will be needed,” Maddock said. He cautions that people experiencing anxiety should not begin taking high-dose choline supplements on their own, as the effects are not yet understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the research highlights the connection between diet and mental well-being. A healthy diet is a cornerstone of overall health, and ensuring adequate nutrient intake may be particularly relevant for brain function. Choline is found in a variety of foods, including eggs, beef, chicken, soybeans, and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Someone with an anxiety disorder might want to look at their diet and see whether they are getting the recommended daily amount of choline,” Maddock noted, adding that many people in the U.S. do not consume enough. “Some forms of omega-3 fatty acids, like those found in salmon, may be especially good sources for supplying choline to the brain.” This discovery of a consistent chemical signature offers a new window into the biology of anxiety and reinforces the idea that what we eat has a profound connection to how we feel and think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03206-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Transdiagnostic reduction in cortical choline-containing compounds in anxiety disorders: a 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Richard J.

Now, they may have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the first of two studies published Thursday in the journal Nature, researchers at NYU Langone Health have discovered immune reactions that may explain why these organs get rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team looked at the transplantation of a genetically engineered pig kidney into a patient who was brain dead but had a beating heart and was on a ventilator in the ICU. The family had donated the patient's body to science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For more than two months after the surgery, the NYU Langone team performed biopsies and collected samples of blood, tissue and bodily fluid from the patient in a way that's "impossible" to do in primates or living patients, according to Dr. Robert Montgomery, lead author of the study and director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Stock photo of doctors performing a surgery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Alvaro Gonzalez/STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We could really get a very dense set of data points from doing biopsies, taking blood samples, body fluid samples and create an atlas of what that immune response looks like," he told ABC News. "And that's what's really unique about the study. I think that this is probably the most deeply studied human in history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The team learned that pig organs were being rejected due to an immune system reaction from specific antibodies -- which recognize and attach themselves to foreign substances so they can be removed from the body -- and from T cells, which are white blood cells that help the body fight off germs and other unfamiliar invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;After rejection, the team used an FDA-approved drug combination to successfully reverse it, with no signs of permanent damage or reduced kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's a huge step forward," Montgomery said. "I think it makes transplantation just that much more of a successful endeavor. As we move forward, I do believe that we will be in a position in the next few years where gene-edited pig organs will be an alternative to human organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a second study published in Nature, Montgomery and his team looked at the body's immune response to the pig organ in greater detail. By measuring levels of biomarkers in the blood, they were able to spot an attack up to five days before it would be visible in bodily tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Montgomery said this can help transplant teams anticipate a potential rejection sooner and diagnose it quickly so it can be subsequently treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;More than 101,000 Americans are in need of a kidney transplant but only 17,000 receive a transplant every year, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.kidney.org/be-organ-donor" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, 12 people die every day while waiting for a kidney. The average wait time on the transplant list can be as long as 10 years. Montgomery said finding a way for more people waiting on the list to receive a kidney with gene-edited pig organs, while lowering the risk of rejection, is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"That's a great shortcoming of our health care system that we have to ration something that we know works so well," Montgomery said. "I think we really do need an alternative source of organs to really change this game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The procedure, while considered by many to be a medical breakthrough, is still controversial, with some critics expressing ethical concerns about altering animal organs and potential health risks for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Some patients who have undergone the procedure have had the genetically modified pig kidneys removed after organ rejection or unrelated infection. At least two patients have died after transplantation, although doctors say these patients were terminal and were experiencing end-stage kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNdFdOVWQ1dUEyd09lNUphczlYWC03YnJQVnY2V1F2X0lLd3BRMjJEVFhxYk5Mbml6OGYwdW9CeVRDaTdCMlVQWGFTZWV3cGpndDEtb1lKYTBiVzZENDhkNS1fWkxwMnJfNGxuaFhYTE8tdVhyQ1ZOLVM4VWtDMXBqZEpMeUhaMTk5Q3JSbXZyQ0JaSXlOSDJzYmUzUy1zaURLZTNrMVBmTEVSX0dzTkFCdE9VS3h0YlHSAbwBQVVfeXFMTVhnWVlDNjI4YXVnenB0a2N3WjRTTm12dGxmSEhUdnN6NDVxTjYxTGlERmxKWi1vU25CTTdNTVNKUnM2WXZQUUxYSlZRMnZVMHp6UE9YTkFENG1kd3RielVIdzZ4NDNyOE11b3Z0elV1NWoydXRPZkxZSmFYdmw2Rm9pSk93NlhEdTdiM2RqX3JuRTh5d3RFVVVsbTZ2bC0tS2FmRFlBSVpaOFYwTnBWOEo5TzFlZXUzbmRudEk</guid></item><item><title>与50岁以下女性结直肠癌风险相关的超加工食品-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/well/eat/ultraprocessed-foods-colorectal-cancer-risk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:03:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQR3ljLWJwN3RyMUNfX2dCY3FPYXl0Z0R3dFo2YXlCMkMxcVZtelVWbmJ3eDJOQkc2M3J6NTlJNGdPZWVVQmFpbXVQbjFHNGZmTGw4Q3pQRWI2SWx2QjFIOGJoQWxPRFNibDNndGdEODdMTnVfNWRuUkhLQnpnMnJtME1mNUFfNnNqRUZBSEZKT3ZONmVsb3RJ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，超加工食品与癌前息肉风险增加有关- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/ultra-processed-foods-linked-increased-risk-precancerous-polyps-study-rcna243574</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-773049" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating more ultra-processed foods is tied to an increased risk of precancerous colorectal growths in women under 50, according to a study published Thursday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2841354" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16832d" class="body-graf"&gt;These growths, called adenomas or polyps, can later turn into cancer and are a good indicator of a person’s cancer risk, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a060b" class="body-graf"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in people under 50 have risen sharply in recent decades. The findings could offer new insights into what’s driving this increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36e5c2" class="body-graf"&gt;“One approach we’ve been taking is trying to understand what has changed in our environment that could be driving this. What are some trends that mirror this acceleration in cancer rates?” said study leader Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist and the chief of the clinical and translational epidemiology unit at Massachusetts General Brigham in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-845e9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultra-processed foods now &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ultra-processed-foods-make-majority-kids-diet-cdc-report-finds-rcna223481" target="_blank"&gt;make up the bulk&lt;/a&gt; of the average American’s diet, especially among kids. The foods, which tend to be high in calories, have been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/ultraprocessed-foods-linked-depression-study-finds-rcna106811" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/eating-food-additives-together-may-increase-diabetes-risk-study-sugges-rcna200163" target="_blank"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/highly-processed-food-linked-early-death-study-rcna55455" target="_blank"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;. Some experts have also suspected eating these foods could be driving the increase in colorectal cancer rates among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e8cef" class="body-graf"&gt;To test this hypothesis, Chan and his team used data from more than 29,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study II, an ongoing study of female registered nurses established in 1989. The women, who were between 24 and 42 when they enrolled in the study, were followed for 24 years, from 1991 through 2015. Every four years, everyone filled out a questionnaire about their diets, and everyone had at least one colonoscopy before 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5dd606" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers looked at whether the women were diagnosed with precancerous polyps: either adenomas, which are more likely to turn into cancer, or serrated lesions. While only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, about 75% of colorectal cancers start as adenomas, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15370-colon-polyps" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Serrated lesions are still considered precancerous but are linked to fewer cases of colorectal cancer, Chan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e0b99" class="body-graf"&gt;The study found a connection between eating more ultra-processed foods and developing an adenoma before 50. It didn’t see any links between the foods and serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c85a4" class="body-graf"&gt;Because the majority of colon cancers arise from adenomas, the study showing  a link between eating more ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of developing adenomas specifically gave Chan and his team more confidence that these foods could increase colorectal cancer risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fd075" class="body-graf"&gt;“The strength was that we looked at two major types of polyps — it’s the adenoma type that seems to underlie cancer, and we saw the link between that,” he said. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b604a5" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1,200 women in the study developed adenomas. Compared to those who ate the fewest ultra-processed foods, those who ate the most — accounting for one-third of their daily calories — were about 1.5 times more likely to develop adenomas. Specific foods also appeared to increase risk. Diets higher in sugar and artificial sweeteners were most linked to higher rates of adenomas, followed by diets high in sauces, spreads and condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f02b73" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the study included only women, the majority of whom were white, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evidence-links-highly-processed-food-cancer-death-rcna45713" target="_blank"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found a link between men eating more ultra-processed foods and developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-477138" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t have any reason to believe there would be a difference in men compared to women,” Chan said, adding that additional research should include men to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-458f5f" class="body-graf"&gt;Most colorectal polyps do not turn into cancer, but nearly all colorectal cancer does start as a polyp, said Dr. Folasade May, a gastroenterologist and an associate professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50622b" class="body-graf"&gt;This is why doctors remove any polyps they find during a colonoscopy, and why people who have polyps are considered to be at higher risk for developing colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c7b04" class="body-graf"&gt;“They are looking at the first step, who is more likely to get these polyps that can turn into cancer,” May said of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc08bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The problem is that routine screening for colorectal cancer does not happen until age 45, said Dr. Christopher Lieu, the co-director of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine in Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24e303" class="body-graf"&gt;“The concern is that whenever you have a polyp in a young person, that polyp is allowed to grow unnoticed, and because you are not screening those young patients,” Lieu said. This makes it even more important to identify the modifiable lifestyle factors that are driving increased rates of colorectal cancer in young people, added Lieu, who wasn’t involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33c0a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Although scientists have yet to determine a clear cause, the rise in rates is unlikely to be driven by genetics, May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dcf61" class="body-graf"&gt;“This has happened very fast, so it is likely unfortunately something we have done to ourselves as humans, in the way we live our lives,” she said. “It’s jarring, hearing stories every week about people in their 20s, 30s, 40s getting cancers that, when I was in medical school, we were taught happen in people in their 80s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40e10b" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultra-processed foods cause inflammation in the gut — which includes the colon — that impairs the gut’s ability to repair itself when damaged and keep tumors at bay. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-inflammatory-diet-may-help-colon-cancer-patients-live-longer-stud-rcna209539" target="_blank"&gt;High levels of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; are also linked to cancer in general, May said. Another hypothesis is that people who eat more ultra-processed foods are more likely to have obesity and Type 2 diabetes, both which are linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/obesity.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a6bbe" class="body-graf"&gt;“More likely, it’s the direct toxic effects of these ultra-processed foods,” May said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c1effe" class="body-graf"&gt;Chan, the study author, said ultra-processed foods are known to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-dna-damage-gut-toxin-antibiotics-rcna202572" target="_blank"&gt;alter the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which, in theory, could make cells in the gut more likely to turn cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96dcf8" class="body-graf"&gt;The next step in the research is determining whether any of these hypotheses appear to have a causal effect on who develops colorectal cancer at a young age. It’s likely part of the puzzle, Chan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e19e06" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“One thing that has been clear is that the U.S. intake of ultra-processed food has really risen in the past few decades in a way that mirrors the staggering increase in colorectal cancer cases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 16:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPZ2YxYW5ncG9GUEREbzVTNTcyMXdiMXFXTnMzd3MtamdJTlVPc19pZU5HbTJfREluV2dpclZJSWJCVWxPdm1ZNzRrWU94ejROZlpVRzBKX2pHWWdFTzdMSGFXVl9vSG9aVDlZTFVwRlBpTG9lVVVYem5fMk9HZDVIQVZzdkt0SHFHM2JZRE5BRkxzRVVZUURjTFJuN0RYZVFsWER6VWUtRnBwcXVmSVJBQUlqNTRTZ09kY3fSAVZBVV95cUxNSmJ3U2xHamhtRHZqRzB1ei1UUnpHX3dQdWxjQXNUN0lkS0FuWHNwS0tEVm1aWkozaWxsc19iMkdXQnZvTGlDc3Rra3Yya1VIZFM4NDF6QQ</guid></item><item><title>妈妈分享了她在乳腺癌诊断前几个月出现的“疯狂和令人兴奋”的症状- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/mom-shares-crazy-mind-blowing-213032138.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Kelly Mann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann started experiencing recurring pink eye infections in April 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and later learned that her eye symptoms were actually episcleritis, a condition triggered by the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of three is now using her platform to raise awareness and share her breast cancer journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman is recalling the “mind-blowing” symptom she experienced months before she was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kellymann/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kelly Mann;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kelly Mann&lt;/a&gt;, a university professor from Abilene, Texas, started suffering from “the worst pink eye of my life,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-symptom-pink-eye-episcleritis-rcna243059" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY&lt;/a&gt;. Antibiotic eye drops wouldn’t relieve the redness in her eyes, but after a week, the issue resolved itself. Her symptoms were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the pink eye returned, beginning a cycle that occurred six times between April and June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then one night while watching TV, I went to itch my arm and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/pictures-of-breast-cancer-lumps-signs-rcna53603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:felt a lump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;felt a lump&lt;/a&gt;," she recalled.

After a mammogram and biopsy, she received life-changing news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July 2023, Mann was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, just a week before her 36th birthday. Mann was devastated by the discovery, especially because she had a breast exam just in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was, obviously, devastated," she told the outlet. "My tumor grew from being completely undetectable to 2 and a half centimeters in about six to eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a few weeks, Mann started chemotherapy treatment, which led to a “crazy” realization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After my first chemo, I had the same pink eye situation pop up again," she said.

While there is no known cause, it can be associated with an underlying inflammatory or rheumatologic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your eye, being an organ, will respond in unique ways to things happening in your body," Mann explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Episcleritis was my &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-symptoms-doctor-monitors-in-herself-rcna234706" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first real, tangible symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;first real, tangible symptom&lt;/a&gt; that I had," she said. "I thought it was fascinating and also crazy and mind-blowing that your body really does know what’s going on far before any normal diagnostics could make sense of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann, now 38, was given steroid eye drops to help manage her symptoms moving forward. She underwent 12 rounds of chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery. The mom of three then continued a number of breast cancer therapies through October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly Mann/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Kelly Mann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann admitted that her treatment journey has been difficult and she still sporadically deals with episcleritis, but because of her children — "three little souls watching me and worried about me" — she wouldn’t allow herself to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a cancer survivor, Mann is using her social media platform to share her journey and raise awareness for episcleritis and early detection. She admitted that building a community online has helped her connect with so many young patients like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes I’m the first person they told, or it’s their caregivers that are reaching out to me," she told TODAY.

Previously, diabetes was considered a middle-aged or older-age condition, but lately, India's younger generations, both teenagers and young adults, are widely affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Abhinav Kumar Gupta, senior consultant- endocrinology and diabetes, Narayana Hospital in Jaipur, told us that n&lt;span&gt;ew cases are appearing in people as young as 20 and 35 years of age. This sheds light on how alarming the situation has become. Lifestyle and genetic factors are contributors to the risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/obesity-reversal-specialist-shares-the-number-1-exercise-mistake-women-should-avoid-when-trying-to-lose-weight-101762933055352.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Obesity"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; emerges as one of the major risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Young adults are also busy professionals, as the doctor noted, who may often skip exercise and follow a poor diet. This imbalance worsens early diabetes. He asserted that diabetes sometimes stays silent, which is 'scarier.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Gupta suggested some early signs which many people may overlook, “&lt;span&gt;Most of the time, young people with diabetes don't even know they have it until a check-up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Sometimes, there are small clues like dark skin on their neck, being super tired, cuts that won't heal, or being really thirsty, but people usually ignore them until their blood sugar is through the roof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The endocrinologist also warned that when diabetes is not regulated, one may see common complications such as e&lt;span&gt;ye damage, nerve issues causing tingling in the feet, and kidney problems. He urged reducing carbohydrates and excessive fats from the diet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Healthy swaps in Indian meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/03/original/brown_rice12_1751528322960.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Brown rice is a healthier alternative.(Freepik)" title="Brown rice is a healthier alternative.(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Brown rice is a healthier alternative.(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lifestyle coach Nidhi Nahata, founder of Justbe, shared that simple tweaks to traditional dishes with healthier alternatives help in bringing about balanced blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She revealed these healthy, diabetes-friendly swaps:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Replace white rice with millets or brown rice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Refined rice loses fibre, hence quicker blood sugar peaks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brown rice, foxtail millet, or red rice sustains hunger longer and allows sugar to be released gradually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Replace deep-fried snacks with roasted or steamed options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of fried snacks, opt for roasted chana, puffy rice bhel, or homemade dhokla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;It aids digestion and prevents after-dinner drowsiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Exchange polished flour rotis with whole-grain or mixed-flour ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rotis made from jowar, ragi, or bajra aid in stabilising blood sugar and offer regular energy all day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Avoid creamy sauces, and go for nut or seed-based sauces&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stay away from curries heavy in butter or cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, add cashew, sesame, or pumpkin seed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Go for natural sweets over artificially made ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use mashed dates, ripe banana, or grated apple to sweeten your food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of empty calories, they give fibre and minerals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/endocrinologist-shares-3-healthy-foods-that-spike-blood-sugar-levels-faster-than-a-chocolate-cake-101760962447599.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Endocrinologist shares 3 'healthy' foods that spike blood sugar levels faster than a chocolate cake"&gt;Endocrinologist shares 3 'healthy' foods that spike blood sugar levels faster than a chocolate cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

By the National Institutes of Health’s newest count there are about &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-symptoms-rheumatology-diagnosis-steps-ecc5981788b598fe08d2c19a0fa1523b"&gt;140 autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; affecting tens of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

                    &lt;blockquote&gt;I’ve always been a person who loves puzzles and problem solving and the big picture of how people get sick. What I’m explaining to my family is that I’m a gene hunter. I could do back flips, inside that’s how I feel when I can see something new. It’s amazing. What I am studying, I feel it’s a super exciting moment to be doing this.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unraveling them requires patience, persistence — and sophisticated technology to even see the suspects. Researchers use laser-powered machinery and brightly colored fluorescent dyes to tell rogue cells from normal ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Type 1 diabetes, caused when cells in the pancreas that produce insulin are gradually killed off by rogue T cells. In a biomedical engineering lab at Johns Hopkins University, researchers examine mouse pancreas cells on a computer screen. Red marks the killer cells. In yellow are “peacemaker” cells that are supposed to tamp down autoimmune reactions – but they’re outnumbered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-fullwidth&gt;

It’s small baby steps that then amount to big steps. The field that I work in has moved quite fast. I think it’s really exciting seeing what’s coming out.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another type of immune cell, B cells, drive autoimmune diseases by producing antibodies that mistake healthy tissue for foreign invaders. At NIH, Dr. Iago Pinal-Fernandez studies myositis, a poorly understood group of muscle-weakening diseases. His research shows rogue antibodies don’t just damage muscles by latching onto their surface. They can sneak inside muscle cells and disrupt their normal functions in ways that help explain varying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

            &lt;div class="PullQuote-content"&gt;

                
                    &lt;blockquote&gt;When I started, nothing was known about the type of autoimmune disease we study. Now finally we’re able to tell patients, ‘You have this disease and this is the mechanism of disease. And this is the reason why we’re treating you – because the disease works in this way.’”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s drugs tamp down symptoms but don’t correct the problem. Now in early-phase clinical trials are treatments that instead aim to fix dysfunctional immune pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Hopkins, scientists are working on next-generation versions, not yet ready to try in people. In one lab, they’re developing nanoparticle-based treatment to dial down pancreas-killing cells in Type 1 diabetes and ramp up “peacemaker” cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in another Hopkins lab, researchers are developing what they hope will become more precise treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other antibody-driven illnesses – drugs that search out and destroy “bad” B cells.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:latest study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; under that umbrella examines people who took less than 8,000 daily steps, &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;they took them (in short or long bursts?), and what that cadence meant for cardiovascular health. Ultimately, researchers found that walking in longer bouts significantly cut cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center; and &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City and LabFinder contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, cardiologists explain the conclusions and attempt to settle the step saga—as it pertains to heart health, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at accelerometer (step counter) data from 33, 560 people in the United Kingdom who took 8,000 or fewer daily steps and were initially free of cardiovascular disease or cancer. They were categorized into sedentary participants (who had fewer than 5,000 daily steps) and low-active participants (who had 5,000 to 7,999 daily steps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an average of 7.9 years, researchers tracked participants’ health and learned that people who took most of their daily steps in longer bouts (between 10 and 15 minutes at a time) had lower all-cause death rates and lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to those who took their steps in shorter durations. Those conclusions were “much more prominent in the sedentary group,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most studies, this one has its limitations. The findings are observational and also contain implicit bias, as people who tend to take longer walks may also make healthier choices, notes &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/mary-greene-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Greene, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Greene, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology in New York City and LabFinder contributor. However, the findings do suggest that sustained activity over 10 or more minutes “may be necessary to stimulate the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of activity that doesn’t occur in five minutes or less,” explains Dr. Greene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly: “This research further emphasizes the danger of sedentary behavior,” says Dr. Berg. “It also suggests that the spacing of activity, even in those who are very sedentary, is related to the degree of cardiovascular risk.” &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why longer walks work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Longer or more continuous walking raises your heart rate and cardiac output in a more sustained way, which trains the heart and improves cardiovascular fitness more so than small bursts of activity,” explains Dr. Greene. “This sustained activity also improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in study participants, which can reduce cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes and atherosclerotic [artery] disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What advice is right?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking, what about “exercise snacks,” or past research that says even short, small bursts of activity are helpful? Well, those aren’t necessarily wrong. “Both ‘exercise snacks’ and sustained activity are good for health. Something is always better than nothing,” says Dr. Greene. “Sustained activity is better, adding ‘snacks’ to a regimen of sustained activity is best!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important message to take away from these findings is that taking less than 4,000 daily steps is “detrimental,” Dr. Greene notes. And, if you can get in at least around 7,000, that appears to be the well-studied, average on-ramp to cardiovascular benefits, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is, the longer bouts of activity that this research suggests won’t “happen by accident” and will likely take some planning, Dr. Berg notes. “This may mean scheduling 10 minutes to walk with a co-worker during lunch or incorporating a walk as part of a daily routine,” he adds. You can even intentionally take the longer route to get somewhere, or park further out in a parking lot. “Write it down in your calendar and hold yourself to it,” Dr. Berg continues. “Couple it to something enjoyable to make it more attractive—walk to your favorite coffee shop or call your best friend.” And if you miss a day, don’t let it set you back and squeeze in some steps where you can. “Anything is better than nothing,” Dr. Berg concludes.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;If you are sedentary, start slow with a general increase in activity,” like taking the stairs, recommends Dr. Greene. “Start to aim for at least 7,000 steps per day. As you build up endurance, then start sustained walking sessions with a pace that is comfortably uncomfortable.” In other words, do your best to get your heart rate up, and work your way up to 10 minutes of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can, add some resistance training and/or body weight exercises as well, which can also provide other health benefits,” says Dr. Greene. “As with anything, consistency is key! It’s more important to be consistent with moving your body than it is to be perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:37:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQaVlDR0prVWl0ZWJkc0VGTzlYMVR0RVg3NnFzTXNZWF8tSE1JLXRNNTlvRnpfdTRjVzItQ0NNaWVic3lsbUJQRXF3bkZaZHJkZ1NlMFlhVnh0VHJtVzF3T1FXTm9LZ1I4NGxvaGx1UVd1QWZlZEtNbm9VNTdFY3J2M1BOV05EU2RIQWxuVWJ6bVU</guid></item><item><title>不是有氧运动，但这对大脑来说是最好的运动，甚至可以减缓认知衰退， lon说-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/not-cardio-but-this-is-the-best-exercise-for-the-brain-and-can-even-slow-down-cognitive-decay-says-longevity-expert/articleshow/125297836.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that just like our bodies, our brains need exercise too. And when it comes to cognitive decline, aerobic exercise, also known as cardio has been considered the ‘gold standard’ to keep it at bay. However, it turns out that it might not be the case. Aerobic exercise, while excellent otherwise, might lag behind when it comes to cognitive sharpness. So, which exercise is the magic pill, really? Turns out, it is resistance training. A growing body of research is highlighting resistance training, whether through weight‑lifting or other strength‑building routines, as a boost for brain health and memory. Austin Perlmutter, MD, and longevity expert reveals more…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fresh evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the go‑to brain‑health tip has been cardio-walking, running, cycling-because those moves boost heart function, and increase blood flow to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately though, research is shedding light on another kind of exercise: resistance training, whether it means lifting dumbbells, or pulling on bands, seems to have a stronger effect on memory and cognition, especially in older adults and people showing early signs of cognitive decline. Recognising this shift, gives us a chance to keep our brains protected, as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Daily habits to follow every night for a sharper brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How resistance training helps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimer-europe.org/news/recent-study-demonstrates-resistance-training-preserves-white-brain-matter-adults-mci?language_content_entity=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have shown that resistance training enhances memory, attention and decision‑making abilities effectively, more than, or at least on par with, regular exercise. In a landmark randomised controlled trial, older women who performed one or two sessions of resistance training per week, exhibited notable improvements in selective attention and conflict resolution, core components of executive cognition. A separate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1131214/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; of adults with cognitive impairment revealed that resistance training helped preserve brain volume in memory‑critical regions such as the hippocampus, thereby slowing the pace of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are important, because cognitive impairment currently responds poorly to medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why hitting the weights could be your brain’s best friend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight‑lifting kicks off the release of chemicals such, as neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin‑like growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1), both of which nurture the growth and repair of neurons. At the same time, it tampers down inflammation, and helps sweep away the toxic protein clumps linked to Alzheimer’s. By building muscle resistance workouts, it also increases blood flow to the brain, which in turn protects brain tissue and prevents the shrinkage of memory‑related regions. In short strengthening muscles, seems to broadcast the right signals to the brain, making resistance training a form of brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Even helpful in those already diagnosed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training isn’t just a preventive measure; it can actually sharpen memory even in individuals already showing signs of cognitive decline. In studies of older adults with cognitive impairment, just a few months of resistance work has been linked to noticeable gains in both memory, and verbal fluency. The exercise appears to shield brain regions from degeneration, offering a drug‑free way to slow dementia’s progression. For patients and the people who care for them, this represents an uplifting discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Mixing up with cardio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though resistance training is finally getting its due, pairing it with cardio work appears to be the ideal brain‑boosting combo. A handful of studies have reported that people who mix weight‑lifting with cardio, experience improved memory and clearer thinking, than those who stick to cardio alone. Cardio revs up the heart and lungs, while strength work builds muscle, and nudges the brain’s repair systems. So a balanced routine that blends both seems the perfect bet for keeping the brain in shape as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to start strength training&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a resistance‑training routine can be straightforward and safe, for most adults. Some simple exercises can be done at home, using body weights, a set of resistance bands or a few light dumbbells. Focus on the core muscle groups-legs, arms, back and core. Try to fit in two moderate‑intensity resistance sessions each week, gradually increasing the weight or resistance, as strength improves. If you have underlying health conditions, it’s wise to consult a trainer or healthcare professional before beginning. Remember, consistency is essential for gaining all the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwJBVV95cUxNaWRkY3NVVHBqSmlGbmREQm5NV2JHdVkyOFNESlNuUVl1UmFXV1I4U0FtaXB4QnRMdFVWUlRHNWQzSTE2a0NWbmd6S1BDQm40YXhfdmdPc01tLUxjYVFoaUJPdmRwbzFiM0xKZU9DUFpOY3c3cjdVVUY1MWc5MWxVUFYydXRwa2ZjUXdla0pnQ09sMklEUkQ4MHNabm1xSzJGekhIN1ZRWVh6NHZ5YUFrM25GX0VoOHh1cHVLVWlONUZwRjFob0dfTjItRDBWZDlURzN2V2ZpSW9icFdTZVZVVHp6NFJibkhMYUNhODNHX1VkNVlFSTduRHI3cGpJOUFvZ3BRVVB3Ny03N1JDLVJ1Ykl5NjRsM2hoazFoSXk0dlJVZVR5WmoxNEpIWQ</guid></item><item><title>几十年后，科学家终于发现了泰诺的秘密机制- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/after-decades-scientists-have-finally-discovered-tylenols-secret-mechanism/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:08:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPa2lKb090VUpEeGdjZWtNWHE3WVBxNUNMZFlhdGpBZkhkWkItQVRiQmZPQVVpSk5FQWxqZU1XVEk2STBfenlTbjUwd1RkREE2TkNsRmpTdkRSRVo5d21mZi16bjZJQzJPOVdnWGhfQll3eEMtU3lNLUtDNGFLb1g3UnVKRTMzaGdPQnItcEtUVTBnVTdaaVE1TE9IbzVROU1XTVE</guid></item><item><title>锰是莱姆病的双刃剑- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-11-manganese-lyme-disease-edge-sword.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising—and ironic—vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm B. burgdorferi, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/new+therapeutic+strategies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;new therapeutic strategies&lt;/a&gt; for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield B. burgdorferi against its host's immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If B. burgdorferi is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host's immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;i&gt;mBio&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease," said Northwestern's Brian Hoffman, who co-led the study with USU's Michael Daly. "It's both Borrelia's armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors to entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/molecular+biosciences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular biosciences&lt;/a&gt; at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 476,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although antibiotics harm B. burgdorferi, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria," Daly said. "Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and—if not treated promptly—can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient's immune, circulatory and central nervous systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-12-conan-bacterium-combines-simple-metabolites.html"&gt;understand the role of manganese&lt;/a&gt; in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as "Conan the Bacterium" for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in B. burgdorferi's defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The "map" revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host's immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens," Hoffman said. "Without these tools, B. burgdorferi's defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese—to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave B. burgdorferi wide open to attack by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By disrupting the delicate balance of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/manganese/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;manganese&lt;/a&gt; in B. burgdorferi, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection," Daly said. "Manganese is an Achilles' heel of its defenses."&lt;/p&gt;
