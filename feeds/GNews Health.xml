Five deaths have also been reported. Both Nassau and Lee County have recorded no fatalities this year. Lee has registered four cases, while Nassau has only registered one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, at least 72 cases have been recorded across 12 states in 2025, mostly in the South, although one infection was also reported as far north as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-a66f7670-d509-11f0-bb8f-917bb609b4fd"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana has seen a major uptick in Vibrio, with 26 infections and five deaths reported so far this year, well above the seven to 10 infections recorded annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio are bacteria that naturally live in coastal waters, but are found in higher numbers from May to October when water temperatures rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher, 49, caught Vibrio vulnificus after swimming at a beach off Florida's coast. She was hospitalized and doctors warned she was going into organ failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of an infection include skin redness or a rash that quickly becomes swollen or painful, fluid-filled blisters, fever, pain and an altered mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, patients may need to have limbs amputated or the bacteria can enter the blood and cause the life-threatening condition sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five people infected with the bacteria die from the disease, the CDC says, and about 80 percent are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with weakened immune systems, older adults or those eating raw seafood are most at risk for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida revealed the two new cases in an update to its statewide data on December 5, but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state health department warns online: 'Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria in warm, brackish water. Water and wounds do not mix. Do not enter the water if you have fresh cuts and scrapes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida's case and fatality tally from Vibrio is below last year's, when a total of 82 infections and 19 deaths were recorded. In 2023, the state registered 46 infections and 11 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the US recorded at least 82 cases and 19 deaths in 2024, also above the tally for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gallagher is pictured above before her infection, left, and while in the hospital. She believes the bacteria entered her left leg through an open cut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a previous case recorded in Florida this year, a 49-year-old woman nearly lost her life after she caught Vibrio while swimming in the sea off Pensacola Beach in July with her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher felt fine after the swim, but three days later her left leg began to swell and she developed agonizing blisters on its calf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to the ER where doctors diagnosed her with Vibrio, septic shock and warned that she was going into organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallagher told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/escambia-county/2025/09/03/vibro-bacteria-on-pensacola-beach-threatens-life-of-woman-after-swim/85830159007/"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt;: 'It feels like somebody took gasoline, poured it on my leg, and lit my leg on fire. That's what it feels like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just looking at my leg, it doesn't even look like my leg anymore. It looks deformed right now. The pain is unbelievable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallagher believes the bacteria entered her body through a 'small cut' on her left leg, which she said she had a waterproof bandage on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treated her by removing most of the muscle on her left leg up to the knee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ben West, 38, was diagnosed with Vibrio vulnificus, a severe bacterial infection that can cause kidney and liver failure. His fiancée, Jamie Knowles, took him to the hospital and has been caring for him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists are warning that Vibrio vulnificus cases have risen nationwide in recent years (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another previous case recorded in Florida this year, Albert Allison, 88, from Collier County, was infected with Vibrio after fishing from a dock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allison told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gulfcoastnewsnow.com/article/naples-flesh-bacteria-vibrio-fish-collier-county/66057247"&gt;Gulf Coast News Now&lt;/a&gt; that he never went into the water and was even wearing shoes, but the next day he noticed a bruise on the back of his calf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He put a bandage on it, but after the mark grew and turned a deep shade of purple, he went to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with Vibrio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allison&lt;span&gt; was treated with antibiotics. He added, however: 'I handled the fish, and they're wet and slimy. Any, you know, it's possible that I got slime and I scratched my leg. I mean, I don't remember. I'll never know.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To treat a Vibrio infection, doctors may use antibiotics, which can clear the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physicians may also drain fluid from blisters and provide intravenous fluids. In serious cases, affected limbs may need to be amputated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 18:01:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>生病时生个热辣的婴儿是个好主意吗？ -《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/09/is-hot-toddy-whiskey-remedy-good-when-sick</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The hot toddy has a reputation as a folk remedy for illness. And if you’re sick, a steaming cup of whiskey, honey, lemon, and water can sound like a lot more fun than crackers and broth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what about the alcohol? Here’s what experts say about hot toddies and colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-have-a-hot-toddy-when-im-sick" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I have a hot toddy when I’m sick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, it’s not a great idea, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients sometimes bring up hot toddies as a cold remedy, says Jesse Bracamonte, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Indeed, some of the ingredients can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hot fluids, honey, and a little bit of lemon can be very therapeutic in combating a respiratory infection,” says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But there’s an important exception: “I would never recommend having alcohol with any illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?","elementId":"59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/02/love-addiction-explained"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While drinking can cause a relaxing effect, consuming alcohol while sick can also overly sedate you, particularly if you’re taking cold and cough medications like Benadryl, Bracamonte says. Combining alcohol with medications that have sedative effects can &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/health-professionals-communities/core-resource-on-alcohol/alcohol-medication-interactions-potentially-dangerous-mixes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increase risks&lt;/a&gt; like falling and overdose, and change how you metabolize prescriptions – people over 65 need to be especially cautious because of their slower metabolism. (Even outside hot toddy season, it’s essential to chat with your doctor about potential alcohol-medication interactions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alcohol may also weaken the immune system and slow down healing, Bracamonte says. Furthermore, drinking can cause dehydration, worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The last thing you want to do when you have a cold is get dehydrated,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietician and clinical instructor at Boston University. “If you take in something that is going to dehydrate you, it’s sort of like filling a bucket with a hole in the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s also likely that if you’re not feeling well, you’re not eating much. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can cause blood sugar levels to drop, says Blake. Low blood sugar can lead to dizziness. In particular, people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic need to monitor their blood sugar, Blake explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-good-about-a-hot-toddy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s good about a hot toddy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you take the booze out of the equation, a non-alcoholic hot toddy could help with a cold, says Bracamonte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemon contains vitamin C, which can support the immune system, says Blake. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264544/#B133" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests consuming vitamin C may slightly shorten the duration of the common cold (though you would probably need to consume at least &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;200 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;; an orange has &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sources-of-vitamin-c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about 83 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4264806/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; honey can help reduce cough frequency and discomfort. “A little bit of honey for a cough goes a long way,” says Bracamonte. A small amount of sugar, like the amount in a dollop of honey, can provide some necessary energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hydration helps with illness, especially &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4022-upper-respiratory-infection" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;upper respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt; like colds, explains Bracamonte. Staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/five-ways-water-can-help-you-stay-healthy-1758946" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;helps your cells&lt;/a&gt; maintain a strong immune system, reduces the likelihood of headaches, and loosens mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-eat-or-drink-to-help-with-a-cold" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you eat or drink to help with a cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re intrigued by the idea of the hot toddy, Blake recommends adding ginger because of its anti-inflammatory components and swapping in apple cider to replace the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if you don’t have an appetite, it’s still important to consume a small amount of sugar, “so you can have some kind of fuel,” Blake explains. A Gatorade or its equivalent could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bracamonte also recommends chamomile tea as a soothing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for food, a 2010 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3023145/#abstract1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a 20% reduction in the number of days of moderate or severe common cold symptoms. Blake also recommends classic chicken noodle soup: It is hydrating and contains a healthy balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest, says Bracamonte. Colds usually last three to seven days; if your illness lasts longer than that or if you’re having difficulty breathing, you should contact your healthcare provider for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While sipping a hot toddy might sound like a bright reprieve from the monotony of feeling sick, it’s more useful to stick to the basics: sleep, eat healthy and keep those non-boozy liquids coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNd3lJcnpFeFY1MngyVkMwb3BpSXkwcFVsRWdlRHlrWTVONE0zWDRrVHNuUE9RenpQbWN1ZFNPZUh0aWxnVWtTZDAyVmZiVjg4U092NnVvejAxNVJkMkJwdlJhRmlGeEtkMXhQMm9FNTktaFNxaWFRb2hlVDNwWDFpbUdKSWdQNG53NWxaNThuVnk2Q3JZYWc</guid></item><item><title>官员告诉俄亥俄州学校像垃圾一样扔掉72只死秃鹰事实证明他们患有禽流感- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/officials-told-ohio-school-to-trash-72-dead-vultures-like-garbage-turns-out-they-had-bird-flu-2000697260</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An Ohio elementary school recently became the site of an animal massacre you’d expect to see at the start of a horror movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staff and students at St. Bernadette’s School in Clermont County discovered 72 dead vultures on campus after returning from the Thanksgiving holiday break. It took days and mounting media pressure before state wildlife officials responded to the school’s pleas and agreed to collect and test the potentially diseased carcasses. And as it turns out, some of the birds have since tested positive for avian influenza, though the risk of infection to the public is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Initially ignored&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The birds were found on campus December 1, according to local media outlet WCPO 9. School staff contacted the fire chief at Pierce Township, who reached out to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Despite the clear possible danger of bird flu, ODNR officials initially declined to help, saying it wasn’t part of the agency’s usual duties.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“They were very adamant that they were not coming. There was a recommendation that you just take them, put them in a bag, double-bag them and throw them in the garbage,” Pierce Township Trustee Allen Freeman &lt;a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/we-dont-know-why-the-birds-have-died-72-vultures-dead-at-clermont-county-school"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; WCPO 9. After WCPO 9’s investigative team contacted the ODNR about the situation, however, the agency changed its tune. Last Friday morning, wildlife officials arrived to collect the birds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bird die-offs can happen for various reasons, but one of the most concerning potential culprits is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI). Remarkably, though, the ODNR still wasn’t planning to test the collected birds for flu—at least initially.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In a statement to WCPO 9, an ODNR spokesperson said that since some wild birds in the county had earlier tested positive for HPAI, all subsequent large die-offs (six or more dead birds) are presumed to be carrying the disease. However, a spokesperson for Clermont County Public Health stated that the department would indeed arrange for the testing of two birds. On Monday, the results came back, showing a presumptive positive for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low risk, for now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a serious and growing public health threat. Experts worry that an HPAI strain can eventually evolve to spread widely between humans while causing severe illness—a combination ripe for causing the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This danger has become all the more present in the U.S. since last year, when a strain of H5N1 bird flu started to spread widely among dairy cows and other mammals. At least 71 people in the U.S. have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; H5N1 as well, while two are thought to have died from it. Just last month, a person in Washington exposed to wild birds and backyard chickens &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-human-dies-of-rare-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;also died&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu, albeit a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/first-ever-human-case-of-h5n5-bird-flu-found-in-washington-2000686941"&gt;different strain&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For now, human cases of H5N1 and other bird flu strains remain relatively rare, and the overall risk to the public is low. But the more people are exposed to infected wild birds or other carriers, the greater the chance that one day, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s all the more important to minimize these exposures as much as possible. And that’s also why it’s probably not the best idea to tell an elementary school that a bunch of dead birds isn’t a big deal to clean up on its own.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

He was soon hospitalized, ventilated and then died. Postmortem testing confirmed rabies, the CDC report said, baffling authorities because the recipient’s family had said he had not had any exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors then reviewed records about the kidney donor, a man in Idaho, and discovered that in the Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire he said he had been scratched by a skunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked, the family explained that a couple of months before, in October, while he was holding a kitten in a shed on his country property, a skunk approached, showing “predatory aggression toward the kitten”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man fought off the animal in an encounter that the report says “rendered the skunk unconscious”, but not before the man received a “shin scratch that bled”, although he did not think he had been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Five weeks later, a family member said, he became confused, had difficulty walking swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations and had a stiff neck. Two days later, he was found unresponsive at home after a presumed cardiac arrest. Although he was resuscitated and hospitalized, he never regained consciousness, and after several days was “declared brain dead and removed from life support”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report states that several of his organs, including his left kidney, were donated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, authorities went back to test laboratory samples from the donor; they tested negative for rabies. But biopsy samples directly from his kidneys did detect a strain “consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies”, suggesting that he had, in fact, died of rabies and had passed it on to the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The investigation suggested a “likely three-step transmission chain” in which a bat infected a skunk, which infected the donor, whose kidney then infected the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it was only the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978. It noted that the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After discovering that three people also received cornea grafts from the same donor, authorities immediately removed the grafts and administered Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection. The three people remained asymptomatic, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC report stated that in the US, family members often provide information about a prospective donor’s infectious disease risk factors, including animal exposures. Rabies is typically “excluded from routine donor pathogen testing because of its rarity in humans in the United States and the complexity of diagnostic testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In this case, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his pre-admission signs and symptoms to chronic co-morbidities,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/health/rabies-death-skunk-kidney-transplant.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lara Danziger-Isakov, the director of immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, described the incident as “an exceptionally rare event”, adding that “overall, the risk is exceptionally small”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWnhPUGlzVGYzT3Mycl8yYjFIWGYyODNseUxPdnhqMVFlLTZma0tXdDVqSC1UNnpnNi05d2VVSWZ1Um5DUUF6Z2FTUEVTemM5QzhOVkE4SXhZVEpicW5nbEZEU1pySzFWd2s0VG9uV0xqTmlOSkxMeHdlNkxLVENwRk1uZjd3NUk</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病正在上升。5个降低患病风险的专家提示- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/health/parkinson-risk-reduction-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The “Shaking Palsy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00073b6ndte7iusz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/jnp.14.2.223" target="_blank"&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/3/843/3053438" target="_blank"&gt;first to identify&lt;/a&gt; and document the condition now known as Parkinson’s disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00083b6n84got7ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter &lt;/a&gt;involved in our brain’s reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4084861/" target="_blank"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt; (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00093b6nljciy48p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/4/e095610" target="_blank"&gt;almost 12 million cases&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson’s is projected to &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj-2024-080952" target="_blank"&gt;top 25 million&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The disease not only &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-020-0117-1" target="_blank"&gt;substantially burdens&lt;/a&gt; the individual, but also their family, their community and society as a whole.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4917y00003b6nhus2wjdf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer’s disease — that should grab everybody’s attention,” neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000e3b6ncmjxtj6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parkinson’s disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a ways to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000f3b6n4ev6avjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn’t just a disease of dopamine; it isn’t just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs,” said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson’s Foundation. “So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000g3b6na3b4m2v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/advancing-research/our-research/pdgeneration/genetics-behind-pd" target="_blank"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11091623/" target="_blank"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt; — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114824/" target="_blank"&gt;the chemicals&lt;/a&gt; with which we regularly come in contact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don’t have to live in a world where we think it’s inevitable to get Parkinson’s,” Okun said. His latest book on the disease, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parkinsons-Plan-Path-Prevention-Treatment/dp/1541705386/" target="_blank"&gt;The Parkinson’s Plan&lt;/a&gt;: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment,” cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.29371" target="_blank"&gt;quietly assail&lt;/a&gt; our bodies.

            What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson’s? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000j3b6nu10wfo7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invest in a carbon water filter for your kitchen sink, Okun said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000k3b6nm4gw6nkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A simple carbon filter can reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/camp-lejeune/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/lejeune/background.html" target="_blank"&gt;invisible toxicants&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186205/" target="_blank"&gt;sneak into drinking water&lt;/a&gt; and may stress vulnerable brain systems,” he said. “Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000l3b6nog29wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7941732/" target="_blank"&gt;trichlorethylene, or TCE&lt;/a&gt;, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost &lt;a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/landmark-victory-parkinsons-community-epa-bans-trichloroethylene" target="_blank"&gt;complete ban of TCE&lt;/a&gt;, but lawsuits have so far &lt;a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/27607-epa-further-delays-provisions-of-trichloroethylene-ban" target="_blank"&gt;stayed the &lt;/a&gt;rule’s effective start date under certain circumstances.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000m3b6nsr2a6ke7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Use air purifiers both at home and work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000n3b6n0arhq5wz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Removing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8583112/" target="_blank"&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/a&gt; from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson’s,” Okun said. “Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain’s front door.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000o3b6n6dg8yoi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality#:~:text=Volatile%20organic%20compounds%20(VOCs)%20are,cosmetic%2C%20degreasing%20and%20hobby%20products." target="_blank"&gt;Volatile organic compounds are gases&lt;/a&gt; that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000q3b6n5lrdygad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Take the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000r3b6nn4d2ajsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time,” Okun noted. “This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000s3b6nnkhnn86p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiy4e2eh00133b6nzqluc9bf@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="keep-your-body-moving" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Keep your body moving

            Exercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000v3b6n87p5vvmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (~7000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day,” Okun said via email. “Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000w3b6nlbochgs9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000x3b6n8cnrfv9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000y3b6nb3r3vmm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Deep sleep activates the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;brain’s built-in cleaning system&lt;/a&gt;, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day,” Okun said. “Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson’s.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000z3b6n10xbzrop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson’s Disease ; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/ancient-roman-concrete-could-self-heal-thanks-to-hot-mixing-with-quicklime/"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; on MIT scientists’ conclusion that the ancient Romans employed “hot mixing” with quicklime, among other strategies, to make their famous concrete, giving the material self-healing functionality. The only snag was that this didn’t match the recipe as described in historical texts. Now the same team is back with a fresh analysis of samples collected from a recently discovered site that confirms the Romans did indeed use hot mixing, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/noblewomans-tomb-reveals-new-secrets-of-ancient-romes-highly-durable-concrete/"&gt;reported previously&lt;/a&gt;, like today’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement" data-uri="7e5fcbf7f79050078486c69c2a8120d1"&gt;Portland cement&lt;/a&gt; (a basic ingredient of modern concrete), ancient &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete" data-uri="57459e017b35b6cdf856f9fbc4b450d3"&gt;Roman concrete&lt;/a&gt; was basically a mix of a semi-liquid mortar and aggregate. Portland cement is typically made by heating limestone and clay (as well as sandstone, ash, chalk, and iron) in a kiln. The resulting clinker is then ground into a fine powder with just a touch of added gypsum to achieve a smooth, flat surface. But the aggregate used to make Roman concrete was made up of fist-sized pieces of stone or bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his treatise &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_architectura" data-uri="eea6afa7452c7f0ebb23ac2d0cb07a89"&gt;&lt;em&gt;De architectura&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (circa 30 CE), the Roman architect and engineer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius" data-uri="3509522d11f467111a16bc495afbaac9"&gt;Vitruvius&lt;/a&gt; wrote about how to build concrete walls for funerary structures that could endure for a long time without falling into ruin. He recommended the walls be at least two feet thick, made of either “squared red stone or of brick or lava laid in courses.” The brick or volcanic rock aggregate should be bound with mortar composed of hydrated lime and porous fragments of glass and crystals from volcanic eruptions (known as volcanic tephra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admir Masic, an environmental engineer at MIT, has studied ancient Roman concrete for several years. For instance, in 2019, Masic helped pioneer a new set of tools for analyzing Roman concrete samples from Privernum at multiple length scales—notably, Raman spectroscopy for chemical profiling and multi-detector energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for phase mapping the material. Masic was also a co-author of a &lt;a href="https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jace.18133"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; analyzing samples of the ancient concrete used to build a 2,000-year-old mausoleum along the Appian Way in Rome known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Caecilia_Metella" data-uri="a1e0e058f4d17139857bbc00170dfbdb"&gt;Tomb of Caecilia Metella&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman who lived in the first century CE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2023, Masic’s group analyzed samples taken from the concrete walls of the Privernum, focusing on strange white mineral chunks known as “lime clasts,” which others had largely dismissed as resulting from subpar raw materials or poor mixing. Masic et al. &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602"&gt;concluded that&lt;/a&gt; was not the case. Rather, the Romans deliberately employed “hot mixing” with quicklime that gave the material self-healing functionality. When cracks begin to form in the concrete, they are more likely to move through the lime clasts. The clasts can then react with water, producing a solution saturated with calcium. That solution can either recrystallize as calcium carbonate to fill the cracks or react with the pozzolanic components to strengthen the composite material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="8e865027-b6bc-4a71-bca7-115096375383"&gt;New research in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842444" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that more parents are opting out of giving their babies a recommended vitamin K shot at birth. And that puts babies at risk, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know unequivocally that infants that don't receive vitamin K are at significantly higher risk of getting serious bleeding," the lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vitamin-k-shot-given-at-birth-prevents-lethal-brain-bleeds-but-more-parents/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;told Scientific American&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All newborns are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Administration-of-Vitamin-K.aspx" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended to receive an injection of vitamin K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that helps the body form blood clots. Older children and adults get vitamin K from their diets and their gut microbiomes, but babies are born with very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutrient doesn't easily pass through the placenta and babies' microbiomes are too immature to make it; breast milk also contains relatively little vitamin K, and regardless, vitamin K given to babies by mouth isn't absorbed well. That means babies are vulnerable to vitamin K deficiency, which can lead to dangerous bleeding, and in turn, permanent brain damage or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one-time vitamin K shot protects babies from this deficiency extremely effectively and safely. Since universal administration of the vitamin was started in 1961, the U.S. has "nearly eliminated" vitamin K deficiency bleeding. But now, our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article-abstract/10/3/286/26024/Refusal-of-Intramuscular-Vitamin-K-by-Parents-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;numbers are slipping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JAMA analysis found that, between 2017 and 2024, the rate of vitamin K shot refusal has risen nearly 80%, with the proportion of newborns not given the shot rising from 2.92% to 5.18%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I've seen my share of breathless, online influencers spreading misinformation about vitamin K shots. Their efforts are closely tied to — if not indistinguishable from — the anti-vaccine movement, despite vitamin K shots not being vaccines. Often, the influencers promote unproven alternatives to the shot, which they personally happen to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to put it plainly: when vitamin K administration goes down, the rate of babies dying goes up. The new JAMA study calls attention to that disturbing trend.

&lt;p id="7d6e94ff-9c25-4805-a9a3-20a037767839"&gt;Comet 3I/ATLAS has been viewed through an X-ray space telescope for the first time, revealing an X-ray glow stretching about 250,000 miles (400,000 kilometers) around the interstellar visitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time researchers have been able to detect X-rays emanating from an interstellar comet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comet was observed as part of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xrism.jaxa.jp/en/project/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (XRISM), a collaboration between the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers across the globe are scrambling to learn all they can about comet 3I/ATLAS before this rare interstellar visitor exits our solar system next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5ef6da5b-e0d9-433a-8ec2-24b2a863a3d9"&gt;XRISM observed comet 3I/ATLAS between Nov. 26 and Nov. 28, just as the comet moved far enough away from the sun to be visible to the telescope’s instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Comets are enveloped by clouds of gas produced as sunlight heats and vaporizes their icy surfaces," XRISM representatives wrote in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xrism.jaxa.jp/en/topics/news/1208/" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "When this gas interacts with the energetic stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun — the solar wind — a process called charge-exchange reaction occurs, producing characteristic X-ray emission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the glow in the X-ray image as a "faint emission structure" and said it was potentially the result of a diffuse cloud of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also noted that instrumental effects such as vignetting or detector noise can create similar structures in images, so they'll have to do follow-up analysis to confirm whether the extensive emission structure belongs to the comet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Moving forward, the XRISM team will continue refining its data processing and analysis to further reveal the activity of this interstellar comet and the nature of its interaction with the solar wind," the representatives wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ac4e2500-487a-4ec7-9a67-9aaec035f2c9"&gt;2025 is set to tie for the second-warmest year on record, the European Union's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Copernicus Climate Change Service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November, this year is tied with 2023 for annual global surface temperature, but the temperature is slightly cooler than it was in 2024, the warmest year on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest data suggests that next month we'll be able to say that the last three years were the warmest on record — an ominous consequence of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measure global temperature rise above the estimated average temperature between 1850 and 1900, known as pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World leaders promised to limit this warming to preferably below 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) and well below 3.6 F (2 C) in the 2015 Paris Agreement, adopted at the United Nations' COP21 climate conference. Unfortunately, they're failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0eef2021-c354-400a-95af-fb3eb74d1e70"&gt;"For November, global temperatures were 1.54 C above pre-industrial levels, and the three-year average for 2023–2025 is on track to exceed 1.5 C for the first time," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/samantha-burgess" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Samantha Burgess&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the strategic lead for climate at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which implements the Copernicus program, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2025-course-be-joint-second-warmest-year-november-third-warmest-record" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These milestones are not abstract — they reflect the accelerating pace of climate change and the only way to mitigate future rising temperatures is to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Burgess added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth remembering that last month, climate deliberations at the COP30 conference in Brazil ended in an underwhelming compromise. The final text of the COP30 agreement didn't contain any &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/roadmaps-adaptations-and-transitions-what-climate-measures-were-agreed-at-cop30" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clear mention of fossil fuels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are the primary source of increased greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1dbf24f0-316b-4855-aaaa-d13a4857b5bb"&gt;A Herculean effort to search for dark matter has found no evidence for the elusive substance. That's the takeaway from a gigantic particle detector located a mile underground in South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 417-day-long experiment, known as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), looked at the light signatures released as particles collide with xenon atoms in a giant vat, which is placed deep underground so that most particles from space cannot muddy the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark matter, which emits no light yet exerts gravitational force, is thought to make up most of the universe. And the new findings tightly constrain the properties of one the leading candidates for dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read all about why scientists are actually happy about these negative results in contributor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/author/elizabeth-howell" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/author/elizabeth-howell"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elizabeth Howell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/particle-physics/historic-search-for-huge-missing-piece-of-the-universe-turns-up-negative-but-reveals-new-secrets-of-particle-physics" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/particle-physics/historic-search-for-huge-missing-piece-of-the-universe-turns-up-negative-but-reveals-new-secrets-of-particle-physics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="f0cb25bc-14eb-4c61-99a6-6fb0975a9585"&gt;A tsunami has hit Japan following a magnitude 7.6 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu, the country's main island, earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html#6/42.692/145.789/&amp;amp;elem=warn&amp;amp;contents=tsunami&amp;amp;lang=en" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan Meteorological Agency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has recorded tsunami waves hitting Japan's eastern coastline. The precise height of the waves is unclear at this time, but most are in the 3-foot-tall (1 meter) or less category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no reported deaths at this time, although there are some reports of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="a20d76ea-e4e8-40fb-8f54-b073644b85fb"&gt;Japan has downgraded its tsunami warning to a tsunami advisory.

CMEs have the potential to clash with Earth's magnetic field and trigger geomagnetic storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's strong geomagnetic storm forecast is associated with the eruption of a solar flare on Saturday. The resulting CME is predicted to arrive at midday tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Space Weather Prediction Center noted that the CME could also have limited, minor effects on technological infrastructure, but this can usually be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I went to see our family doctor because my arm was hurting for over a week. He diagnosed it as 'tennis elbow' and told me to take anti-inflammatories. Weeks later, I lost most of the feeling in my hand, so I was given nerve conduction tests, then imaging. It turned out I had under 50% of the normal nerve conduction, because I'd originally broken my arm and it healed badly, crushing the nerve in my elbow. I needed urgent surgery to chisel away the extra bone around the nerve. The neurosurgeon doing the operation injected the local anesthetic and waited for it to go numb. He checked my sensation and I could feel everything. Another shot. Same result. I told him to go ahead and I'd just put up with it. It was a tad painful, to say the least. If you imagine somebody literally chiselling away at your funny bone carefully for 4 hours, you'll get some idea. The nurse on my side said she'd never seen someone in that much pain before."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"At least the operation was successful, though the surgeon afterwards said he should have done it under a general anesthetic. I agree! 😩"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, Jamie, UK&lt;/p&gt;

As you can probably guess, one of those goldens is named Leia. And Leia's got a new younger sister, Daisy. Only one problem. According to a recent 10-second TikTok video, Daisy has Leia "contemplating her new life," in which she has a pesky younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video is captioned "Leia's contemplating her new life" and begins with Leia putting her front legs up on the couch, while her human parent films the interaction. Leia is trying hard to get away from Daisy, who is also standing on her hind legs and putting her front paws on the couch, mimicking her older sister and also getting closer to their human parent. The video captions what they imagine Leia is saying: "Mom, she's bothering me again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;"Mom, She's Bothering Me Again"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Daisy then moves in closer, putting her paws on her big sister, Leia. Leia immediately tries hard again to move away, and the caption on the screen reads, "Ew, too close." Daisy leans in even harder, putting her head on Leia, and the caption switches to narrating what Daisy must be thinking. "But sister, I just want to playyy," the caption says. Then the video pans back to show just a close-up of Leia's face with the caption reading, "Can we return this thing?" And that's how the video ends!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/puppy-thought-getting-versus-puppy-230500896.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: 'Puppy I Thought I Was Getting' Versus 'Puppy I Got' Video Is Cracking People Up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: 'Puppy I Thought I Was Getting' Versus 'Puppy I Got' Video Is Cracking People Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some other TikTok users chime in in the comments with their own narrations of what Leia must be thinking and trying to communicate. "Can we return it? I'll drop her off at FedEx," TikTok user @balian76 commented. "Get this thing away from me," another TikTok user adds. "Excuse me, Mother, but this is unbearable. I simply can't even," TikTok user @MissKate also comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many benefits to getting another dog as a companion for your current dog. The first benefit is just that—companionship. Especially if you're frequently out of the house for work or travel, this can give your dog some social interaction and a friend to keep them company. It's also a good way to increase your dog's activity. Younger dogs have more energy and love to play, keeping your older dog engaged and active. There are, of course, some things to consider. Mostly, it's important to be absolutely certain that both you and your current dog can handle the significant lifestyle change and all that comes with owning two dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-thinks-hes-invisible-110500419.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Golden Retriever Who Thinks He's Invisible While Stalking His Brother Has Us in Stitches;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Golden Retriever Who Thinks He's Invisible While Stalking His Brother Has Us in Stitches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-contemplating-new-life-with-puppy-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PetHelpful;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PetHelpful&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 9, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

In it, 20 adults ate one of two diets, which were identical in nutrients and differed only in their level of processing. Participants who ate ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumed about 500 kilocalories more per day and gained weight, whereas those on a minimally processed diet lost weight. The results offered strong evidence that many industrially produced foods can override satiety signals and drive overeating. And it made Hall one of the most influential figures in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02754-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51412508.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, expectations were high for his book, &lt;i&gt;Food Intelligence&lt;/i&gt;, co-written with Canadian journalist Julia Belluz. It digs deeper into the implications of the 2019 study — that the harms of processed foods can’t be reduced to their fat, sugar or salt content alone, and that the prevalent government strategy of politely asking companies to tweak their recipes by cutting salt or sugar content, say, is unlikely to address rising obesity rates. Unfortunately, the execution only partly lives up to the promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this wide-ranging primer on food science, Hall and Belluz revisit many food-related misconceptions. They debunk the idea that cutting 500 kilocalories a day reliably leads to the loss of half a kilogram a week and that “broken metabolism” explains obesity — as Hall showed in his studies on contestants who participated in &lt;i&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/i&gt;, a reality television programme built around extreme weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04163-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51793264.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Are you what you eat? How food shapes self-image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors challenge the current obsession with protein, noting that most people already consume enough through ordinary diets. They are equally dismissive of the booming supplements industry, arguing that many products lack clinical evidence or have been shown to offer no real benefit. Their scepticism extends to continuous glucose monitoring in people without diabetes, which they warn might provoke needless anxiety without providing clear advantages. The critique culminates in a forceful take down of the personalized-nutrition industry — diet plans based on genetics, which they argue have no solid scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limited legislation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracing the origins of the limited control the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts over food additives and supplements, the authors provide valuable context for why the US food environment is particularly problematic. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ensured that dietary supplements do not require premarket approval. The FDA also allows companies to introduce additive chemicals into food if these are merely ‘&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;generally recognized as safe&lt;/a&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lax regulatory framework, shaped heavily by food-industry lobbying, stands in stark contrast to the stricter regimes in much of Europe and Latin America. Some countries now warn the public about highly processed foods, yet nutrition-guideline committees in the United States and United Kingdom still decline to mention them as potentially harmful, even as the FDA has been asked to consider the issue in its upcoming review. The status quo persists despite multiple observational studies, Hall’s influential 2019 clinical trial and studies that have replicated his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51787772.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51787772.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Kevin Hall, sitting in an hospital room, speaks to someone off camera." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03977-7/d41586-025-03977-7_51787772.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Nutrition researcher Kevin Hall dispels widely held misconceptions about food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo/Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of solutions, the book argues that “personal responsibility” plays little part in nutrition — a point that, if pushed too rigidly, can feel disempowering. The authors insist that the real challenge lies in reshaping the “toxic food environment” that drives overconsumption. They call for tighter regulation and greater transparency on additives, reformulation of industrial products, and taxes on ultra-processed foods to shift diets towards whole foods, fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful message, and one that deserves wider attention, even if the book’s practical diet suggestions are underwhelming: eat less meat, eat more fruit and vegetables, and store junk food out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;A barrage of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/social-media-children-brain-rot"&gt;AI-generated brain rot&lt;/a&gt; is haunting children across numerous screens, from personal smartphones to school-issued laptops to televisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Social media is adding significantly to that cacophony, making it harder than ever for kids to concentrate. Now, new research from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University has found a significant link between screen time and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting that exposing young brains to social media could have major mental health implications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatricsopenscience/article/doi/10.1542/pedsos.2025-000922/205729/Digital-Media-Genetics-and-Risk-for-ADHD-Symptoms?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics Open Science&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers followed 8,324 children aged nine to ten years old in the US for four years. The children self-reported how much time they spent on social media, watching TV, or playing video games. Their parents also assessed their ability to pay attention and any signs of hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;There was a clear link between social media use and an attention deficit, raising the possibility that the constant sensory assault by online services like TikTok and Snapchat could be robbing kids of the ability to focus. That’s in contrast to TV or video game use, which showed no clear association with symptoms of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate,” said coauthor and Karolinska Institutet professor of cognitive neuroscience Torkel Klingberg in a &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/using-social-media-may-impair-childrens-attention" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers found that over the four years, children went from spending an average of 30 minutes a day to 2.5 hours a day on social media. Meanwhile, inattention symptoms also increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction,” Klingberg added. “This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;While it’s always hard to figure out causation in research like this, one clue is that children who were already struggling with symptoms of ADHD at the outset of the study didn’t start using social media more, suggesting that its use leads to inattentiveness, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Importantly, there was no evidence of reverse association, as average inattention symptoms did not predict increased social media use,” the paper reads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Interestingly, an increase in social media use was shown to have no effect on hyperactivity, which is also a symptom associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Although the effect size is small at the individual level, it could have significant consequences if behavior changes across population level,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As such, the number of ADHD diagnoses in the US is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/23/1252941968/adhd-diagnoses-are-rising-1-in-9-u-s-kids-have-gotten-one-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15374416.2024.2335625" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, one in nine US kids is now living with the disorder, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorizing it as an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/19960/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;expanding public health concern&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As of 2022, there were over seven million kids and adolescents in the US with a diagnosis of the condition, up from just over six million in 2016, a significant rise in only a matter of six years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to Klingberg, social media may have contributed to the trend over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Greater consumption of social media might explain part of the increase we’re seeing in ADHD diagnoses, even if ADHD is also associated with hyperactivity, which didn’t increase in our study,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers stressed that their findings didn’t establish explicit, causative links and that social media use doesn’t necessarily imply a child will develop ADHD symptoms. However, they suggest parents should discuss limiting the time children spend on social media each day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said first author and Karolinska Institutet postdoctoral researcher Samson Nivins, in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Neurology Department at Allegheny General Hospital’s Hemlock Building, Abigail Bailey’s body folded forward in her chair.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her muscles tightened as if someone had forced the air from her lungs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her nose burned, her chest hitched and she gripped the chair’s armrests to keep from collapsing.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail’s younger sister reached out and gently brushed a section of hair from her face.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt it kick in,” Abigail said. It was her physical reaction to her brain wirelessly connecting to the laptop sitting on the examination bed next to her Friday.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abigail, 24, of Hookstown in Beaver County, has lived and struggled with Tourette syndrome for more than two decades. But it wasn’t until last year — when a bladder infection led to sepsis and triggered a spike in painful motor and vocal tics — that she chose to pursue an experimental treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, she underwent a two-part deep-brain stimulation procedure. Surgeons implanted a device that delivers electrical impulses to targeted areas of the brain to treat motor disorders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘It’s time. I don’t even care what it takes. I just want my life back. I want to be happy,’” Abigail said, remembering the constant physical pain her uncontrolled tics put her through.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, eight months later, she is working full-time, living independently and preparing for her 2026 wedding.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spirits were high Friday as Abigail, joined by her sister Emily Bailey and her mother Colleen Bailey, visited the Allegheny Health Network hospital in Pittsburgh’s North Side. It was a routine visit to recalibrate the electrodes in her brain to help minimize the involuntary movements associated with Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgical Physician Assistant Amanda Webb pointed to the different parts of Abigail’s brain they were targeting on the laptop’s screen. Everyone in the room was struck by the technology and shared memories of times when Abigail’s tics were less controlled.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the nature of their visit, everyone in the hospital room laughed and told stories to the doctors and staff.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If anybody in the world should’ve had Tourette, it was Abby — because she handled it like a pro,” said Colleen.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Not curable’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail, who grew up on a farm in Hookstown, was 3 years old when her parents began to notice symptoms of Tourette syndrome.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourette’s is a neurological disorder marked by sudden, repetitive, uncontrollable movements and sounds, with symptoms typically beginning between ages 5 and 10, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition can become dangerous when tics lead to accidental self-injury.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Abigail’s case, she has broken several fingers and even her ribs during severe tic episodes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn’t realize until middle school how disruptive her tics had become. By high school, she was attending a modified schooling program.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her tics became an issue when she distracted her classmates and interrupted lessons.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were points in her life when she was younger, when she was like a fish flopping on the ground,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I started noticing the older I got the … worse it was getting,” Abigail said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She began to feel she was reverting back to childhood as she lost control of her body.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Abigail spent a week each year at a camp for people with Tourette’s and their families. There, she made friends with other kids who shared her condition and heard stories of the severe bullying many of them faced.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was eye opening,” said Emily, her sister.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abigail said she never faced bullying or cruelty from other students, many of her teachers didn’t understand her condition.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Abigail entered elementary school, Colleen met with the school board to discuss Tourette’s. She distributed handmade guidebooks explaining the condition and how to respond to it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did everything we could in order to learn about Tourette’s, because it was devastating for us to find out. But you know, your daughter has something that’s not curable, and as a mom, you want to solve everything, because that’s your job, and you can’t solve it. So you have to learn everything about it,” Colleen said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail graduated from Eastern Gateway Community College with a degree in social work, before attending Robert Morris University, in pursuit of a degree in health services administration.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘Everything pretty much revolved around my tics’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Abigail called her mother. She was extremely sick and scared.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She said, ‘Mom, I can’t get out of bed. I can’t do anything. I need your help,’ ” said Colleen, teary-eyed in the waiting room of the neurologist, before the Friday check-in appointment. “I didn’t know she had gotten that bad again. It was so bad she couldn’t do anything. It was horrible.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time she became ill, Abigail was living on her own and working as a case manager at a pharmaceutical company, helping people with chronic illnesses access care and develop treatment plans.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While hospitalized with sepsis, Abigail’s tics worsened drastically. She was placed on multiple different medications that left her feeling unlike herself.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She barely remembers that month,” Colleen said.

&lt;p class="caption" align="left"&gt;Abigail Bailey (center) at Allegheny General Hospital with Physician Assistant Amanda Webb (right) and Neuroscience Institute Chair and Surgeon Dr. Donald Whiting. (Louis B. Ruediger | Triblive )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="graybox"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="hidden-xs"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Three months later, Dr. Donald Whiting performed two surgeries — one to place the electrodes in her brain and a second to connect them to a pacemaker or “battery” inside Abigail’s chest.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, there’s circuits that connect to different structures in the brain that help modulate that activity and make sure that everything is moving smoothly … so by putting an electrode into one of those two areas and adjusting the electricity, we regulate that relay center,” said Whiting, chair of Allegheny Health Network’s Neuroscience Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail is one of only a handful of patients Whiting has performed deep-brain stimulation surgery on for Tourette’s. The Bailey family came across Whiting while researching the treatment when Abigail was still in high school, but it wasn’t until she got sick that they decided to go through with it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was so scared, as a high schooler, of somebody operating on her brain,” Colleen said. “We researched Dr. Whiting, and we knew he was the best in the field. He’d been doing it for 20 years.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, insurance companies don’t always approve it because it is still considered experimental for Tourette syndrome, Whiting said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Abigail’s insurance covered the procedure. With the machine’s help, which runs 24 hours a day, she is able to live her life again.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is more personal, but the coolest thing in this job is to really be able to make a difference in people’s lives, and particularly young people like her. This is really just amazing that she’s now going to have a life, to get married and live in a house, get a job.” Whiting said. “To me, that’s just what it’s all about.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail has been engaged to her high school sweetheart, Shane Smith, since June 2024. In August&lt;ins&gt; 2025&lt;/ins&gt;, she started a new job as a patient service representative for Heritage Valley Health System. Planning for the 2026 wedding is well underway.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything pretty much revolved around my tics,” Abigail said. “You just have to get through it. … There’s life at the end of the tunnel, we (people with Tourette’s) just have to make it there.”

&lt;/p&gt;

                Over 100 million people in the United States are estimated to have allergies each year – be they seasonal, topical, or food-related.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people in the U.S. have some allergy each year. That's about every 1 in 3 adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many, the fix is a bandaid: over-the-counter allergy medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's another treatment that works to lessen these reactions rather than just manage people's symptoms, allergy shots. The treatment has been around for over a century and is still popular today. Patients have to take the shots for a few years, and it's the closest thing science has to a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Host &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Regina G.

That’s how you lose fat, that’s how you stay full (and) lean.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of regular foods with low calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adi broke down her food list into three distinct groups. The first included foods that are “high-volume, low-calorie, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-says-these-15-high-fiber-fruits-vegetables-and-lentils-can-help-control-hunger-and-weight-loss-naturally-101764586193271.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="high-fibre"&gt;high-fibre&lt;/a&gt;” and can keep us feeling full without significantly increasing the calorie count and derailing the weight-loss journey. Such foods include the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg whites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yoghurt (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watermelon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All leafy greens (spinach, arugula, lettuce)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydrating veggies (cucumber, tomato, zucchini)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrots (smack them raw — also great for your teeth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin/squash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone broth (big volume, almost no calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pickles (super filling, almost zero calories)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air-popped popcorn (3 cups = nothing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of lean proteins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are the building blocks of our body and are absolutely essential for muscle growth. As such, lean proteins are an important part of the diet to stay healthy, even as we cut weight. Adi’s proteins of choice are listed as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;White fish (cod, tilapia)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shrimp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese (0-2%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;List of carbohydrates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While controlling the intake of carbohydrates is essential for hitting the weight loss target, the energy-rich food group is also necessary for vital functions. Foods that are rich in carbohydrates yet support fat loss as as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potatoes (one of the most filling foods on earth)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oats (huge volume when cooked with water)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rice cakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lentils + beans (absolute health powerhouse)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Adi highlights the benefits of the above foods, stating that they allow us to fill our tummy with big portions, provide nutrition without empty calories and thus make fat loss easier with fewer cravings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

'Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin [could not] partake in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joyce was forced to miss many of the joyful early days of college life, including living in the dorms, going to OSU football games, and attending classes as well as being unable to pursue her passion for dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is one of the most common in the world, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder due to the Epstein-Barr virus at the beginning of the school year and the dancer was left bed-ridden before passing on Saturday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending a significant amount of time in hospital with her mother, Terese seen on the left and Joyce's father Sean on the right, Joyce's condition 'took a sudden turn for the worse'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The young teen was an active member in her parish's youth ministry program and the Ohio State Club Dance Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most who contract the virus show no symptoms, which include fatigue, fever, inflammation of the liver and throat, rash, swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who do present symptoms, which typically appear as teens or adults, recover in around two to four weeks. Currently, there is no specific treatment for EBV and no vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Joyce, her immune system became compromised and her organs suffered 'extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid,' the GoFundMe said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But her condition only worsened and she succumbed to the illness after a months-long fight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cailin was a bright, joyful, faith-filled young woman whose presence touched so many. She will be remembered by the JOY she brought to everyone she met. She lit up every room she walked in,' the fundraiser said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The young teen was an active member in her parish's youth ministry program and the Ohio State Club Dance Team, which celebrated third place in the NCA &amp;amp; NDA Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championship in April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her teammates wrote on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR-IZUOjgHe/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;that Joyce 'embodied everything that our team represented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was kind, humble, determined, loyal and oh so funny. She danced with a fire behind her eyes and a passion that could move mountains. She made everyone around her better. Her full out love for life was contagious.

Every year, like clockwork, we see a spike in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-40-years-of-experience-shares-5-early-warning-signs-of-sudden-heart-attacks-starts-in-the-centre-101765017532465.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, around Christmas and New Year's. In fact, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/christmas" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Christmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; Eve is the highest risk day of the year. Well, why does this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behaviour and holiday habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to Dr London, drastic changes in eating and drinking habits during the holidays can put extra strain on the heart, increasing the risk of heart attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “First is our behaviour. We drink too much, we eat too much, and we tend to move less around the holidays.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The holiday season also brings a surge of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/stress" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="stress"&gt;stress &lt;/a&gt;- from financial pressures to social obligations and packed schedules - all of which can quietly elevate the risk of heart attacks. Dr London highlights, “Next is stress - emotional stress, financial stress, the increased pace of the holidays, increased obligations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cold weather&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The heart surgeon explains that cold weather causes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-explains-why-your-heart-attack-risk-doubles-at-night-this-is-when-blood-vessels-tighten-blood-pressure-101757039051096.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood vessels"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; to constrict, reducing blood flow, thereby raising the risk of heart attacks. He explains, “Cold weather causes vasoconstriction which increases the risk of plaque rupture and potential heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Amid the celebrations and holiday cheer, people often ignore their body’s warning signs, brushing off symptoms and delaying medical attention - and sometimes that can lead to serious complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr London puts it as, “And finally, is delay. I don't feel good but I'll wait till after holiday dinner to get checked out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to prevent holiday heart attacks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr London outlines four precautionary measures you can adopt to prevent unnecessary complications during the holidays.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Movement is medicine: Maintain or increase your activity level. Dr London recommends getting out and exercising every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t skip your meds: Set an alarm on your phone as a reminder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritise sleep and mindfulness: Taking care of yourself during this stressful time is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t ignore symptoms: If you feel like something is off, don’t ignore it.

							&lt;p&gt;Strength doesn’t always announce itself loudly. Sometimes it shows up in the small, thoughtful ways people speak to us when we need it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I think about people with genuinely strong personalities, I’m reminded of how gentle they often are in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use language that grounds people instead of shaking them, and psychology consistently shows that supportive communication is one of the biggest markers of emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’ve noticed over the years, both in my own relationships and while diving into the research around behavior and communication, is that strong personalities tend to gravitate toward certain phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t catchphrases or motivational slogans. They’re simple sentences that make others feel understood, valued, and capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I want to share seven of those phrases with you. They’re small, but trust me, they carry weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) “I see why you’d feel that way.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something incredibly calming about feeling understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase offers instant validation without taking sides, which is one of the most psychologically grounding things you can do for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities know that people aren’t usually asking to be fixed. They’re asking to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence does exactly that because it shows that you listened long enough to recognize the emotional logic behind what someone is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a version of this habit while traveling through Japan in my twenties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations there emphasized harmony and understanding, and people took their time acknowledging each other’s feelings before offering any kind of opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, whenever I use this phrase, I can almost feel that same &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/dna-7-daily-habits-of-people-who-stay-calm-no-matter-what-life-throws-at-them/"&gt;sense of calm&lt;/a&gt; passing through the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation isn’t agreement. It’s respect. Strong personalities understand that difference, and that’s why they use this phrase so naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) “Tell me more.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those phrases that immediately shifts the entire direction of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It tells the other person that you’re not planning your rebuttal, you’re not jumping to conclusions, and you’re not assuming you already know where the story is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone says, “Tell me more,” they’re signaling curiosity instead of judgment. Curiosity lowers walls. Judgment builds them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with strong personalities choose curiosity because they aren’t threatened by different perspectives, and they aren’t in a rush to control the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this phrase often when I’m trying to understand someone’s thought process, especially when I’m interviewing people or digging into a psychological concept I’m writing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper you go into someone’s experience, the more clarity you get about what they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/nat-people-who-have-a-rare-combination-of-high-intelligence-and-deep-intuition-usually-display-these-8-behaviors/"&gt;intuitively make space&lt;/a&gt; for that clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a simple phrase that makes people feel safe opening up. And in my experience, it’s one of the most generous ones you can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) “You’re not alone in this.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren’t overwhelmed because they don’t have solutions. They’re overwhelmed because they think they’re carrying something alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/social-isolation-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calls&lt;/a&gt; this “perceived social isolation,” and it’s powerful enough to make even ordinary challenges feel impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities tend to be the first to interrupt that belief. They know how heavy life can feel when you convince yourself you’re on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they say the words we don’t realize we’re desperate to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a close friend of mine was going through a brutal breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have anything insightful or wise to say at that moment, but I remember telling him, “You’re not alone in this. I’m here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t offering a solution. I was &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-8-phrases-emotionally-intelligent-people-use-when-they-notice-someone-is-quietly-struggling/"&gt;offering presence&lt;/a&gt;. And sometimes, presence is the very thing that lifts someone back onto their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase uplifts because it reminds us that carrying something together changes the weight of it. Strong people know that, and they offer their companionship freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) “You’ve handled tough things before.”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often forget their own resilience. When stress hits, memory gets short, and we act like every challenge is the first one we’ve ever faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase gently reconnects someone to their own strength by pointing them back to their previous victories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In psychology, this ties into a concept called &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-self-efficacy-2795954" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially your belief in your ability to handle life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities speak to that belief directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They remind people of what they’ve already survived, knowing it will give them confidence to face what’s in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this one from a mentor early in my writing career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’d panic about a deadline, he’d say, “This isn’t your first climb.” For whatever reason, those words always centered me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-i-held-onto-resentment-for-years-then-i-learned-these-8-steps-to-truly-let-go/"&gt;shifted my focus from fear&lt;/a&gt; to capability, and I’ve used a version of that phrase in countless conversations since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with strong personalities know that sometimes the most uplifting thing you can do is help someone remember who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this phrase does exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) “It’s okay to take your time.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If modern life had a soundtrack, it would be a constant ticking clock. We’re always rushing, always &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-5-things-i-stopped-doing-that-made-me-happier-in-15-days-than-id-been-in-years/"&gt;comparing our timelines&lt;/a&gt;, always feeling like we’re behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities break that pattern for other people by reminding them that there’s no universal schedule for growth or healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase permits people to slow down without feeling guilty. It creates space where pressure used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is often the one thing someone needs to breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I’m out shooting photos, I catch myself rushing more than I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But funny enough, the best images I’ve ever taken came from slowing down and letting the moment settle. Life works the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong people understand that not everything needs to be solved immediately, and not every chapter needs to be hurried through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying, “It’s okay to take your time,” they offer people a kind of emotional permission many of us rarely give ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hearing it can feel like someone loosening a knot in your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) “What do you need right now?”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of assuming the answer or diving into advice mode, people with strong personalities go straight to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask the person what they actually want or need in that moment. It seems obvious, but most of us forget to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/k-9-phrases-boomers-use-that-younger-generations-secretly-find-comforting/"&gt;encourages clarity&lt;/a&gt;, autonomy, and emotional honesty. It hands the power back to the person who might be feeling powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And psychologically, it transforms the dynamic from “I know what’s best” to “You know what’s best, and I’m here to support that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to a reader recently who said this question changed the way she leaned on her friends during &lt;a href="https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;burnout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks, she didn’t know how to articulate what she needed until someone asked her directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when he did, the answer came easily. She needed rest. She needed quiet. She needed permission to step back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities help people uncover that truth instead of assuming it. This phrase is an invitation to self-awareness, and that alone can be deeply uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) “I believe in you.”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phrase is simple, but it’s a psychological powerhouse. Humans tend to rise to the level of the expectations the people around them hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone with a strong personality says they believe in you, something inside you stands a little taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tied to the &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/pygmalion-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pygmalion effect&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that positive expectations from others can actually improve someone’s performance and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t magic. It’s social psychology. And it works more often than you’d expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the first time an editor trusted me with a big feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I was ready, but he did, and I leaned into his belief until it became my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities use this phrase when it matters, not as empty flattery but as a &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/c-lc-my-evenings-felt-aimless-and-restless-but-these-7-rituals-gave-me-structure-and-calm/"&gt;genuine reflection&lt;/a&gt; of what they see in someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often forget their strengths. A phrase like this can return them instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong personalities aren’t defined by volume, intensity, or force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re defined by the way they communicate calm, confidence, and compassion to the people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seven phrases uplift because they validate, reassure, and empower. They make people feel capable. They make people feel accompanied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they make people feel human in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can develop this type of strength. It starts with being intentional about the words we choose and the presence we bring into every conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

"Because we don't know where this infection originated, it's important that everyone in the Bingham school community be aware of symptoms and the possibility they were exposed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department warned that symptoms can usually appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include high fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash. So they advise anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms to contact their health care provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best form of protection against measles is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. It added that vaccinated people who do get measles tend to have milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications," the department noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

In hot climates, that combination can tip someone toward headaches, dizziness, darker urine, and higher heart rate-and creatine becomes an easy scapegoat instead of the overall hydration strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:48:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>音乐如何像大脑的食物- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/09/music-therapy-app-spiritune-brain-mental-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:37:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPdllTbjFGbVZLYzdrc0dzSjdVLVNMQTBBbWJWaXI3U29XaDlTUmNDZHJycDRXUmp5OGsyaTNPOF8tc29oN3Utem5RT2h0WjlacEFLX0JjUTZYU0tad1NqSWg4VFNRcFJZZEdoeDkzNjYzdlhINGh1d1VVMzZsVFRybFY2MnprUHc</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么麻疹疫情刚刚发生了危险的新转变- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/09/measles-outbreak-symptoms-elimination-status-outbreak</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 02:01:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOaWQyUlJLU09QemdlS0hqSmI2MWtsUUJpYmxpcHZJYTNCdFByczNaak5HMURWMnlqUWQyMFVlZnhfalpZcF80UzdqQjFLN055RkhKYXFtaHR2ankybElMajRpYzNXa3dfTXdzX1BuZFhrNTMzdzNZeUo2QWR0WVJCZGt0ZlhRenAzLWE3dDE3TQ</guid></item><item><title>研究声称，流行饮食可能会加速衰老- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/study-claims-that-popular-keto-diet-may-accelerate-aging/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strict form of the keto diet has been linked to faster cellular aging in males, while females on the same plan did not show the same damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference appears to come down to sex hormones and how they shape the way cells handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new work, male animals on a very high fat, very low carbohydrate diet built up damaged, nondividing cells in the heart and kidneys over just a few weeks, while females were largely spared the same burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments were run by a team at UT Health San Antonio, raising sharp questions about whether similar patterns could emerge in men who stay on keto diets for long stretches of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-diet-and-aging"&gt;Keto diet and aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by David Gius, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology at &lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Health San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;. His research focuses on how metabolism, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-keep-an-hourly-rhythm-shaping-mood-and-energy/"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt;, and stress inside cells shape aging and disease across different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the ketogenic diet, a very low carbohydrate, high fat way of eating, is designed to push the body away from sugar and toward fat as its main energy source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The keto diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high fat way of eating that shifts the body’s primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat,” explained Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When carb intake stays low enough, the liver produces ketones, small fuel molecules made from fat that can power the brain and other organs when glucose is scarce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully planned ketogenic programs are a long standing therapy for drug resistant epilepsy, and a pediatric hospital keto &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27373-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;clinic&lt;/a&gt; has reported large seizure reductions in many children without major growth problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-aging-and-keto-diets"&gt;Studying aging and keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one mouse &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725007971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, male animals fed a keto diet for several weeks showed a spike in markers of cellular aging called senescence, a state where stressed cells stop dividing but stay alive and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These senescent cells piled up in the heart and kidney, along with higher levels of inflammatory molecules in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female mice on the same diet did not show the same surge in senescent cells or inflammatory signals over that time window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their heart and kidney tissue stayed closer to normal, even though their blood ketone levels confirmed they were in ketosis just like the males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male mice also showed strong signs of oxidative stress, an overload of reactive oxygen containing molecules that chip away at fats, proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-autism-to-neanderthal-dna-genetic-variants-found-in-modern-humans/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage markers such as oxidized lipids and modified proteins climbed in male organs on keto, while female tissues again remained largely unchanged under the same feeding plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older female mice with naturally lower estrogen levels began to look more like the males when they were placed on a ketogenic diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They developed more senescent cells and oxidative damage, linking the protection seen in younger females to hormone status rather than sex alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-oxidative-stress-and-aging-cells"&gt;Hormones, oxidative stress, and aging cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test that idea directly, the team treated some male mice with estrogen, a major female sex hormone that also influences metabolism and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those males no longer showed the keto driven rise in senescent cells or oxidative damage, suggesting that estrogen was actively buffering their tissues against stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This protective role fits with broader research showing that estrogen can tune up the cell’s own defense systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, estrogen replacement &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to switch on antioxidant and longevity related genes and to lower several measures of oxidative stress, supporting the idea that hormone status changes how tissues weather metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tried a different route, giving male mice classic antioxidants, compounds that neutralize reactive oxygen molecules before they harm cell structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents such as N-acetylcysteine, alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, and a drug that mimics the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD, all cut back the buildup of senescent cells and oxidative damage in keto fed males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those antioxidant treatments also brought inflammatory blood markers down toward normal in the male mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the hormone and antioxidant experiments suggest that the diet itself creates extra oxidative pressure, but hormones and chemical defenses can either blunt or amplify the impact on aging cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keto-in-real-people-risks-and-uses"&gt;Keto in real people, risks and uses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal work like this does not translate directly to humans, which the researchers themselves stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” said Jason Ng, MD, BA, who teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://dom.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, human data already show that keto style patterns are not neutral for the heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a randomized feeding &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33801247/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, healthy young women following a ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat diet developed very high LDL cholesterol levels compared with when they ate a more conventional non keto diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A broad cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280624000410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; concludes that low carbohydrate patterns can bring quick drops in weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar, yet they do not outperform other eating styles for long term cardiovascular outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That review also flags safety questions, including nutrient gaps, kidney strain, and possible effects on arterial plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate work in male mice found that long periods of keto feeding led to fat buildup in the liver and worse glucose control, changes that eased after switching back to standard chow in one &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1290540/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mixed findings underline that keto is a strong &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-extracts-may-help-treat-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic &lt;/a&gt;tool, not a harmless shortcut, and responses can vary across bodies and over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-lessons-from-keto-diets"&gt;Aging lessons from keto diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mouse work suggests that deep carb restriction might speed the accumulation of senescent cells in some tissues, at least in male animals with typical hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of cellular aging is linked in other research to stiffer hearts, weaker kidneys, and chronic low grade inflammation as organisms grow older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, ketogenic therapy remains a vital option for some people with severe epilepsy when other drugs fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” said Routhenstein, who emphasized the need for professional guidance when such a restrictive diet is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people drawn to keto mainly for weight loss or short term glucose control, the picture is more unsettled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings add sex and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; status to a growing list of factors that likely shape who does well, who runs into trouble, and how long such a diet should reasonably continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this research, one message stands out clearly: very low carbohydrate, very high fat diets act as powerful metabolic stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering them as a lifestyle choice, rather than a time limited medical therapy, needs careful medical supervision, regular lab checks, and an honest look at whether less extreme changes could meet their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00797-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2211124725007971%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region has seen two confirmed human cases of &lt;a href="https://www.pima.gov/2720/Newsroom?contentId=0e3f1793-94e6-4ffe-bc70-7f7527646ee7" target="_blank"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; in 2025&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diseases like West Nile virus are known as "&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;vector-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt;," a class of diseases that infect humans through the bites of arthropods like fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-88403d5a29392b7611b66112dea3a6fe theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-88403d5a29392b7611b66112dea3a6fe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-69b34f23595ebfc51d398c4fbbe33302 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-69b34f23595ebfc51d398c4fbbe33302"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e37eb46fcd4c5bc65ba5b2cb3d446bc8 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-e37eb46fcd4c5bc65ba5b2cb3d446bc8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-30e55e7a457a6cdd5a0231f0377c46b6 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-30e55e7a457a6cdd5a0231f0377c46b6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-3d876f2e81d079827d6ae36eb06c32d6 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-3d876f2e81d079827d6ae36eb06c32d6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes can not only infect humans, but they can also pick up the disease of an already infected human with their bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-2a6a67f22e63f64cf05d197c641550a3 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-2a6a67f22e63f64cf05d197c641550a3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-the-relationship-between-a-warmer-planet-and-vector-borne-illnesses-concerning"&gt;Why is the relationship between a warmer planet and vector-borne illnesses concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the American Southwest, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues/" target="_blank"&gt;rising temperatures&lt;/a&gt; mean that summer heat waves are more extreme than ever, which speeds up the mosquito lifecycle, expands their reach and longevity, and increases their numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-4261581203" data-theco-trackid="446882" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="theco-3120c6e45430773e1d343f19b2eaec58 theco-embedded-video" id="theco-3120c6e45430773e1d343f19b2eaec58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more intense monsoon seasons are ideal for mosquito breeding, as they need to lay their eggs in water. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/quinx-mosquito-spread-west-nile-virus/" target="_blank"&gt;The bug's ability to adapt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/mosquitoes-adapting-rising-temperatures/" target="_blank"&gt;changing climate conditions&lt;/a&gt; also concerns scientists, as it makes prevention methods a more temporary solution, with the need to update practices over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-62417e8a7070ca2edd1507faec803684 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-62417e8a7070ca2edd1507faec803684"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The new places that become better for mosquitoes outweigh the places that are currently experiencing and might experience less due to high temperatures," explained Heidi Brown, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/psr/yearinreview2021" target="_blank"&gt;In 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Pima County in Arizona saw over 100 cases of West Nile virus during a year littered with particularly hot weather and a violent monsoon season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As global temperatures rise and extreme weather becomes stronger, longer, and more frequent &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/steroids-extreme-weather-climate-change-storms/" target="_blank"&gt;as a result&lt;/a&gt;, the region will likely see more years of elevated case counts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It's one of the things that's fascinating to me as a scientist," Brown said. "These diseases shouldn't exist, right? It just seems completely improbable, and yet it's not. It's a very big problem globally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-d7a8ea6b19b30b88ab32fc0b487a8408 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-d7a8ea6b19b30b88ab32fc0b487a8408"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-to-mitigate-disease-transmission-by-mosquitoes"&gt;What's being done to mitigate disease transmission by mosquitoes?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Southern Arizona, one of the methods to manage vector-borne diseases is a more indirect approach that addresses other concerns in the area. Municipalities are experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/red-oak-rain-garden-university-illinois/" target="_blank"&gt;green stormwater infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; to recycle much-needed water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The method not only benefits the water supply but also helps reduce the amount of standing water that makes for ideal mosquito breeding conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The reason that we care about green stormwater infrastructure is because adding nature back into the urban environment provides all of these benefits in the urban environment that we really need, like cooling, shade, air quality improvement," said Blue Baldwin, program manager for the City of Tucson's climate action initiative Storm to Shade, per AZPM.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend the birth dose only for the infants of women who test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection status is unknown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The panel voted that women whose blood tests show they aren’t infected with hepatitis B should discuss the issue with their doctors. The acting CDC director, Jim O’Neill, MA, has not yet announced whether the agency will adopt the recommendations as official policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hospitals, regional health alliances rejecting ACIP recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago will continue to recommend hepatitis B vaccines to newborns within 24 hours of delivery – when immunization will protect the largest proportion of infants – as recommended by the Chicago and Illinois health departments, said Larry K. Kociolek, MD, MSCI, vice president of system preparedness, prevention, and response and a pediatric infectious diseases attending physician.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The pediatric vaccine schedule currently adopted in the US is based on decades of research, extensive real-world experience, and vetting by well-trained and unbiased medical and public health experts,” Kociolek told CIDRAP News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recommendations from the ACIP “were made without any new research suggesting that the current vaccine schedule is flawed in terms of its safety or effectiveness,” Kociolek said. “We will continue to endorse the pediatric vaccine schedule currently in place.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ACIP’s members were handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist. Many of the new members parrot Kennedy’s false claims that vaccines aren’t adequately tested for safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ACIP’s decision to vaccinate only babies deemed to be at “high risk” for hepatitis B flies in the face of evidence, said Ravi Jhaveri, MD, head of infectious diseases at Lurie Children’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new recommendation “assumes that we can accurately predict who has infection and who will be exposed in the future; we cannot,” said Jhaveri, who noted that previous recommendations to target hepatitis B vaccines toward babies of infected moms failed to lower infection rates. “This is the lesson we learned prior to starting birth dose. The fact that this committee ignores our prior experience proves their agenda has nothing to do with the evidence.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other clinicians are taking a similar approach. The hepatitis B vaccine is “safe, exceptionally effective, and one of the great success stories in modern public health,” said Stephen Patrick, MD, MPH, MS, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital of Atlanta, who said he will not change how he practices because of the ACIP vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For the first time in my career, I am deeply concerned that I cannot fully rely on the CDC’s recommendations,” Patrick said. “My duty is to my patients, and I will continue to lean on my training and the best available evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the CDC recommended a universal birth dose, about 30,000 children were infected every year, he said. About 90% of infants infected at birth develop chronic hepatitis B. About 25% of children with chronic infections die prematurely from liver cancer or cirrhosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In defiance of Kennedy and the agency he is remaking in his image, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/12/west-coast-health-experts-reject-rfk-jr-panel-say-hepatitis-b-vaccines-at-birth-should-continue.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-01-01_statement_northeast_public_health_collaborative.htm%23:~:text=ALBANY%2C%20N.Y.%20(December%201%2C%202025)%20%E2%80%93%20%22The,that%20all%20newborns%20receive%20a%20hepatitis%20B"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Northeast Public Health Collaborative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govsforhealth.org/news/govs-acip-hepb-2/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Governors Public Health Alliance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also rejected the ACIP’s proposal. The regional health care alliances were formed in recent months, largely in states led by Democratic governors, to provide an alternative to the CDC, which has lost the confidence of doctors across the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaming up with parents to protect children&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Manisha Juthani, MD, an infectious disease physician and commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said her state has no plans to change its vaccination policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We do not anticipate changing our policy,” Juthani said today at a press conference of public health leaders. “If anything, we are more concerned about how to communicate and clarify the noise from the facts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Juthani said all vaccines are given only after informed consent from parents or guardian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No vaccine is put into the into a child without the consent of the parent,” Juthani said. “We are going to still encourage providers to have that conversation at birth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Maryland Department of Health has issued a standing order “to ensure hepatitis B vaccine accessibility to all children and infants in the state,” said Michelle Taylor, MD, DrPH, MPS, commissioner of the Baltimore City Health Department and incoming chair of the Big Cities Health Coalition, at the press conference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the first time in my career, I am deeply concerned that I cannot fully rely on the CDC’s recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many parents will be confused by ACIP’s recommendation, and pediatricians should be willing to listen to them and provide thoughtful answers, said Lisa Costello, MD, MPH, chair of the AAP’s committee on state government affairs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People “fiercely love their children, and they want to do what's in their best interest,” Costello, a pediatrician and associate professor of general pediatrics at the West Virginia University School of Medicine, said at the press conference. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As pediatricians, we're on that team with them,” she added. The vaccine discussion is “one that we need to keep having and make sure that we're meeting people where they're at.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance coverage of vaccines to continue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Private insurance plans will continue to cover the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccines as well, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bcbs.com/about-us/association-news/blue-cross-blue-shield-statement-vaccines"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BlueCross BlueShield Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage"&gt;&lt;span&gt;AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an industry group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AHIP members will cover all vaccines recommended by ACIP as September 1, including updated flu shots and COVID-19 vaccines, with no cost sharing through the end of 2026. BlueCross BlueShield companies will cover all vaccines approved as of January 1, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In August, Kennedy warned health providers not to deviate from the CDC’s vaccine recommendations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AAP should also be candid with doctors and hospitals that recommendations that diverge from the CDC’s official list are not shielded from liability under the 1986 Vaccine Injury Act,” Kennedy posted on X, the social media platform.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That statement is misleading, said Dorit Reiss, PhD, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors could defend themselves from malpractice claims by citing the AAP vaccine schedule as a standard of care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If there are multiple standards in the profession, it is not malpractice as long as you followed one of the accepted approaches,” Reiss said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hepatitis B vaccines are still included in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a program established by Congress nearly 40 years ago, said Richard H. Hughes IV, JD, MPH, who teaches vaccine law at George Washington University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That means that families who believe that their child was injured by a vaccine are still required to first file a complaint with the vaccine court. If the vaccine court rejects their claim, they may sue in civil court.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AAP guidelines form a viable standard of care and there are liability shields under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,” Hughes said. “Therefore, providers should have protections.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If Kennedy wants to remove hepatitis B vaccines from the VICP, the law requires that he go through a lengthy rule-making process, in which proposed changes are published and the public is given time to comment, Reiss said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jhaveri said he is trying to take an optimistic view.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think most people see vaccines as a positive thing, which is why they consistently get their children vaccinated,” Jhaveri said. “I think this will continue because they can see the benefits of vaccines for themselves.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						A southern Iowa school district has canceled classes Tuesday, Dec. 9 and Wednesday, Dec. 10 due to illness. An official with the Moulton-Udell School District, in Appanoose County, told KCCI about 30% of students and staff are out — many with influenza A. "We will use this time to fully sanitize our facilities and provide a needed health reset for our students, staff, and families," the school posted on its Facebook page. Athletic events and other activities are also canceled.Last month, following the state's first flu-related death of the season, KCCI spoke to several medical professionals about how to stay healthy this winter. State Medical Director Dr. Robert Kruse issued a statement urging Iowans to talk with their doctors about getting the flu shot and reminding anyone who is ill — or whose children are ill — to stay home. The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services also recommends that Iowans:Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.» Subscribe to KCCI's YouTube page» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play

&lt;p&gt;The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services also recommends that Iowans:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cream-inline-rec" class="cream-inline hidden"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;» &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KCCI" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Subscribe to KCCI's YouTube page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;» Download the free KCCI app to get updates on the go: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=109350X1567025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fkcci-8-news-des-moines%2Fid505215818&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kcci.com%2Farticle%2Fiowa-school-district-cancels-classes-tuesday-wednesday-due-to-widespread-illness-moulton-udell%2F69665507&amp;amp;xcust=undefined" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hearst.android.kcci&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Play&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="screen-reader-only"&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;U.S. health officials have issued travel advisories for Americans planning trips to certain tropical countries amid outbreaks of an untreatable mosquito-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced Friday that it has issued Level 2 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/cuba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;travel advisories for Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Guangdong Province in southern China, advising Americans to "practice enhanced precautions" when visiting these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say there are currently no treatments for chikungunya, but the disease is vaccine-preventable, and vaccination is recommended for travelers to affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of the virus include fever and joint pain, though patients may also experience headache, muscle pain, joint swelling or a rash, according to health officials. Symptoms typically appear three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and most people recover within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/cdc-reports-19th-cruise-ship-norovirus-outbreak-year-affecting-passengers-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC REPORTS 19TH CRUISE SHIP NOROVIRUS OUTBREAK THIS YEAR, AFFECTING PASSENGERS AND CREW&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt;

established to help support the family — particularly her mother, Terese, who had to take time off work to stay with her daughter in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fundraiser explained, Joyce had been diagnosed with a rare blood disorder, which “left her immune system compromised, her organs with extreme inflammation resulting in her body retaining a ton of fluid.” The once active teen — she was a member of the Ohio State Club Dance Team and active in her parish’s youth ministry program — was left bedridden due to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Cailin Joyce, 19, died from a rare disorder caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin has been contained to 4 tiny walls in a hospital room for many weeks now as doctors try to understand more about her rare condition. This has come with daily blood draws, blood transfusions, bone marrow tests and so many more treatments that I can’t even remember the names of,” the GoFundMe explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cailin is unable to do simple tasks that many healthy individuals take for granted. Things such as hugging people, going outside, taking a hot shower and being around people are all tasks Cailin cannot partake in. She fatigues quickly making it hard for her to walk short distances. Things like living in the dorms, dining in dining halls, going to OSU football games, going to in person classes, going to Mass [at] the Newman Center and even dancing are all things she hasn’t been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus often won’t cause symptoms, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23469-epstein-barr-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine prevent more than 97% of measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated individuals who do get measles tend to experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone associated with Bingham High School who develops symptoms should call their healthcare provider or clinic before arriving so the facility can provide instructions about how to seek care without exposing other people to the virus," the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jordan School District sent the following statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Jordan School District is working closely with the Salt Lake County Health Department to address a confirmed measles case associated with Bingham High School’s Daycare Program.

Apart from the experimental medicine, the only option left was to make their death more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I really did think that I was going to die and I wouldn't be able to grow up and do all the things that every child deserves to be able to do," says 16-year-old Alyssa Tapley from Leicester. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She was the first person in the world to have the treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital and is now enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Alyssa is now enjoying life&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The revolutionary treatment three years ago involved wiping out her old immune system and growing a new one.

Alyssa is doing her A-levels, the Duke of Edinburgh Award, eyeing up driving lessons and planning her future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'm looking into doing an apprenticeship in biomedical science, and hopefully one day I'll go into blood cancer research as well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The team at University College London (UCL) and Great Ormond Street Hospital used a technology called base editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Bases are the language of life. The four types of base - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) - are the building blocks of our genetic code. Just as letters in the alphabet spell out words that carry meaning, the billions of bases in our DNA spell out the instruction manual for our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Base editing allows scientists to zoom to a precise part of the genetic code and then alter the molecular structure of just one base, converting it from one type to another and rewriting the instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Researchers wanted to harness the natural power of healthy T-cells to seek out and destroy threats and turn that against the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is a tricky feat. They had to engineer the good T-cells to hunt the bad ones without the treatment annihilating itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They started with healthy T-cells from a donor and set about modifying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The first base edit disabled the T-cells' targeting mechanism so they could not attack the patient's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The second removed a chemical marking, called CD7, which is on all T-cells. Removing it is essential for preventing the therapy from self-destructing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The third edit was an "invisibility cloak" that prevented the cells being killed by a chemotherapy drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The final stage of genetic modification instructed the T-cells to go hunting for anything with the CD7 marking on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now the modified T-cells would destroy every other T-cell they found whether they were cancerous or healthy, but they would not attack each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The therapy is infused into patients and if their cancer cannot be detected after four weeks, then patients have a bone marrow transplant to regrow their immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A few years ago, this would have been science fiction," says Prof Waseem Qasim from UCL and Great Ormond Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to basically dismantle the entire immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's a deep, intensive treatment, it's very demanding on the patients, but when it works, it's worked very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reports the results of the first 11 patients treated across Great Ormond Street and King's College Hospital.

One study of more than 60,000 participants found that inconsistent bed and wake times predicted early death more strongly than the number of hours slept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="b8ri1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="djegf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="djegf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="djegf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep most nights. Try to go to bed and wake up at similar times, even on weekends. Get daylight exposure in the morning and cut back on screens before bed. Both help reset the body’s clock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="7leaq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7leaq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7leaq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Bottom line: Sleep is not “wasting time.” It is one of the best investments you can make in a longer, healthier life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="13mrh-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="13mrh-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13mrh-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For many people, exercise is all or nothing. Either a gym membership and 10,000 steps a day, or nothing. But the data tell a very different story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="eaolf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eaolf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eaolf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Meta analyses and large scale studies show that even meeting the modest guideline of about 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, significantly lowers mortality risk, and the benefit holds at almost any age. Recent studies also broke another major myth. You do not need 10,000 steps a day. Among older women, even 4,000 steps a day, one or two times a week, were linked to a 25% to 40% drop in risk of death from any cause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="5ppvt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5ppvt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5ppvt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;And it is not only about volume. Another study found that short bursts of activity, even one minute of intense effort, like taking stairs or running for the bus, repeated a few times a day, were tied to a meaningful reduction in mortality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="4thq7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4thq7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4thq7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Bottom line: You do not need a marathon. You just need to move. Every day, even in small ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="bv8jg-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="lfr7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="lfr7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="lfr7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Media coverage of nutrition almost always jumps from trend to trend, keto, intermittent fasting, the next miracle diet. In research, the picture is much steadier. A Mediterranean eating pattern rich in vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish and olive oil, and low in ultra processed foods, is consistently linked to lower overall mortality and lower death rates from heart disease, cancer and degenerative illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="47ho3" data-offset-key="cle3t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cle3t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cle3t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Large studies tracking women for up to 25 years found that those who adhered more closely to a Mediterranean pattern had a lower risk of death from any cause.

already agree that beta-blockers are crucial when the heart’s pumping strength is clearly reduced, measured as a “low left ventricular ejection fraction.” This refers to the share of blood pumped out with each beat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people whose pumping strength looks normal, with no heart failure or rhythm problems, several expert groups have questioned whether staying on the drug for years really adds much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-new-trial-tested"&gt;What the new trial tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the BETAMI and DANBLOCK &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt;, researchers enrolled adults who had recently survived a myocardial infarction in hospitals across Norway and Denmark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every participant had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; of at least 40 percent and no signs of heart failure, which meant their hearts were still pumping reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the first couple of weeks after the heart attack, about half the patients were randomly assigned to long term beta-blocker treatment and the rest to no beta-blocker at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events like death, new heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, unplanned procedures to reopen arteries, and dangerous rhythms were tracked for a median of 3.5 years and compared using a hazard ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients taking a beta-blocker had fewer events of death or serious cardiovascular complications than those who did not, with a hazard ratio of 0.85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 95 percent confidence interval, from 0.75 to 0.98, indicates that this difference is unlikely to be due to chance alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-team-found"&gt;What the team found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers broke the outcome into pieces, they saw that new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-is-worse-for-the-heart-than-cocaine/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attacks occurred in 5.0 percent of patients on beta-blockers, compared with 6.7 percent in those not taking them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of stroke, heart failure, unplanned coronary procedures, and serious rhythm disturbances stayed very low and quite similar between the two groups, and deaths from any cause were rare in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the trial did not reveal any major safety problems with long term use in this selected group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious side effects strong enough to make patients stop the medicine were uncommon, which provides some reassurance for people already taking these drugs after a recent heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-beta-blockers-matter"&gt;Why beta-blockers matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients who leave the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hospital-food-puts-patients-at-risk-and-the-planet/"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; with a heart that still pumps fairly well, doctors have struggled with whether a beta-blocker really improves survival or simply adds extra pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial suggests that, at least for people with preserved or mildly reduced pumping function and no arrhythmia, an abnormal or irregular heart rhythm, the treatment can lower the chance of another major event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit is modest rather than dramatic, so the decision to continue or start a beta-blocker still needs to balance possible tiredness, low blood pressure, or cold hands against the reduction in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many younger or higher risk patients, especially those with mildly weakened heart pumping, that tradeoff may still come out in favor of staying on the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-still-remain"&gt;Questions still remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At almost the same time, another large &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2512686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a study that combines data from several clinical trials, reported that beta-blockers did not improve survival or prevent new heart attacks in patients whose ejection fraction was at least 50 percent after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work pooled individual patient data from five randomized studies and painted a more skeptical picture for people whose hearts appear completely normal on pumping tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01592-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; focused only on people with mildly reduced ejection fraction between 40 and 49 percent found clear benefit from beta-blockers in preventing repeat heart attacks and heart failure episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern, where patients with slightly weakened hearts gain the most, is supported by pooled data from European and Japanese trials that were reanalyzed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these mixed results explain why many guideline committees have not rushed to make sweeping changes for patients with normal heart function after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will probably focus on teasing apart which subgroups, defined by age, sex, heart pumping strength, and other illnesses, truly gain enough from beta-blockers to justify long term treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone recovering from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack, the practical message is simple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication decisions should never be changed on their own, and the best next step is a detailed conversation with a treating cardiologist who can weigh personal risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2505985?query=featured_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By DAMIEN FISHER, InDepthNH.org&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire parents will still be able to get their newborns life-saving vaccines against hepatitis B despite U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s efforts to curb the practice, according to a memo the New Hampshire Health Alert sent to medical providers Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Alert, part of the NH Department of Health and Human Services, wasn’t sent to the general public reiterating the medical value of the hepatitis B vaccine as the state continues to recommend the shots despite federal changes.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Last week, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to stop recommending the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who made millions for his anti-vaccine advocacy, replaced the public health officials on the ACIP this summer with people who share his discredited theories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the Alert to medical providers Friday, Maddie Miller, Public Health Public Information Officer, responded Monday: “Please see the statement below, attributed to State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is aware of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ (ACIP) vote to no longer universally recommend the hepatitis B vaccine for all infants and children. DHHS and leading expert medical organizations, such as the &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/prevention-wellness/immunizations-vaccines/immunization-schedules/birth-through-age-18-immunization-schedule.html?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, continue to recommend hepatitis B vaccination for all children, with the first dose given within 24 hours after birth, as the best way to protect kids against hepatitis B and the lifelong health problems it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The Department will continue to monitor the impacts of the ACIP decision to ensure New Hampshire families that want the hepatitis B vaccine have access to it. DHHS encourages anyone with questions about any vaccine to speak to a trusted healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked why the public wasn’t told, she didn’t immediately respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is an incurable disease that can result in liver cancer, cirrhosis, and early death. About half the people with hepatitis B do not know they have it, and the disease is passed on by coming into contact with fluids like blood, saliva. The virus can live on a surface for up to a week, and unvaccinated children who come into contact with that surface can then be infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children are susceptible to contracting the disease playing sports, in daycare settings, or from a parent who has an undiagnosed case. About 25 percent of children who contract the disease will die from it. Before infant vaccinations became common 30 years ago, there were 18,000 children infected every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Half of the childhood cases are the result of mother-to-child transmission, but that transmission can be stopped by giving the vaccine to newborns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a cut, that blood could potentially get on the infant,” Anita Patel, a  pediatrician and pediatric critical care physician in Washington, D.C. told the Associated Press. “And if that infant has any sort of break in their skin — as infants, frankly, frequently do — they can then get hepatitis B.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy “retired” the 17 medical and technical experts on the ACIP soon after he took office. The new members, announced in June, include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses. She has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation, according to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another new ACIP member is Dr. Robert Malone, a former mRNA researcher who trades in conspiracy theories about the COVID pandemic, and who supports so-called alternative treatments for COVID and measles. Malone has stated people were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and he’s suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS, according to the AP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy was paid $20,000 a week for chairing the Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit that raises millions to support lawsuits against vaccine makers. According to Reuters, CHD brought 30 federal and state lawsuits since 2020, many challenging vaccines and public health mandates. Kennedy also earned millions as a consultant for law firms bringing those lawsuits, according to Politifact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Health Alert Network messages are sent through New Hampshire’s primary communication alerting system which rapidly pushes out health alerts via telephone, text message, fax, e-mail and pager. Participants include physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, hospital emergency departments, local health departments, local public health responders, public health volunteers, health officers, etc.,” according to the network’s website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enrollment in the NH-HAN is open to individuals who meet at least one of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recipient has a legal obligation to respond to a public health incident.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A public health incident is occurring in the recipient’s jurisdictional area.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipient’s participation is essential for completing a public health intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The cost of complying with current regulations for removing Pfas in drinking water is estimated at about $3.8bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are trying to put numbers on this and that’s important because when you want to clean up and regulate Pfas, there’s a real cost to it,” Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pfas are a class of at least 16,000 compounds often used to help products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pfas are widely used across the economy, and industrial sites that utilize them in high volume often pollute groundwater. Military bases and airports are among major sources of Pfas pollution because the chemicals are used in firefighting foam. The federal government &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/pfas-contaminating-drinking-water" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that about 95 million people across the country drink contaminated water from public or private wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/05/pfas-sperm-count-mobility-testicle-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raised concern&lt;/a&gt; about the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/forever-chemicals-found-umbilical-cord-blood-samples-studies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Pfas exposure&lt;/a&gt; on fetuses and newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among those are toxicological studies in which researchers examine the chemicals’ impact on lab animals, but that leaves some question about whether humans experience the same harms, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other studies are correlative and look at the levels of Pfas in umbilical cord blood or in newborns in relation to levels of disease. Lemoine said those findings are not always conclusive, in part because many variables can contribute to reproductive harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new natural study is unique because it gets close to “isolating the effect of the Pfas itself, and not anything around it”, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers achieved this by identifying 41 &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-hampshire" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; sites contaminated with Pfoa and Pfos, two common Pfas compounds, then using topography data to determine groundwater flow direction. The authors then examined reproductive outcomes among residents down gradient from the sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers chose New Hampshire because it is the only state where Pfas and reproductive data is available, Lemoine said. Well locations are confidential, so mothers were unaware of whether their water source was down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site. That created a randomization that allows for causal inference, the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study’s methodology is rigorous and unique, and underscores “that Pfas is no joke, and is toxic at very low concentrations”, said Sydney Evans, a senior science analyst with the Environmental Working Group non-profit. The group studies Pfas exposures and advocates for tighter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is in part effective because mothers did not know whether they were exposed, which created the randomization, Evans said, but she noted that the state has the information. The findings raise questions about whether the state should be doing a similar analysis and alerting mothers who are at risk, Evans said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemoine said the study had some limitations, including that authors don’t know the mothers’ exact exposure levels to Pfas, nor does the research account for other contaminants that may be in the water. But he added that the findings still give a strong picture of the chemicals’ effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Granular activated carbon or reverse osmosis systems can be used by water treatment plants and consumers at home to remove many kinds of Pfas, and those systems &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.5c00519" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;also remove other contaminants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Biden administration last year put in place limits in drinking water for six types of Pfas, and gave water utilities several years to install systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration is moving to undo the limits for some compounds. That would probably cost the public more in the long run. Utility customers pay the cost of removing Pfas, but the public “also pays the cost of drinking contaminated water, which is bigger”, Lemoine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 20:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOZTNyX3lvWmtjamNOTXhFLTMxZ3gtMjZQOEdRUGticlJ2dG9obVpueDVVdHh2Mzl3Ui1vZXBOOU9wc1c3RFNaVzBWenc3TDVrZ1o1YzZFZ0w4dlBvX05sUGF1ZXQxTnJ6YmM3OE1OX0RRQ1BnRk5VSlZueDIxZmNIT2RnQmFmX2VRSFhIME5WbUc1dFZn</guid></item></channel></rss>
