Some scientists have even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called inflammation&lt;/a&gt; “the cause of all diseases”. But what actually causes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and what fights it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some contexts, inflammation is good. When the body faces an acute threat – say, an ear infection or a sprained ankle, it responds with acute inflammation – an immune system process marked by fever, swelling and pain in the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global/2025/jul/22/how-to-fight-chronic-inflammation-free","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But in the face of chronic threats – say, from trauma or job stress, acute inflammation can become chronic, and the immune, stress and cardiometabolic responses can become dysregulated. Research links chronic inflammation with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24468642/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;low mood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25123210/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16525580/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cardiovascular risks&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/inflammation-depression-mind-body" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;depression and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing number of products and routines – like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/19/what-skincare-experts-do-to-their-skin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red light masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;de-puffing regimens&lt;/a&gt; – claim to fight the signs of inflammation. Many nutritional methods have proven to help chronic inflammation, too – such as eating &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a vegetable-heavy Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30412134/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3914936/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/30/inflation-healthy-food-eating-america" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/18/climate-diet-food-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access issues&lt;/a&gt; can get in the way of these solutions. Plus, they may not address a major root cause, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768696/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5476783/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; says chronic stress can induce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To prevent and manage chronic stress, more health professionals are offering “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/prescribed-time-in-nature-linked-to-improvements-in-anxiety-depression-and-blood-pressure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;”, or referrals to non-medical, community-based, de-stressing activities. Often, these activities are free or the costs are covered by another party, like an insurer or local non-profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="32a68415-fe99-4f21-bebf-b11936da351f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week.

But according to Dr Qing Li, professor of clinical medicine at Nippon Medical school in Tokyo, forest bathing can also help support healthy functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in controlling the stress and inflammation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Forest environments can promote relaxation and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ functions,” says Dr. Li. It can also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the “fight or flight” responses. By helping to prevent and manage stress, forest bathing can also help prevent and manage chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36328581/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;series of Li’s studies&lt;/a&gt; show that forest bathing can reduce the stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; similarly finds time in nature can reduce physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, and the perception of stress. One &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-20-minute-nature-break-relieves-stress?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found just 20 minutes of nature per day can make a difference in stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="engage-with-art-and-music" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Engage with art and music&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Art can also promote relief from chronic stress. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5004743/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults who participated in a 45-minute art-making session saw significantly lower levels of cortisol afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/18/truth-about-stress-benefits-of-the-good-kind-exercise-that-makes-it-worse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stress are related to a loss of control&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr Girija Kaimal, professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, who co-authored the study. Creating art helps us feel like “there’s something we have a sense of agency over” and “lets us take charge of the distress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study’s participants self-reported that they found art-making relaxing, enjoyable, “freeing from constraints”, and conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and self-discovery. “Distraction is a great initial coping mechanism to help us calm down after a stressful event, but art can help us dig deeper – it helps us pay attention to what distressed us, and it’ll help the next time something similar sets us off,” says Kaimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to create “the kind of art that speaks to you,” says Kaimal – whether it’s writing, dancing, or drawing – and skill level doesn’t matter. “You want to get into a judgment-free zone where you can play and have fun without consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing body of research suggests experiencing art, not just creating it, can also promote inflammation reduction. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167611/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779734/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found listening to music, for instance, can reduce blood pressure and cortisol. Researchers at the University of Florida have been documenting the &lt;a href="https://arts.ufl.edu/site/assets/files/188411/epiarts_table_final.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health benefits of engaging with the arts&lt;/a&gt;, with some studies suggesting just one to three hours of related activity per week can reduce risk of depression and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bodily movement was often linked with fighting a predator or fighting for our lives, says Dr. Michael Gleeson, emeritus professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University. “The body puts its survival first,” and temporarily inhibits the inflammatory response so it can use energy more efficiently, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In his co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3041" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, Gleeson suggests exercise not only induces an anti-inflammatory environment in the short-term, but may also reduce visceral fat mass in the long-term. The accumulation of visceral fat can drive and worsen chronic inflammation by promoting development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and other diseases linked to physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other research finds that exercise can significantly reduce production of &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01445-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like CRP and IL-6, and increase &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5883991/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To reap these and other benefits, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; adults spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate aerobic activity, like brisk walking and cycling, or 75 minutes on vigorous activity, like running, Zumba or sports. A longitudinal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961830538X?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; finds sports involving social interaction – such as tennis, badminton and soccer – are best at promoting health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-other-people" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Support other people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because cooperation with others has historically been essential for survival, our bodies have evolved to respond to the absence of social connections. The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2013.837379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;late neuroscientist Dr John Cacioppo&lt;/a&gt; compares this evolutionary response to hunger. Just as hunger signals the absence of energy and nutrients and cues the body to find food, loneliness signals the absence of social connections, and cues us to seek out or repair relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s why multiple studies link feelings of loneliness and social isolation to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130107/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;range of stress responses&lt;/a&gt;, including increased &lt;a href="https://pure.johnshopkins.edu/en/publications/getting-under-the-skin-social-isolation-and-biological-markers-in" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt; and dysregulated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19744794/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, studies link &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15473629/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high levels of social support &lt;/a&gt;to lower cortisol, and link social activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229892/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036113/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;giving social support&lt;/a&gt; to lower pro-inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="experience-awe" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Experience ‘awe’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within all of these activities, the experience of awe – a feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our current understanding of the world – can also reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jennifer Stellar, a professor of psychology at University of Toronto, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25603133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that links awe to greater positive affect and lower inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research is underway but Stellar suggests “that positive emotions can undo the effects of negative emotions, and negative emotions are associated with inflammation”. Another reason is that “awe makes us feel connected to others, and social connection has been documented to act as a buffer against inflammatory responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So how can you encounter awe? Her co-author, Dr Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at University of Berkeley California and renowned awe expert, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/02/awe-psychology-life-death-dacher-keltner" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that it can result from engagement with the “eight wonders of life”: the moral beauty of others, nature, collective movement, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, big ideas, and the cycle of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPR3lYaFpRWTRfZnhaUnRhdU9FbExTQXRhN3VKOWR2M2U4YTNjUkdGUzdaREo1U2wzVE5fYURXTUVFelRObGlnOWxaZWJJV1ZDM05tbFpBRXdnQ1IzZkxaM2lCbTJOeUN5RzF4aFNINVpMVmU1cEZJS0xJNGR5R1ZJQWdpWHg1TWg4TUhHc2lR</guid></item><item><title>饥饿锐化巩固记忆的睡眠节奏-神经科学新闻 | Hunger Sharpens Sleep Rhythms That Solidify Memories - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5HMllJOGF2TUlCeW5vT2xEdWpvamwxOFlzWWdWMS1VdU5KV1J0aHNJVXBmUFFYcU4wcHJBT3JBV04xQ0pOYXJYd0tTY1loLUszcVJKd3pHbW1FZ2V0THpXVXNuamtJNEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that the brain’s slow oscillations and sleep spindles — key rhythms that consolidate memories during sleep — can be shaped by more than just age. While these rhythms have long been thought of as stable traits, studies reveal that metabolic state, like fasting before sleep, can enhance their timing and co-occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting in rats boosted the density and synchronization of these sleep rhythms, aligning them for better memory consolidation.

The human brain, it seems, does some of its most important work while we’re unconscious: replaying, refining, and reinforcing the day’s experiences so they can be stored for the long term. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of this process involves two distinct patterns of brain activity unique to non-REM (NREM) sleep: slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111846"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg" alt="This shows a fork and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These electrical rhythms—large, slow waves paired with rapid, waxing-and-waning bursts—are thought to synchronize widespread brain regions and promote synaptic plasticity, the foundation of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, research has zeroed in on a crucial detail: it’s not just the presence of SOs and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindle-brain-health-28325/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spindles&lt;/a&gt; that matters, but the precise way they are timed together. This SO-spindle coupling, researchers argue, may be one of sleep’s most essential mechanisms for consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is this coupling a fixed feature of an individual’s sleep, like a fingerprint? Or is it flexible—capable of adjusting to recent experiences, such as what you’ve learned that day or even what you’ve eaten? A growing body of work is beginning to suggest the answer is more nuanced than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Rhythm of Memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/nrem-sleep-cognition-28118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NREM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, your brain cycles through patterns of silence and activity at about one cycle per second. These are the slow oscillations, sweeping waves of hyperpolarization (down states) and depolarization (up states) in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the thalamus generates spindles, brief bursts of higher-frequency activity in the 11–16 Hz range. When spindles are precisely timed to the upstate of a slow oscillation, the conditions are ideal for strengthening synaptic connections—a process believed to stabilize memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that this SO-spindle coupling declines with age and is associated with both memory decline and cognitive impairment. But what about day-to-day variability? Could an unusually rich day of learning, for example, “tune” your brain to couple SOs and spindles more tightly as you sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Trait vs. State Debate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this question, a research team studied 41 young adults over two nights: one after a word-pair learning task and one control night with no learning. Some participants learned a modest list of 40 word pairs, while others memorized 120, and one group had to meet a minimum recall standard. The researchers measured SO-spindle coupling across these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found no consistent differences in coupling strength between the learning and control nights—suggesting that pre-sleep learning alone may not significantly influence this aspect of sleep architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, within the group that reached a performance criterion, there was a correlation between memory performance and the &lt;em&gt;phase&lt;/em&gt; of SO-spindle coupling. This finding hints that while coupling may not change dramatically night-to-night, subtle aspects of its timing may still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered a robust link between the amount of spindle power and the preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling—echoing previous findings that this relationship varies with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results support the idea that SO-spindle coupling may have both trait-like stability (reflecting an individual’s typical sleep structure) and state-dependent fine-tuning influenced by experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Learning: How Metabolism Shapes Sleep Rhythms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not only learning, what else could shape SO-spindle coupling? One intriguing possibility is metabolic state. Recent work found that individuals with lower fasting glucose levels had stronger and more precise SO-spindle coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association persisted after controlling for many demographic and health factors, though it disappeared when diabetes status was accounted for—pointing to a complex link between glucose metabolism and sleep oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments provide even more direct evidence. In a study of adult rats, researchers manipulated metabolic state by fasting the animals for six hours before sleep or injecting them with glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting increased the density of both SOs and spindles, improved their co-occurrence, and shifted spindle timing closer to the upstate of the slow oscillation—an alignment thought to optimize memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucose injections, meanwhile, increased spindle density but didn’t affect SOs or their coupling. Importantly, these changes occurred without altering the overall amounts of NREM or REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that while age and baseline physiology set the stage, day-to-day factors like nutrition can modulate the fine structure of sleep rhythms, potentially enhancing the brain’s ability to consolidate memories overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Neurochemistry of Sleep Substates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more tantalizing is emerging evidence that NREM sleep itself isn’t uniform, but fluctuates through subtle substates over minutes at a time. These substates, identified in rodent studies, are defined by varying levels of neuromodulators like serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine—all of which are known to influence memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these slow neurochemical waves interact with the precise timing of SOs and spindles is still largely unknown, but understanding it could unlock deeper insights into how sleep supports memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reinforce the idea that SO-spindle coupling is a dynamic interplay between stable individual characteristics and flexible state-dependent factors. While your personal sleep architecture likely provides a consistent baseline, it can still adapt—at least subtly—to what you’ve learned, what you’ve eaten, and possibly other yet-unknown variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to optimize their &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindles-blood-sugar-23596/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep for better memory&lt;/a&gt;, this research offers some practical lessons: maintaining healthy metabolic habits may support more effective sleep-based memory consolidation. And it underscores the importance of high-quality sleep itself—not just quantity, but the integrity of its underlying rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is far from passive. It’s a highly orchestrated process that relies on the exquisite timing of electrical and chemical signals to reinforce what we’ve learned and prepare us for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By continuing to unravel how slow oscillations and spindles work together—and how they can be tuned by our daily experiences—scientists are bringing us closer to understanding how to make the most of our sleeping hours for our waking minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung, Network for Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience?&lt;/a&gt; ” by Niels Niethard. &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of newly encoded memories into long-term storage critically depends on plasticity processes during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that memory representations are facilitated by repeated reactivation of neuronal firing patterns during sleep, which promotes synaptic plasticity and thereby strengthens memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows that such memory reactivations occur during specific oscillatory patterns in the EEG that are unique to sleep (Brodt et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:23:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5HMllJOGF2TUlCeW5vT2xEdWpvamwxOFlzWWdWMS1VdU5KV1J0aHNJVXBmUFFYcU4wcHJBT3JBV04xQ0pOYXJYd0tTY1loLUszcVJKd3pHbW1FZ2V0THpXVXNuamtJNEk</guid></item><item><title>Lizzo认为这种按摩有助于她的身体转变-背后有真正的科学- AOL.com | Lizzo Credits This Type Of Massage For Helping With Her Body Transformation—And There's Real Science Behind It - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Lizzo Saw This Beauty Expert To Get Cover Ready&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images/Flavia Lanini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo is many things—a singer, a songwriter, an actor, and, now, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a65192751/lizzo-transformation-health-journey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a cover star;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a cover star&lt;/a&gt;. When the entertainer, who's birth name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson, appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Women's Health&lt;/em&gt; Summer 2025 issue, she appeared fit, healthy, and at peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last few years have been transformative for the 37-year-old, both inside &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; out. Lizzo is quick to point out that her &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a65319688/lizzo-fuel-like-healthy-eating-habits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:body reinvention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;body reinvention&lt;/a&gt; is not the result of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a43557514/ozempic-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; or weight loss surgery, but rather diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes. She loads up on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g44560437/healthy-sheet-pan-dinners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein-rich meals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein-rich meals&lt;/a&gt;, works out five days per week, hosts spiritual retreats...and relies on some help from a very special friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four-time Grammy winner has been outspoken on social media about the pivotal role celebrity &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a32171081/lymphatic-drainage-massage/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lymphatic drainage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lymphatic drainage&lt;/a&gt; specialist &lt;a href="https://flavialanini.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flavia Lanini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flavia Lanini&lt;/a&gt; has played in her wellness journey. She's a regular at Lanini’s eponymous Beauty Institute in Beverly Hills, indulging in her signature detox treatment once or twice weekly. The results speak for themselves, as seen in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:before and after;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;before and after&lt;/a&gt; phot0 posted to Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, it all comes to down to Lizzo’s dedication and effort—and their ongoing relationship. “I always tell my clients that they really need to trust in the process and trust &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. If that happens, I can deliver results—and I’m so happy with Lizzo’s results,” she says. “We took a different approach to weight loss than she ever had before, using holistic treatments and targeting all-around health.” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, more on exactly what Lanini did to have Lizzo looking—and feeling—good as hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The woman behind the woman. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, Lizzo first came to see her about a year ago, with the goal of both losing weight and improving her overall health. “We really wanted to take the natural approach because she hates needles and can’t handle pain,” she says. That meant regular &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64653766/benefits-of-sauna/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sauna sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sauna sessions&lt;/a&gt;, drinking Lanini’s detoxifying teas, several non-invasive muscle- and skin-tightening treatments, and a re-framing of her attitude toward food and nutrition. At the crux of their protocol? Lanini’s signature detox treatment. “This was really the best process for Lizzo because it helped boost her metabolism so much. We started doing it once or twice per week,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brazilian-born Lanini is a lymphatic drainage expert, and lymphatic drainage is involved, the treatment is far more than that. “My technique is different because of my background and training. Being an esthetician in Brazil is nothing like being an esthetician here. I went to university for five years to earn my degree, and then spent 11 years working with doctors,” she explains. In fact, a similar protocol is even used on cancer patients in Brazil to help detox the body in between treatment rounds, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, an ultrasound treatment on the abdomen to help stimulate digestion. “Think of your gut as an apple tree. The ultrasound works to shake it and remove the ‘apples,’ the build-up on the gut lining,” she explains. This not only helps get things moving, so to speak, but also boosts metabolism and can even help combat brain fog. When your body doesn’t need to expend energy cleaning the gut, it can focus that energy elsewhere, Lanini claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step two involves a head-to-toe rubdown. Rather than relying on traditional lymphatic drainage techniques (more on those in a moment), Lanini’s method focuses on relaxing the fascia around the muscle to improve the muscle’s functionality and movement, in turn stimulating the lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massage is paired with Lanini’s proprietary topical sculpting cream featuring guarana, a caffeine-rich Brazilian plant. Post-massage, the cream is mixed with different salts and clay and applied underneath a wrap to boost additional detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a 20-minute sauna session, Lanini's clients sip on a detoxifying, lymph-supporting tea, which also boasts Brazilian ingredients including acai, guarana, and hibiscus, among others. “It helps keep the body balanced, combats gut inflammation, and acts as electrolytes while you’re in the sauna,” Lanini explains, who adds that Lizzo drinks the tea twice daily. When all is said and done, clients feel lighter, less bloated, sleep better, and have improved energy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was Lizzo’s standard regimen, Lanini upped the ante before a big event, like the Met Gala (or our cover shoot). “When she wanted to be even more snatched we’d do the detox treatment three days in a row. You really do end up with a completely different body,” Lanini says. She adds that because Lizzo was also concerned with loose skin after losing so much weight, they also incorporated VelaShape, which tightens the skin using radiofrequency and other energy modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing it all home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those of us who can’t see Lanini regularly? Even the much more widely-available, traditional lymphatic drainage massages can help improve both health and aesthetic appearance. “Think of the lymphatic system as your body’s waste management system,” says Andy Wood, a masseuse specializing in lymphatic drainage massage at Chicago’s &lt;a href="https://milkandhoneyspa.com/locations/gold-coast-chicago/chicago-gold-coast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milk + Honey Spa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milk + Honey Spa&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to move and flush out a variety of toxins and debris, including excess fluid, cellular waste, viruses and more, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike blood, which is pumped by the heart, there’s nothing actually pumping the lymphatic system. It moves when we move, or as a result of gravity, compression, or manual stimulation, adds Morgana Kemper, owner of &lt;a href="https://labrasileiramassage.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:La Brasiliera;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;La Brasiliera&lt;/a&gt;, a spa specializing in Brazilian lymphatic drainage massage with locations in Charlotte and Chicago. Lymphatic drainage massage is a way of manually boosting the lymphatic system and is ideal for combatting swelling and strengthening immunity, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as aesthetics go, it’s important to point out that lymphatic drainage massage alone isn’t going to &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;cause any kind of real weight loss, Wood says. Rather, when paired with diet and exercise (as in Lizzo’s case), it can help enhance the effects and appearance of that weight loss, he explains. Still, because it does flush out excess fluid, it can help make the body, particularly the abdomen, appear slimmer and more contoured, Kemper says. And while lymphatic drainage is generally very gentle (think subtle tapping and soft, sweeping motions), Brazilian techniques in particular can be a bit firmer and help redistribute fat cells for an even greater contouring effect, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, both experts we spoke with say getting a lymphatic drainage massage monthly is ideal for those looking to make it a part of their wellness or weight loss routine. Can’t get to the spa? Kemper is a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61973861/best-rebounding-workouts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trampoline rebounding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;trampoline rebounding&lt;/a&gt;: “It can make the lymphatic system flow 15 times faster,” she says. Or, try &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64523152/what-is-dry-brushing/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=20192787275&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACrQpnxzZaR2nlkmsMjHsOjBJ52ib&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyvfDBhDYARIsAItzbZGDGU0-U7kQyt2tJrZl3vVCOOiHAap-L5OcoRrtx7phB7-LakxcH7AaAkniEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dry brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dry brushing&lt;/a&gt;, another easy, at-home, lymph-boosting option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The picture-perfect proof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Lizzo is the best advertisement for an integrative, holistic approach as the gateway to healthy, long-lasting changes. “Not only has she lost half of her body weight, she’s also so much more conscious of her health now.

			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-cocktail-extends-mouse-lifespan-by-about-30-percent?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Anti-Aging Cocktail Extends Mouse Lifespan by About 30 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right.

This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure.

We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging, even if slightly, are immense," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2023.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I have low serum cholesterol but a high coronary calcium score, and I was told to take magnesium supplements to bring my calcium score down (in addition to daily aspirin and a statin). What are your thoughts about magnesium to bring down a high calcium score? -- D.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EPM4DYX4GVEKZGZ6GCT3Z5R6JE"&gt;ANSWER: A coronary calcium score is a measurement of calcium in the blood vessels of the heart. High coronary calcium scores predict an increased likelihood of blockages in the blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NZ7LHZUP4JCRRDYU2WQKUNU3WQ"&gt;The literature is mixed about whether a high magnesium intake can reduce the risk of coronary calcium and, in theory, reduce heart disease risk. Most of the evidence suggests that high blood magnesium levels reduce heart disease risk. However, people with higher magnesium levels are more likely to be consuming a healthier diet, which is known to reduce heart disease risk by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RGLA72QGQJFQVLUJXEHIEARPOA"&gt;To be sure that magnesium helps prevent heart disease, a future large trial could give half the subjects a magnesium supplement and the other half an identical-appearing pill without magnesium, then follow the groups to see which is more likely to get heart disease. These types of trials are difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and they have not yet been done for magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZJTCYIGRJNA43GNLY5JEQRZ7VM"&gt;However, you already have coronary calcium, so you are at a higher risk for a heart attack. Studies that have looked at the use of magnesium supplementation to prevent a heart attack in people with known or suspected blockages haven’t consistently found a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DQK47HMYF5FPHDHZFILIYHRQAI"&gt;This is in contrast to statin trials, which have universally shown a reduction in heart attack rates in people with coronary blockages or those who are at a very high risk. Statins are effective at reducing risk for people with known blockages in their arteries, even if they have normal cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B4ZVP2R3PZARDLDH24GLOPPHME"&gt;Having a low cholesterol level reduces but does not eliminate the risk for blockages. About 30% of people with coronary disease have normal cholesterol.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 &lt;strong&gt;Groundbreaking IVF technique&lt;/strong&gt; successfully delivers eight healthy babies in the UK, free from severe mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌟 The new method, called &lt;strong&gt;Mitochondrial Donation Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;, uses DNA from three sources to prevent the transmission of harmful mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👶 Significant reduction in &lt;strong&gt;mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed, with all children healthy at birth and minimal health issues reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Despite its success, this procedure remains &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; and unapproved in many countries, sparking ethical debates on genetic intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advancements in in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology have once again brought hope and joy to families worldwide. In a remarkable achievement, United Kingdom doctors have successfully delivered eight healthy babies using an innovative DNA-enhanced IVF method. This groundbreaking technique, aimed at preventing the transmission of severe mitochondrial diseases, has proven effective in giving these children a disease-free start in life. The news not only marks a significant milestone in reproductive medicine but also raises intriguing ethical and scientific discussions about the future of genetic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Mitochondrial Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria, often referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;powerhouses of the cell&lt;/strong&gt;, play a crucial role in energy production. Despite their small size, they contain a separate set of DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA inherited from both parents. When mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, it can lead to serious health issues. These mutations can severely affect energy supply to vital organs such as the heart, muscles, and brain, often resulting in developmental delays and a shortened lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, around &lt;strong&gt;one in 5,000 newborns&lt;/strong&gt; are affected by these debilitating conditions, experiencing symptoms like vision loss and muscle weakening. The recent breakthrough in IVF technology, known as Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), offers a promising solution. By utilizing healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, this technique aims to eliminate the risk of inheriting such diseases, providing a healthier future for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cM5cjTCL7P"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/its-like-teleporting-knowledge-this-breakthrough-optical-ai-chip-transfers-100-million-books-in-just-7-minutes-using-light-speed-data/"&gt;“It’s Like Teleporting Knowledge”: This Breakthrough Optical AI Chip Transfers 100 Million Books in Just 7 Minutes Using Light-Speed Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Innovative Three-source Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new IVF technique, known as &lt;strong&gt;Pronuclear Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;, involves a revolutionary approach to conception. By combining DNA from three sources—the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm, and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor—this method ensures that the child inherits the vast majority of their traits from their biological parents. However, they also receive a small fraction (approximately 0.1%) of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This genetic alteration, while minute, is significant enough to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from an egg with a mitochondrial DNA mutation into a donor egg with its nucleus removed. The resulting embryo, which contains the parents’ nuclear DNA and the donor’s healthy mitochondrial DNA, is then implanted, leading to a successful pregnancy. This approach not only offers hope for affected families but also opens new doors in the field of genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zIWn6ShkUq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/nvidia-helix-destroys-ai-lag-forever-ultra-powerful-system-instantly-transforms-stalled-chatbots-into-million-word-lightning-fast-assistants-for-us-businesses/"&gt;“NVIDIA Helix Destroys AI Lag Forever”: Ultra-Powerful System Instantly Transforms Stalled Chatbots Into Million-Word, Lightning-Fast Assistants for US Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Promising Results and Ongoing Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study have been overwhelmingly positive, with a &lt;strong&gt;95-100% reduction in mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed in six of the babies. The remaining two showed a substantial reduction of 77-88%, well below the threshold for disease manifestation. All eight children were healthy at birth, with only minor, treatable health issues reported in a few cases. This success demonstrates the potential of the technique to transform lives, offering a disease-free future to children who might otherwise face severe health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its success, the procedure remains controversial and is not yet approved in many countries, including the US and France. Ethical objections include concerns about the destruction of human embryos and fears of the emergence of “designer babies.” These debates underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of genetic intervention, even as science continues to push boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hpe0Pfyv7f"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/it-transforms-while-flying-engineers-create-shape-shifting-robot-that-morphs-mid-air-to-land-and-roll-on-wheels/"&gt;“It Transforms While Flying”: Engineers Create Shape-Shifting Robot That Morphs Mid-Air to Land and Roll on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Considerations and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any groundbreaking scientific advancement, the development of MDT has sparked ethical debates. Critics argue that altering the genetic makeup of embryos raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the moral implications of such interventions. Supporters, however, emphasize the profound impact this technology can have on families affected by mitochondrial diseases, offering them a chance at a healthier future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of this procedure have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific and ethical considerations involved. As the technique continues to evolve, it will be crucial for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public to engage in open dialogues about the responsible use of genetic technologies. How will society balance the potential benefits of these advances with the ethical considerations they entail?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Italy, health authorities have reported the first locally acquired cases of both dengue and chikungunya, specifically in the Emilia-Romagna region (Pictured: Rimini, Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both of the mosquito-borne viruses are typically found in tropical regions like South America and India &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Italian health officials also reported the first locally acquired case of Chikungunya for the year, again found in the Emilia-Romagna region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional 50 imported cases of the virus were recorded across a number of regions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, holidaymakers jetting off to France were warned they were at risk of contracting chikungunya after&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14875285/warning-virus-Chikungunya-Europe-summer-hotspot-mosquitoes-France.html"&gt; eight local cases were recorded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chikungunya outbreak has occurred far earlier in the year than is typical, and this could indicate the mosquitoes that carry chikungunya are becoming increasingly at home in France thanks to climate change, the warning said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though not fatal, chikungunya can cause a range of effects, which are primarily marked by a sudden onset of fever and severe joint pain, while other common symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the acute phase of the illness usually resolves within a week or two, the joint pain can persist for weeks, months, or even years in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, dengue fever can cause a range of effects, including mild flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in some cases, infections can progress to severe dengue, which can cause potentially life-threatening complications such as internal bleeding and organ damage, and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Nassau County Health Department reports that there have been 25 positive rabies tests since last July. This marks the worst the situation has been in nearly a decade, since the county announced it had eradicated terrestrial rabies in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Most of the cases in Nassau are among raccoons and feral cats, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;a href="https://longisland.news12.com/health-officials-sixth-rabid-raccoon-found-in-amityville-area-this-year"&gt;In May, the Suffolk County Health Department &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;said it had identified six positive rabies cases in raccoons and all in Amityville. News 12 reached out early this morning for an update on rabies statistics in Suffolk County but has not yet heard back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adobe-dc-view-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say avoid feeding or touching wild animals or stray cats and dogs, make sure your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and keep pets indoors at night. Anyone who is bitten or scratched by an animal should seek immediate medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabies is a serious viral disease that affects the nervous system in mammals, including humans. While preventable by quickly vaccinating after an exposure, it is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Friday, the state Health Department issued a warning and urged New Yorkers to take steps to prevent rabies infections during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabid animals have been found in all counties in New York, officials said. Last year, the state's Wadsworth Center Rabies Laboratory confirmed rabies in 313 wild and domestic animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Nassau Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman will hold a media availability to discuss the rabies declaration issued by the Health Department today at the Theodore Roosevelt Executive and Legislative Building in Mineola at 11 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:10:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRVR6NFMwUHEtNmVyTHVoNHdtQUUzQnFWN0padmlyUElxa2RHT0NqQzRuRXVuYmJLelJjR2hObnItNE4zX185WHdoZDFQWjN3WEtnOXFjVFpZSEc3RG5ySDFaczRlQXV0SnY1dnY5WElweS1vTXRhalBhU2ZHcDZwc09jd0pjWDM2TmRFbF9HOUgzVnhsZEgyaUR3</guid></item><item><title>随着年龄的增长，我如何锻炼肌肉？ -《纽约时报》 | How Can I Build Muscle as I Age? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPdWJ0QTQ2OTYxdnB5UGdILTl3RmhNYk42UlpXYUxGUTFnSEZjNDRNdjIwaFpMWVg1VW1RZTdpTTFVTk8teE9DYzdHTWo1emlMOGlGT1JJQzFlQjN3RmxraGRyUnBaZXo3a2VseFJYWTV4Z1FpbUlsSEVzV3J6U2d5aA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPdWJ0QTQ2OTYxdnB5UGdILTl3RmhNYk42UlpXYUxGUTFnSEZjNDRNdjIwaFpMWVg1VW1RZTdpTTFVTk8teE9DYzdHTWo1emlMOGlGT1JJQzFlQjN3RmxraGRyUnBaZXo3a2VseFJYWTV4Z1FpbUlsSEVzV3J6U2d5aA</guid></item><item><title>许多肺癌现在都在非吸烟者中。科学家们想知道为什么。-《纽约时报》 | Many Lung Cancers Are Now in Nonsmokers.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dopamine is one of the most extensively studied chemical messengers in the human brain, and yet scientists are still figuring out how it works to accomplish so much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, the classic view has been that, when released, dopamine slowly diffuses through the brain like a chemical megaphone, broadcasting information far and wide to numerous target cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recently, however, that perspective has changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.01.001"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newer research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that dopamine is also capable of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41972-6"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01803-8"&gt;sharp&lt;/a&gt; whispers, precisely directed within milliseconds to neighboring cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If researchers are right, this localized signal could be a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;fundamental building block&lt;/a&gt;" that's overlooked in the brain's dopamine system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-seems-to-have-a-blocking-effect-on-dopamine-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Caffeine Seems to Have a Blocking Effect on Dopamine, And Here's Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine in the brain is different to dopamine in the rest of the body. In the blood, dopamine helps modulate the function of multiple organs as well as our immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, it's a chemical messenger involved in mediating a diversity of animal behaviors &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from movement and mood to sleep and memory to reward and motivation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neurons that release dopamine are known to do so with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx6367"&gt;&lt;span&gt;different firing patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and yet it's not clear what messages these specific signals encode, or why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ability to send both fast &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; slow signals could explain how the brain's dopamine system can achieve so much with such specificity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png" alt="Dopamin Pathway" class="size-medium wp-image-168136" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-603x415.png 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-768x529.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-1536x1058.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-600x413.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The main dopamine pathway in the brain.

B&lt;/span&gt;roader dopamine release, meanwhile, is widespread and elicits a slower response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our current research found that dopamine signaling and transmission in the brain is much more complex than we thought," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; pharmacologist Christopher Ford from the University of Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We knew that dopamine plays a role in many different behaviors, and our work gives the beginning of a framework for understanding how all those different behaviors could all be regulated by dopamine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The specific neurons studied by Ford and colleagues come from the brain's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"&gt;&lt;span&gt;striatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – a part of the basal ganglia involved in motor and reward systems that is rich in dopamine-releasing neurons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The striatum receives dopamine inputs from various parts of the brain, and it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.12.004"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.033"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-024-03165-7"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parkinson's disease, for instance, is marked by a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;degeneration of dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt; connecting to the striatum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how dopamine sends signals in this part of the brain could be crucial for coming up with new treatments for a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are really only at the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand how dysfunctions in dopamine contribute to diseases like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or addiction," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"More work is needed to grasp how these specific changes in dopamine signaling are affected in these different neurological and psychiatric diseases."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He even went to see massage therapists and other physical therapists, but nothing helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was until he discovered a move called the reverse Jefferson curl, which he describes as a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-reverse-jefferson-curl"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reverse Jefferson curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move stretches and strengthens the muscles in the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found this movement late into my own rehab process after two years of persistent low back pain,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t a magic fix, but once I introduced it consistently—two to three times per week—I started noticing real improvements over a couple of months. It became a key part of the bigger picture that helped me recover.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move is particularly great for pain related to “tissue obstruction [after injury], segmental stiffness, or lack of posterior chain control”, according to Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5Li3Gi5AhL49zAVX2f5NGQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5Li3Gi5AhL49zAVX2f5NGQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-form-tips"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Form tips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner demonstrates the move in his Instagram reel above, but it’s important to do it with correct form to avoid injury, so we asked him for some extra tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For beginners, I recommend starting against a wall with your hands supporting your hips from behind,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focus on segmental spinal control first—no weight, slow tempo, and small range,” Kooner adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once comfortable, you can add resistance gradually,” he says. “I used only 3lbs in a backpack, and I wouldn’t suggest going above 10–15lbs, even at more advanced stages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete up to 10 repetitions, four to six times per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-the-reverse-jefferson-curl-is-so-great-for-combating-back-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why the reverse Jefferson curl is so great for combating back pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The spine is designed to move and bear load in all directions,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving your back muscles in different directions is key to improving mobility, flexibility and dealing with stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise helps improve spinal flexion strength and control, which are often neglected in rehab and training programs,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t try this exercise if your pain is severe or you have a specific injury. Consult a doctor before trying it and don't continue with the exercise if it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, three years later, he is not only healthy and thriving, but his brain cancer has completely ‘vanished’!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, 40-year-old Ben Trotman was diagnosed with terminal glioblastoma, the most common and deadliest form of brain cancer that typically carries a grim prognosis with a median survival of just 12–18 months. Yet, over two years after receiving a single dose of ipilimumab before standard care, Trotman reportedly remains cancer-free and healthy as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the care of consultant oncologist Dr. Paul Mulholland at UCLH (University College London Hospital), Trotman became part of an NHS-funded trial that administers ipilimumab, a checkpoint inhibitor designed to boost the immune system, before traditional surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, his scans show no signs of recurrence, an unprecedented outcome in glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The medical marvel&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new clinical trial for the most deadly type of brain cancer, glioblastoma, which helped Ben with another shot at life, is looking for patients to join after an incredible success story. Organized by the NHS, this study aims to enroll 16 people over 18 months and is dedicated to Baroness Margaret McDonagh, who lost her battle with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma will receive an immunotherapy drug called ipilimumab before starting standard treatments, making the most of their immune systems when they are at their strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is being led by experts at University College London Hospital’s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. It follows a previous study with the same drug, which had to close because not enough patients joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial honors the late Baroness Margaret McDonagh’s memory and, like Trotman, participants receive ipilimumab to prime their immune defenses, with hopes of replicating his reassuring response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ipilimumab: The key behind the breakthrough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, an immune checkpoint. In cancers like melanoma, it enhances T-cell activity, enabling the body to attack tumors. When used before standard glioblastoma therapy, it primes the immune system to better target cancer cells. In Trotman’s case, it appears to have either eradicated or dramatically controlled his tumor, an outcome never before reported in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “window-of-opportunity” pre-treatment approach is groundbreaking. By delivering immunotherapy before surgery, it maximizes immune activation and potentially aids post-operative cancer control, a novel strategy in glioblastoma care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is glioblastoma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma, previously known as glioblastoma multiforme or GBM, is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain cancer in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma originates from astrocytes, a type of glial cell that supports nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Glioblastoma is classified as a Grade IV tumor, meaning it's highly aggressive, grows rapidly, and infiltrates surrounding brain tissue. The exact cause of most glioblastomas is unknown. However, it is understood that the disease develops when brain cells undergo DNA mutations that cause them to grow and multiply uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis for glioblastoma is generally poor, with a median survival of about 12-18 months after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate is around 5%, meaning about 5% of patients are still alive five years after their diagnosis. Glioblastoma almost always recurs despite maximal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, Trotman’s cancer-free scans more than two years post-treatment represent a hopeful breakthrough. It suggests that bolstering immune readiness before conventional treatment might overcome glioblastoma’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The success story&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success story comes from Ben Trotman, who was diagnosed in October 2022 at the age of 40. Now, at 43, two years and eight months after his treatment, his scans are clear, and there are no traces of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Mulholland, the consultant medical oncologist who is leading this new trial and treated Ben, as reported by The Independent, shared, “It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumor that was initially visible on scans. We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumor at bay – and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben's life has changed significantly since his diagnosis; he got married to Emily just two months after receiving the immunotherapy treatment, and in April, they welcomed their daughter, Mabel. Emily expressed the emotional toll of Ben's diagnosis, saying, “Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience. We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. Had we not met Dr. Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the immunotherapy, Ben went on to have the standard treatments of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He continues to have quarterly scans, which remain clear. Ben reflected on their journey, stating, “We obviously don’t know what the future holds, but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and me a bit of hope. We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dame Siobhain McDonagh MP led a successful fundraising campaign that gathered over £1 million to support this new trial. Her sister, Baroness McDonagh, sadly passed away from glioblastoma in 2023. Dame Siobhain shared, “My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma. Changing this was Margaret’s final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory. I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret, who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret’s Trial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mulholland is also thankful for Margaret and Siobhain’s dedication, stating, “When I met Margaret, she said to me, ‘What can I do to support you to cure this disease?’. I am incredibly grateful to her and to Siobhain, whose campaigning and fundraising in her sister’s memory have led to this new clinical trial opening for patients with this most aggressive form of brain cancer that has such a poor prognosis, with most patients surviving just nine months after diagnosis. The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy. We’re taking everything we have learned from previous trials into this new study, and we are already planning follow-on trials. My aim is to find a cure for glioblastoma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s ahead?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Mulholland, the trial is expanding enrollment, aiming to confirm both safety and effectiveness. Currently, the National Brain Appeal is funding two positions to support Dr. Mulholland’s vital research. The treatment will take place at the NIHR UCLH’s Clinical Research Facility and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. Patients who are interested in participating in the new Win-Glio trial should discuss it with their consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 03:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>可以揭示衰老真相的5个问题- ScienceAlert | 5 Questions That Could Reveal a Truth About Your Aging - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOQVF6dVdFb1BVLUk4c25jYXJ6dUhQcjFNdDl6VnMyTnBNVjMzZlZaQ3FpUXJPNXFKVXBTMkU3QmRteHFxaS1iS1lwemdBR0hVWDljT0pBeC1xWDBMcUloU3ZCT0wzMUhXeDhNdFQ4WllSMm5Qemo2a01tQ29NUWRkYlBpU1lYT2p3bkhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Most of us want to enjoy later life feeling strong, connected, and mentally sharp. But how often do we stop to think about whether the things we're doing right now are helping us get there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new quiz – which we have developed as part of the &lt;a href="https://wels.open.ac.uk/research/projects/take-5"&gt;Take Five to Age Well&lt;/a&gt; project, a free, expert-led, month-long challenge from The Open University and Age UK – makes it easier, and more empowering, to ask that question, reflect and take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy ageing doesn't depend on just one thing. Research shows that our long-term wellbeing is shaped by a mix of physical, mental and social factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-explains-how-you-can-assess-whether-youre-aging-well?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Expert Explains How You Can Assess Whether You're Aging Well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why experts, including us, have identified five key areas – known as the &lt;a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/health-sports-psychology/mental-health/five-pillars-ageing-well"&gt;Five Pillars for Ageing Well&lt;/a&gt; – that form a strong foundation for staying well and thriving in later life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Are you eating well?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eating-a-balanced-diet/"&gt;fruit and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078476"&gt;limiting ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and meeting your body's changing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6489487/"&gt;nutritional needs&lt;/a&gt;? Diets like the &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02772-3"&gt;Mediterranean plan&lt;/a&gt; are linked with a &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02772-3"&gt;lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malnutrition is &lt;a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/conditions-illnesses/malnutrition/"&gt;a serious concern&lt;/a&gt; in older age, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5389428/"&gt;maintaining strong muscles&lt;/a&gt; and bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Are you staying hydrated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10925/dietary-reference-intakes-for-water-potassium-sodium-chloride-and-sulfate"&gt;drinking enough water&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/six-ways-to-look-after-your-brain-health-in-your-20s-and-30s-231119"&gt;support both your brain and body&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dont-like-drinking-plain-water-10-healthy-ideas-for-staying-hydrated-this-summer-191859"&gt;Dehydration can creep up&lt;/a&gt; easily and affect cognitive function, mood and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/data-statistics/sugar-sweetened-beverages-intake.html#:%7E:text=Frequently%20drinking%20sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages,gout%2C%20a%20type%20of%20arthritis."&gt;Cutting down on sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt; can help you to maintain a healthy weight and staying within &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/"&gt;recommended alcohol limits&lt;/a&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;help lower your risk&lt;/a&gt; of conditions like dementia. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/older-people-need-to-stay-hydrated-heres-how-128420"&gt;Hydration really matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with life-limiting illnesses or conditions such as advanced dementia, where appetite and oral intake may be severely reduced, sugary drinks may be one of the few sources of calories they can tolerate. In these cases, hydration and comfort take priority over strict nutritional guidelines, and personalised care plans should always guide decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Are you being physically active?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you moving regularly? Enough to raise your heart rate? Are you breaking up long periods of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/why-sitting-too-much-is-bad-for-us/#:%7E:text=Studies%20have%20linked%20being%20inactive,and%20break%20down%20body%20fat."&gt;sitting with movement&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sedentary lifestyle is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7700832/"&gt;linked to a wide range&lt;/a&gt; of health risks. Simple habits &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/walking-for-health/"&gt;like walking&lt;/a&gt; more can boost physical fitness, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6481600/"&gt;sharpen the mind&lt;/a&gt; and help &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteoporosis/prevention/"&gt;prevent osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, especially when &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39322861/"&gt;paired with good nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Are you connecting socially?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you keeping in touch with others, spending time in your community and enjoying meaningful connection? Loneliness &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/mental-and-emotional-health/depression-and-older-adults"&gt;increases the risk&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="168693" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9995915/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building strong social ties earlier in life &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667032121000275"&gt;can help protect wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-loneliness-really-as-damaging-to-your-health-as-smoking-15-cigarettes-a-day-204959"&gt;the long term&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Are you challenging your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you keeping your mind active by learning, reading, &lt;a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/playing-instrument-linked-better-brain-health-older-adults"&gt;playing an instrument&lt;/a&gt;, or trying something new? &lt;a href="https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/joga/2/1/article-p98.xml"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that learning about your interests, activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885259/"&gt;crossword puzzles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2159676X.2017.1348387"&gt;new physical activities&lt;/a&gt; can keep the brain healthy and potentially delay dementia. There's no magic fix, but &lt;a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/health-sports-psychology/mental-health/five-pillars-ageing-well"&gt;even small actions&lt;/a&gt; can have lasting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed the Take Five to Age Well quiz to help people reflect on how they're doing across these five areas – and where there might be room to grow. The follow-up resources are based on real-life experiences of ageing from diverse communities and offer small, achievable steps you can start today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many online quizzes, this one doesn't just score you – it supports you. After signing up to the month-long challenge and taking the quiz, the Take Five to Age Well participants receive tips, encouragement and expert-led advice supporting participants' current habits and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've also partnered with BridgitCare – organisation that works with Councils, the NHS and Carer Charities across the UK, to help identify carers and scale the support provided with the use of technology – to create &lt;a href="https://agewell.bridgit.care/"&gt;Age Well&lt;/a&gt;, a free, web-based tool offering personalised daily actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to add more greens to your plate, look for expert tips, and easy ways to stay in control of your health, hobbies, and wellbeing or swap ten minutes of scrolling for a short walk, every step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age Well can also connect you to local groups and services to help turn good intentions into lasting routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/pL9ypOX3BBA?feature=shared"&gt;Healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt; isn't just about avoiding illness – it's about learning how to age well, maintaining independence, confidence and quality of life. And with an ageing population, learning that supports all taking proactive steps to protect our mental and physical health is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part? Many of the most effective actions are small and realistic. You don't have to run marathons or give up everything you enjoy. Take Five to Age Well meets you where you are – and helps you build a future where you feel stronger, more connected and better supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter your age, it's never too early – or too late – to start your journey to ageing well.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256381/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of COVID-19 cases in Hawaii is rising again, prompting a message of vigilance from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today reported the statewide test positivity rate — or percentage of all tests that are positive — at 12.4% as of Saturday, up from 10.9% the previous week. DOH said the virus is circulating at higher levels than expected, based on historic trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH noted the 7-day average of new cases also rose on all islands over the last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend is in line with a rising number of COVID cases across more than half of the U.S., including in more than 25 states — with some experts dubbing it a summer wave. Hawaii is one of 10 states where COVID cases are definitely growing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with Texas, Iowa, and Virginia, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest CDC models show two new variants growing dominant in the U.S., including NB.1.8.1, nicknamed Nimbus, widely reported to cause “razor blade throat” symptoms, and XFG, nicknamed Stratus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization is monitoring both, which experts said have not been shown to be more deadly than previous ones. Both are considered descendants of omicron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase reminds us that COVID-19 remains a health concern in the community,” state health officials in a news release. “At the moment, COVID-19 is outpacing flu and RSV in test positivity, emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The public is reminded to take reasonable precautions to avoid getting sick. Consult your doctor about vaccinations for yourself and your family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine is recommended for higher-risk populations including children ages 6 months to 2 years old; those ages 2 to 64 who are immuno-compromised; adults ages 65 and older; pregnant women; and health care workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials also recommend staying home when sick, covering one’s cough, and wearing a well-fitted mask while infected or recovering from COVID or when indoors with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Brown, an infectious diseases expert who continues tracking COVID trends, noted cases on Oahu rose from 25 a day last week to 40 a day this week. Emergency department visits for COVID in Hawaii have also been on the rise, and wastewater concentration levels for COVID have been “very high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH is updating its &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/current-situation-in-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;COVID-19 dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in a gap in data viewable to the public over the past few weeks. The weekly average of COVID patients hospitalized, at 20, has not been updated since June 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH says additional features to its COVID dashboard are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar. But new research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body's most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain's security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients. The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Study Reveals How This Artificial Sweetener May Cause Heart Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body's natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells' ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol's effect on the blood vessels' ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body's natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a "clot buster" called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke. But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced "blood vessel on a chip" systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar's sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It's now found in thousands of products, especially in many "sugar-free" and "keto-friendly" foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A man reaching for a protein bar in a shop." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such a protein bars.

But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even "natural" sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="168676" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain's protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261500/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A single drop in daily insulin can mean trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That story has shaped treatment for nearly a century, and in many places, it works. Yet most of the data behind that story comes from Europe and North America. What if a different chapter has been unfolding elsewhere all along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinics across &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;, nurses have long whispered to visiting researchers that some young patients labeled “type 1” seemed to hold on without insulin for weeks, even months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunch was hard to test – supplies are scarce, and lab work can be expensive – but the anecdotes kept piling up. Those whispers have now turned into evidence, and the findings are shaking up what we thought we knew &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;about diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-african-clinic-data"&gt;Surprising African clinic data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 900 children, teens, and young adults in Cameroon, Uganda, and South Africa joined a project called the Young-Onset Diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05013346?tab=table" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YODA&lt;/a&gt;) study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples, genetic scans, and clinical histories poured in. The results, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;, were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of participants lacked the autoimmune fingerprints that define classic type 1 diabetes, and the usual high-risk immune genes were missing as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 8.5 percent carried more than one diabetes-related autoantibody, a stark contrast to the roughly 90 percent seen within months of diagnosis in Western cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-redefining-the-diabetes-diagnosis"&gt;Redefining the diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the immune system destroying insulin-making cells, this new subtype looks like something else altogether – an insulin-deficient illness that has not yet revealed its trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sits outside type 2 diabetes, which is tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-diabetes-rate-has-doubled-reaching-over-800-million/"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t match malnutrition-related diabetes either. Clinicians had their suspicions; now the data back them up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new research findings confirm our long-standing suspicion. We have always wondered why many young people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes manage to survive without insulin, at least for some time, which would be unusual in typical type 1 diabetes,” said Dr Jean-Claude Katte of the &lt;a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-types-of-diabetes"&gt;Types of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YODA team compared African participants with more than 3,000 children and adolescents from the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.searchfordiabetes.org/dspHome.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth&lt;/a&gt; study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel pattern emerged in a small group of Black American children and was absent in White participants. That split hints at a mix of ancestral roots and environmental factors. It also rules out simple lab error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sample was tested with assays calibrated for African populations, and the same pattern appeared across three countries with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/carrots-may-help-manage-diabetes-by-improving-gut-health/"&gt;different diets&lt;/a&gt;, infections, and climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are a wake-up call. They challenge our assumptions about type 1 diabetes and show that the disease may present differently in African children and adolescents,” said Professor Moffat Nyirenda, who directs the &lt;a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-uganda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MRC/UVRI–LSHTM&lt;/a&gt; Uganda Research Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urgently need to deepen our investigations into the biological and environmental factors driving this form of diabetes and ensure our diagnostic and treatment approaches are fit for purpose in African settings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katte added, “Our next step is to investigate possible causes – ranging from infections and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-this-amount-of-water-per-day-helps-control-blood-sugar-levels-in-people-with-diabetes/"&gt;nutritional factors&lt;/a&gt; to environmental toxins. If we can find the cause, we may be able to prevent new cases and find new treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Eugene Sobngwi of Cameroon’s &lt;a href="https://www.minsante.cm/site/?q=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ministry of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; put it bluntly, saying, “We must invest in context-specific research. If we don’t, we risk misdiagnosing and mistreating millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-globally"&gt;What this means globally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly nine million people worldwide live with type 1 diabetes. If two out of every three young patients in parts of Africa actually have a different disease, the global numbers – and the research priorities that follow – need a hard look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mislabeling matters. Classic type 1 patients need lifelong insulin from day one; those with the new subtype may respond to therapies that protect or boost their still-working beta cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching that difference could spare families the cost and risk of unnecessary high-dose insulin while steering researchers toward fresh &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forgotten-organ-spleen-bioreactor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-therapy-forever/"&gt;prevention strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diagnosing-diabetes-type"&gt;Diagnosing diabetes type&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study leaves open questions. Autoantibodies can fade, so testing closer to the time of diagnosis could capture more detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, teasing apart infections, dietary patterns, and possible toxins will take careful fieldwork and, just as importantly, local funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the path is clear: broaden the research lens, update diagnostic manuals, and train healthcare teams to spot red flags – such as a young patient who stays stable on surprisingly little insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YODA data show that those cases are not rare outliers; they are part of a hidden majority in several African settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes textbooks will need an update, but the bigger story is about equity in science. Decades of work built on narrow datasets can miss whole chapters of human biology. Broadening the map doesn’t just help the regions being studied; it fine-tunes medicine for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 01:44:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPbF9JRHpuUmRpMHJxZl9USlRySGt5N1pFWktWSTN5bEFIZDlaaFhDUnJhZG9od2EyS0NkTjNEdUNkVDVqa2V0WFMwek1hT2oyTF9MN1NmTnVRTVVRU19nbUdMZVA4blJJdHUzZ2l3ZWVYbEQ0cS1GVWYzcFRKYkVKVzhoMUlLaTdyMi1nSmhDQ09yY2Y2NDNPYUV3ajMxWUxsenJBWEw5a3N0WEk</guid></item><item><title>美国罕见的食肉细菌呈上升趋势：病因、症状、高危人群、预防措施等-印度时报 | Rare flesh-eating bacteria on the rise in the US: Causes, symptoms, who is at risk, prevention and more - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warm temperatures of the summer are perfect breeding climates for a variety of bacteria that thrive in increasing temperatures.

This is a rare flesh-eating bacteria found in warm, brackish seawater, according to state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centres for Disease Prevention and Control, the bacteria are naturally found in higher numbers from May to October, due to the warm temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do people get infected?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The infections are mostly caused by the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked seafood, when an open wound comes into contact with the bacteria-infected coastal waters, or when someone swallows the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the deaths due to the bacteria occurred in Bay, Broward, Hillsborough and St. Johns counties. Other cases have been confirmed in Duval, Escambia, Lee, Manatee, Santa Rosa and Walton counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria pose a high risk to individuals with weak immune systems or chronic health conditions. "People who are most at risk are immunocompromised — people with cirrhosis, people on chemo, anybody who has a compromised immune system of any kind," said Dr. Edward Hirsch, an infectious disease specialist at HCA Florida University Hospital, to CBS NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27905887" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-Vibrio-Vulnificus" source="keywords"&gt;symptoms of Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

With open wounds, symptoms can be discolouration, swelling, skin breakdown and ulcers. According to Hirsch, "It progresses to making a hole in whatever part of your body got infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is Vibrio Vulnificus a flesh-eating bacteria?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria don't eat, but kill the tissue. It can not penetrate unharmed skin, but if it enters through an existing break- like a wound, it can cause necrotizing fasciitis, and the flesh around the infection site could die. Then, according to the CDC, the infected site could require a major surgery or even limb amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent Vibrio Vulnificus infections?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

			&lt;p&gt;Dogs really can be trained to smell  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="168151" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease, according to new research from the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a double blind trial, a Golden Retriever and a Labrador were able to sniff out which skin swabs came from people with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smell of the oily secretions seemed to hold secret clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dogs in this study achieved high sensitivity and specificity and showed there is an olfactory signature distinct to patients with the disease," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; animal behavioral scientist Nicola Rooney from the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sensitivity levels of 70 percent and 80 percent are well above chance, and I believe that dogs could help us to develop a quick, non-invasive, and cost-effective method to identify patients with Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-smell-is-tightly-linked-to-the-visual-parts-of-their-brain?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Dogs Might Actually 'See' Through Smells, Brain Scans Suggest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is no definitive early test for Parkinson's, which is why scientists are so interested in finding potential biomarkers of the disease on our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168154" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/peanutsniff-article.jpg" alt="Dog Parkinson's Test" class="wp-image-168154 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168154" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A dog smelling a skin swab from a person with or without &lt;span&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/span&gt; disease. &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;(Medical Detection Dogs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that Parkinson's distinctly changes a person's body odor first came to light roughly a decade ago – all because of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-can-smell-parkinson-s-and-could-be-the-key-to-an-early-detection-test"&gt;one woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years before her husband's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, Joy Milne could &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html"&gt;sense&lt;/a&gt; something was off – specifically, she could &lt;i&gt;smell&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milne, a Scottish nurse, is known as a 'super-smeller', and in 2016, she became famous among neuroscientists for her extraordinary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00396-8"&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt;, Milne correctly identified each patient with Parkinson's disease based solely on the scent of their shirts. Her one misidentification &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html"&gt;turned out to be correct&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news raised an important question: If someone like Milne could smell Parkinson's years before it was diagnosed, could a dog do the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs are known to have incredible senses of smell, far more powerful than our own. Previous studies have found our pets can smell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-body-smells-when-its-stressed-and-your-dog-can-sniff-it-out"&gt;our stress&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-deployed-at-helsinki-airport-can-detect-covid-19-with-near-perfect-accuracy"&gt;coronavirus infections&lt;/a&gt;, and even our &lt;a href="https://www.roswellpark.org/cancertalk/202008/can-dogs-smell-cancer"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; – so if a distinct odor for Parkinson's does exist, then maybe a dog can sniff it out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, a few &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29180"&gt;preliminary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-024-01902-5"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; have provided evidence for that hypothesis. But some only gave limited information on how the dogs were trained and tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168156" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/bumper-article.jpg" alt="Dog Smelling Parkinson's" class="size-full wp-image-168156" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168156" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A golden retriever smelling a skin swab. &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;(Medical Detection Dogs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent trial from the UK is a collaboration between a program called Medical Detection Dogs and neuroscientists at the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One goal of the research is to figure out what the dogs are actually smelling, and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, for instance, researchers at Manchester helped &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00879"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; which odor compounds set the distinctive smell of Parkinson's apart. Their results were later confirmed by Milne, the serendipitous "super-smeller".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years on, the odor compounds were used to create a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;diagnostic 'swab test'&lt;/a&gt; for Parkinson's, currently in testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, further down the road, trained dogs could help neuroscientists identify more unique biomarkers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, though, not all canines are up to snuff. In the current trial, only 2 out of 10 dogs made it through training, and neither performed perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dog, for instance, falsely flagged a tenth of the odor swabs from healthy people as having Parkinson's. The other gave false alarms less than 2 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, the dogs could smell which person had Parkinson's at a rate well above chance, providing proof of principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely proud to say that once again, dogs can very accurately detect disease," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Claire Guest, the CEO of Medical Detection Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is currently no early test for Parkinson's disease and symptoms may start up to 20 years before they become visible and persistent leading to a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Timely diagnosis is key… "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1877718X251342485"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In some cases, they claimed that antidepressants don’t work at all and that depression goes away on its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d91b73" class="body-graf"&gt;Three of the 10 panelists were from outside the United States. Another runs a clinic to help people taper off of psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-705f71" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were really rousing concerns about safety that are not evidence-based or established and not at all balanced with concerns about the risks of untreated depression,” said Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28e326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Payne, director of the Reproductive Psychiatry Research Program at the University of Virginia, said, “I’m disappointed that the FDA brought people in from outside of the United States when there’s so many experts here in the United States who truly know this [medical] literature inside and out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecf419" class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that the claim that the panel was one-sided was “insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers who dedicate their expertise to these panels.” The spokesperson added that FDA Commissioner Martin Makary “has an interest in ensuring policies reflect the latest gold standard science and protect public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb248a" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-ssri-antidepressants-children-doctors-risks-studies-rcna192722" target="_blank"&gt;called for a probe into the risks of antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-children-dire-chronic-disease-health-report-rcna208544" target="_blank"&gt;“Make America Healthy Again” report in May&lt;/a&gt; claimed there were “potentially major long-term repercussions” associated with use of the drugs in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d89ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel discussion focused on a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which includes Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft. The medications increase levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that can improve mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9556e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists often advise women who are taking SSRIs to continue doing so during pregnancy, since the risks of untreated depression tend to outweigh the potential risks of the medication to mother and child. However, the decision is a personal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-053b05" class="body-graf"&gt;For ethical reasons, there are no randomized-control trials of SSRIs in pregnant women, meaning data on potential risks mostly comes from observational studies and drug registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b232c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some babies born to mothers taking SSRIs may develop symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability or difficulty eating or sleeping that resolve quickly — what’s known as “neonatal adaptation syndrome.” The symptoms may be caused by medication in the babies’ systems or withdrawal from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c32b66" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain studies have also found a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543237/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly elevated risk of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy, though others have found &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1656691" target="_blank"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt;. However, there’s no convincing evidence to suggest that SSRIs are linked to autism or birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89ccc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Well-controlled studies continue to not find an association,” Payne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2e139" class="body-graf"&gt;Women with histories of depression are also at an increased risk of symptoms’ recurring during pregnancy, and depression can come with its own risks — including thoughts of self-harm or low birth weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1398cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing a pregnant individual could do for herself and her baby is to get the treatment that they need,” said Dr. Nancy Byatt, a perinatal psychiatrist at UMass Chan Medical School, who wasn’t part of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2da935" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to raising concerns about side effects, several panelists questioned the efficacy of antidepressants or suggested that data favoring the use of SSRIs was manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810182" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s been said that SSRIs help people who are severely depressed. They don’t,” said David Healy, an FDA panelist and fellow at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96fb04" class="body-graf"&gt;Goldberg and other psychiatrists said that’s simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1816ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can say the moon landing was faked. Conspiracy theories abound in our world. But there is not a doubt about whether SSRIs work,” said Goldberg, a past president of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology who has previously consulted for pharmaceutical companies. He said he was invited to join the FDA panel but declined because the language of the invitation suggested it wouldn’t be a fair discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c6621" class="body-graf"&gt;Healy, the panelist, also claimed that some people “recover spontaneously” from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b538fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Another panelist, psychologist Roger McFillin — who hosts a podcast that challenges conventional mental health advice — suggested that depression wasn’t an illness but rather a product of “women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely.” He added, without evidence, that many women feel coerced into taking antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-78bd4e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists who weren’t part of the discussion broadly decried those characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0874d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“I have never, ever, ever, ever heard of a third party pushing a prescription in pregnancy,” Goldberg said. However, he said he is aware of some obstetrician-gynecologists who aren’t as familiar with SSRIs who have wrongly told pregnant patients to stop taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26af8" class="body-graf"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday that SSRIs can be lifesaving for some pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-792417" class="body-graf"&gt;“Today’s FDA panel on SSRIs and pregnancy was alarmingly unbalanced and did not adequately acknowledge the harms of untreated perinatal mood disorders in pregnancy,” it said. “On a panel of 10 experts, only one spoke to the importance of SSRIs in pregnancy as a critical tool, among others, in preventing the potentially devastating effects of anxiety and depression when left untreated during pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0dfc4f" class="body-graf"&gt;One panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, a psychiatrist and an OB-GYN at the University of Florida College of Medicine, was the most vocal advocate for using SSRIs, often pushing back against others’ assessments of the risks. Psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel praised her science-backed commentary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c96" class="body-graf"&gt;“All of us can find a study that agrees with exactly what we think,” Roussos-Ross told the panel. “But we need to look at the data very objectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032c36" class="body-graf"&gt;Several psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel said they worry that the discussion could lead to regulatory action that makes it harder to access SSRIs. For example, one panelist, Dr. Adam Urato, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, called for stronger warnings on SSRI labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-97e619" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I am just very nervous that some of the discourse around the risks of antidepressants could lead to even more barriers for people seeking care,” said Dr. Lindsay Lebin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who wasn’t part of the FDA discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 23:10:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPVjhJUnU3NGh6bEE1M2xTRUNRUmU5WjRuRG5Xc012MHNJWVFfbkxQUGFiZXluc2U4YXpkZ1ctWTl3S0JxaDViOVF3cTNGckoxMEQ5cFRXVDBIaFZvaDJ0WmNZN2l2bVZQSTBXenpGNUVxM2xEeFNEeWVncGRVU3ZvWXJnOTVDXzJJZ2M1WS1udXdIQnN3LVg4QWxtSnNMVm5hRjFJSWt3VlFDUHh0bzJLcldHY0RENldmQWx0dzZXRGN3NV930gFWQVVfeXFMUFhfcmR3NHF0dFBkdGZGMVZaTUVQYU1WVmY5TmgxODJkd3pPS1F4aDBLcHFQM2EtNFUzWVE3aUphUmNHTnZIVS1UOEJqeEExNHpJNXJ3aWc</guid></item><item><title>永久化学物质现在与3500万美国人遭受的疾病有关-每日邮报 | Forever chemicals now linked to disease suffered by 35million Americans - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOa25QMmNzY01ub1QyblBoZWxQUnd3cFlYdWhNZ01RUS04dVpvUnpvZVlJOTZJR1VZUG5RUHpzaWtoeTRZTmpJV3NscURIZ1dvNmYxVFJ3SzZFUzFVWDlfT1BvSGxaVHlmMWlTNTIydWR5ZEZId0VUYi1UTVNKSkI5VUFkZldRc0htLU1nbnMySzZNYnY3cUY4YnB5b2HSAaIBQVVfeXFMTzZoNFpLM3RSMksyblVENU9SU1ZsWkpXSklpQ0lSNk5WcjZUY3hsSVowd3RzYzdGWXowMEg0WUU4UWxucS1pOVpVTDVDYi1VMmNCb2hCQmgtNTZOYWd0MXZtblNiZTJPcGVuLVNzek5oc2w4YTZpNTYyY05GOGNIT3B2LVE4cHRFVlZMN2ROY0ZROWtRYlRsNnl6Xy1NbjhNNWpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Americans exposed to 'forever chemicals' have up to a 31 percent higher risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-cb080990-dcce-11ef-8f7d-5fa74eb7f182"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new study warns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Mount Sinai looked at the link between polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - found in everything from non-stick cookware to food packaging to tap water - and the incidence of type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-8b1482d0-6641-11f0-8a07-01233015b852"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which affects up to 35 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Past research has linked the chemicals, which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14313613/Microplastics-dementia-warning-particles-hidden-teabags-increase-risk-killer-disease.html"&gt;accumulate in the body over time and are slow to break down,&lt;/a&gt; to a range of health problems, including kidney, breast and testicular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To paint a more comprehensive picture of PFAS and diabetes risk, researchers looked at large population-level datasets to identify patterns of exposure and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on available data, the study analyzed 180 people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and compared them to 180 similar individuals without diabetes. All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used blood samples to analyze PFAS levels and found that higher levels increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by almost one third. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, each increase in range of PFAS exposure was linked to a 31 percent increase in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Vishal Midya, who was the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai, said: 'Because they don't break down easily, PFAS accumulate in the environment - and in human bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from Mount Sinai looked at the link between polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - found in everything from non-stick cookware to food packaging to tap water - and the incidence of type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study is one of the first to examine how these chemicals may disrupt the body's metabolism in ways that increase diabetes risk - particularly in diverse US populations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the researchers used data from BioMe, an electronic health record-linked biobank of more than 65,000 patients seeking primary care at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an initial analysis, 180 people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were selected with this group made up of 33 percent African Americans, 33 percent Hispanics, and 33 percent Whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients were then compared to 180 similar individuals without diabetes. All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood plasma samples collected from the individuals before they were diagnosed with diabetes or given the all-clear were used to assess PFAS levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then applied Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to the samples. This statistical method is used to analyze the effects of mixtures of chemical exposures on a health outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By using WQS, the team were able to see how PFAS levels in the blood were linked to patients developing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolic alterations, such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, are key contributors to the development of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes, often linked to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, disrupt the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively, leading to hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyperglycemia occurs when the level of sugar in your blood gets too high. Chronic or persistent hyperglycemia can lead to diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of hyperglycemia include feeling thirsty, frequent urination, tiredness and breath that smells fruity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for type 2 typically involves taking insulin several times a day, either by injection or through a pump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say the new findings underscore the importance of regulating PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author, Dr Damaskini Valvi, said: 'Findings can help us design more effective interventions for the early prevention of type 2 diabetes in the future, taking into account individuals' exposures to environmental chemicals along with other well-known genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors implicated in diabetes development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mounting research suggests that PFAS are a risk factor for several chronic diseases, such as obesity, liver disease, and diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public water systems have four years to implement solutions to reduce PFAS in their water, under orders made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beginning in 2029, the EPA will police levels of six types of PFAS in drinking water - PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpA, and PFBS - and systems with unacceptable levels, will be required to notify the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that US counties where drinking water surpassed this level - such as Nassau, Suffolk, and Rockland in New York and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e0-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, Orange, and Riverside counties in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e1-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - had a higher incidence of digestive, endocrine, respiratory, and mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increases in incidence rates ranged from slightly elevated, at two percent, to 'substantially elevated' at 33 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mount Sinai team are now calling for studies involving larger populations, expanding over the life course, in order to better understand the health impacts of PFAS across the lifespan and at vulnerable life periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Get the shot&lt;/strong&gt;: DOH encourages everyone age 6 months and older to get vaccinated during the current COVID-19 surge. DOH recommends the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine particularly for the following higher-risk populations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children age 6 months to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals age 2 years to 64 years who are immunocompromised (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval of 2 months; and may receive additional doses in discussion with their healthcare provider)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults age 65 years or older (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval 2 of months)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare workers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Stay home when sick&lt;/strong&gt;: Stay home if you’re feeling sick and return to usual activities only if fever-free for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medicines, and symptoms are improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Cover your cough&lt;/strong&gt;: Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze helps stop the spread of germs that make you and others sick. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands. Clean your hands after coughing or sneezing by washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Mask up&lt;/strong&gt;: Properly wearing a well-fitted mask when you have or are recovering from COVID-19 symptoms and are indoors with other people can help prevent spread of illness to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Get a test&lt;/strong&gt;: Take a COVID-19 test if you have symptoms and might need treatment because you are at higher risk for severe infection. Many respiratory viruses have similar symptoms, but treatments differ. Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 can prevent hospitalization and death. Treatment works best when taken as soon as possible after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/" target="_blank"&gt;View additional strategies on how to reduce COVID-19 and other respiratory disease spread, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The public is reminded to take reasonable precautions to avoid getting sick. Consult your doctor about vaccinations for yourself and your family,” DOH added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-article  subscriber-hide tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-article tnt-inline-relation-sibling tnt-inline-presentation-summary tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;article id="card-summary-5b222ac3-4d31-5266-82e0-e08eda4346cb" class="tnt-asset-type-article clearfix card summary has-image  letterbox-style-blur  tnt-section-news"&gt;

In another video, the medical doctor &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dramyshah/video/7493296635120766254?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;@dramyshah&lt;/a&gt; calls it a “game-changer” and says it can decrease disease and boost mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking “is an effective, time-efficient method of increasing cardiovascular fitness,” says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.apta.org/need-help-contact-apta/media-inquiries/apta-media-corps" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Scott Capozza, PT&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the American Physical Therapy Association who’s based in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In essence, increasing the intensity of your walking speed gives you more bang for your buck, which can improve your cardiovascular system,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Japanese Walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking involves alternating three minutes of fast walking and three minutes of slower walking for 30 minutes, four days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Japanese study of this technique, published in 2007, gave the method the “Japanese walking” moniker. It found that this workout &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/hypertension/living-with/lifestyle-changes-help-you-lower-blood-pressure/" data-component-name=""&gt;lowered blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, strengthened leg muscles, and boosted aerobic health for middle-aged and older people — compared with those who walked at steady, moderate paces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fast walking” means moving at about 70 percent of your maximum effort, whereas slow walking is 40 percent effort, says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="http://movementmanagedpt.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Lindsy Jackson, DPT, PT&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist and owner of Movement Managed in Littleton, New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can measure this using a fitness tracker or heart rate monitor, says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://ahs.uic.edu/profiles/arena-ross/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Ross Arena, PhD, PT&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and head of the physical therapy department at the University of Illinois in Chicago. But if you don’t have a fitness tracker, there are other ways to ensure you’re walking briskly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you walk fast, you should be breathing harder,” Dr. Arena says. “You shouldn’t be able to comfortably have a conversation with somebody during the fast pace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential Benefits of Japanese Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interval walking method “boosts cardiovascular fitness and burns more calories than steady-paced walking,” says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/sergiu-darabant/1597499" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Sergiu Darabant, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida. “It can improve endurance and fitness capacity in a shorter amount of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several recent studies back this up. A small study published in 2025 examining the impact of interval walking training in people over 70 found that after five months, subjects had increased leg strength and improved blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in 2023 found that interval walking improved cholesterol and physical fitness for people with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/living-with/great-exercises-for-people-with-diabetes/" data-component-name=""&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2024, individuals over 65 were randomly assigned to do interval walking or a moderate-intensity continuous walking regimen. After eight weeks, the interval walking group showed stronger endurance and flexibility, but both groups had improved body composition, emotional health, sleep quality, cognitive function, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating faster-walking intervals enables you to “stretch your system,” Arena says, so your body has to work harder, which can increase your fitness levels, boost your metabolic health, and decrease your risk for disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternating your walking pace also “keeps workouts dynamic,” Dr. Jackson says, adding that it reduces the monotony of steady walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arena notes that you’d likely get heightened benefits from other &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/high-intensity-interval-training/guide/" data-component-name=""&gt;interval workouts&lt;/a&gt;, such as those incorporating running or cycling, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Try Japanese Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is an accessible form of cardio, Dr. Darabant says. “It requires no equipment, can be done anywhere, and suits a wide range of fitness levels,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts offer these tips for trying Japanese walking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear comfortable shoes.&lt;/strong&gt; “I tell my patients I’m giving them permission to go shoe shopping when starting a walking program,” Capozza says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a time that works for you.&lt;/strong&gt; Walk in the morning if you’re a morning person or in the evening if that’s best for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a buddy.&lt;/strong&gt; Walking with someone else can help keep you accountable, Capozza suggests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm up.&lt;/strong&gt; Jackson recommends starting any interval walking routine with five minutes of slow walking to prep your muscles and joints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start slowly.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re not accustomed to physical activity, Arena suggests sticking with slower-paced walking for a while and then building up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Start with three minutes of fast walking where you’re slightly out of breath and three minutes of slow walking, Jackson says. Repeat these intervals four or five times, and walk three to five days a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your progress.&lt;/strong&gt; Use your phone or a fitness tracker to track your walking intensity and how often you do it, Darabant says. Then, gradually increase your intensity and duration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate.&lt;/strong&gt; Drink plenty of water, especially if you’re walking outside in the heat, Arena says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your body.&lt;/strong&gt; Stop walking if you feel any pain or become extra winded, and talk to your doctor before starting again, Jackson suggests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who Should (and Shouldn’t) Try Japanese Walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone striving to increase their overall fitness level can benefit from interval walking, Capozza says. Darabant adds that it’s also good for those wanting to &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/tips-weight-loss-actually-work/" data-component-name=""&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; or challenge themselves with a higher-intensity workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s especially useful for people who are short on time but want a more efficient form of exercise,” Darabant says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you have a history of heart or lung problems or difficulty balancing, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program, Capozza says. Also, avoid working out intensely (or check with a healthcare provider first) if you have an injury or recent surgery, Jackson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who don’t typically exercise should start slowly and ease into the fast-walking intervals, Arena says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line on Japanese Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is good for your health long term, and incorporating fast-paced intervals can enhance these benefits, Capozza says. Any activity where you “move more and sit less is a tremendous health benefit,” Arena adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Everyday Health</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPR0c2VnpoSDFrb2RlUTVHcGhjdGk2ZmRjbmRhbUpMZUlZdk5zaTNXTExyOXpZY3dVMGhMMU9kNzFfXzVRNlFCWDI2MWF5eTBZcTNDanZBVWd4clVJcVd5S2NfaF9faDRQVm1mc2dVSm9waUhqczFoR2FmSzRMMDdNd1pSTlRBcnQzTVpKc0dpUVdXX1Z1UXc</guid></item><item><title>常用药物是否会悄然增加您患痴呆症的风险？ - WWLTV.com | Could common medications be quietly raising your risk of Dementia? - WWLTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxOaWExV0lidmFORUg0QmNES0R2UFo1M0NOMGtMMGNWMDNMTnNSWUFDU2tkaENTUmZYZWlSbDM1QWtyREpKQmFJdHBmcU1NVEFJb2xhbFBJQ1RBeHNDcVZxbzVkd05zdWttYUNaaUVpQ3BEdUE4bW9qeF85WDFUczVjRWRPa0ZvVmRXMnN3d1EzVXhlZTBzTGhoSTFQT0pKdUMySDRzNmtNQ2M4OUtlMkpiWnJpUlBtTG1vUlhjcTlBZjBHbnhpS1lUcllBNG8zQ0d0enZyZXctNy1HU2M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;As we age, the contents of our medicine cabinet may need a rethink—some everyday drugs, including cold remedies and anxiety meds, could be affecting brain health&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Could frequent use of some cold and allergy medications, and many other common drugs, like those for anxiety, increase your risk of dementia?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore that question and why, as you age, you need to change what's in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are aware of it, but patients are most likely not. Certain over-the-counter and prescription medications could increase your risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We've known about the risk of memory, thinking disorders with these medications for decades,” said Tulane Neurologist Dr. Michele Longo, who has a special interest in memory disorders and sees patients at the UMC Healthy Brain Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medications fall into two classes:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First: Anticholinergic drugs, like some sleep aids and antihistamines like Benadryl, and prescriptions for overactive bladder, asthma, COPD, sleep aids, and motion sickness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second: benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They've been around for a long time. They are probably one of the more commonly prescribed medications,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that when you stop taking the benzos, memory issues tend to go back to normal, but strong anticholinergic drug use is consistently associated with an increased risk of dementia, even after you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons age makes a difference in the medication you take and how much of it you take is that as we get older, our systems slow down, allowing medications to stay in our bodies for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we have to reconsider, look at the medicines and say, ‘Alright, does the benefit of this medicine still outweigh the risks of that medicine?’ And that balance shifts as we age.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don't think that just because a drug is over-the-counter, it means there is no risk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that is marketed in the drug store to help with sleep. You know, I tell my patients to look for “PM.” If it says “PM,” we've got to look closely. Ask the pharmacist,” Dr. Longo recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, she says, bring a list of all the medications you take to your annual exam and let your doctor guide you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

While HIV infection rates have remained fairly stable, syphilis shows the biggest increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 5 Americans live with such an infection at any given time, with health care costs estimated in the billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And with summer, rates tend to climb, which a &lt;a href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; using CDC data by Invigor Medical attributes to increased social activity, travel and sexual behavior when the weather’s warmer. But there are other factors, including varying levels of access to health care, different levels of sexual health education, differences in screening and its utilization and persistent social and economic factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Invigor Medical reports chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, with more than 1.6 million new cases in 2023, especially prominent among young women. Gonorrhea cases nearly doubled in the decade, to roughly 595,000. Syphilis increased sixfold from 34,279 cases to more than 205,000, though that may be a little misleading. Before 2018, the CDC didn’t include late-stage or unknown stage syphilis in its counts. Even so, the report said if you exclude those cases, the count still tripled over the decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s all bad news. The good news, per the report, is the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections may be slowing. Per the report, “While syphilis infections remain at record highs, reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV have declined from their peak levels in previous years, signaling a promising shift in the trajectory of the nation’s STD burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Men-vs.-women-and-infection-rates" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Men vs. women and infection rates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The analysis found that women are about 10% more likely to be diagnosed with an STD, compared to men. Among those 13 and older, there were 902 reported infections per 100,000 women, compared to 819 per 100,000 men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The gap is most pronounced for adolescents and young adults, per the report, which said that there are biological differences that make women more susceptible, but it could also be a case of doing a better job of counting. Women are more likely to be screened and screened younger during routine reproductive health visits. Men tend to be tested if they have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="State-by-state-count" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;State by state count&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The highest counts of STDs are currently found in the South, with Louisiana and Mississippi reporting the highest rates at 1,201.6 and 1,084.5 cases per 100,000, respectively. Two other states also report STD rates above 1,000 per 100,000: Alaska (1066.6) and Georgia (1020.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1450" data-height="1200"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=662" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1324 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt; Invigor Medical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The other Southern states in the top 10 are Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arkansas, while New York and South Dakota also make that top 10 list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;New England states typically have the lowest STD rates, per the report. Vermont (241). New Hampshire (251.1) and Maine (276.6) have one-fourth the infection rate of those in the highest burden states. “New England states tend to be older and have less ethnic diversity, both of which are associated with lower STD risk,” per Invigor Medical. The region also tends to have higher median income and a lower uninsured rate, so it’s easier to get tested and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Filling out the bottom 10, Oregon ranks No. 41, Connecticut, No. 42 and Montana No. 43. Utah ranks No. 44 for states with highest rates of sexually transmitted disease, then Wyoming (No. 45), Idaho (No. 46), and West Virginia (No. 47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Utah-STD-numbers" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Utah STD numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2023, Utah had 429.6 newly reported STD cases per 100,000 residents, making it seventh-best in terms of having low STD rates. Nationally, there were 746.7 cases per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of those cases in Utah, chlamydia accounted for 11,004, for a rate of 322 per 100,000, making its chlamydia rate seventh-lowest in the U.S. The national chlamydia rate was 492.2 per 100,000 with 1,648,568 new cases total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There were 77.9 new gonorrhea cases in Utah per 100,000 residents, eighth-lowest. In all, there were 2,664 new cases. Nationally, the 601,319 cases created a rate of 179.5 cases per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was sixth-lowest for syphilis, with a rate of 24.2 cases per 100,000 residents and 828 total cases. Nationally, the numbers were 205,371 cases and a rate of 61.3 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was 12th lowest for HIV, with 153 new cases, which came out to 5.5 cases per 100,000 residents. In the U.S. overall, the 38,793 cases reported created a rate of 13.7 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report includes 354 U.S. metro areas and all 50 states.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) is confirming a case of brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of Naegleria fowleri--the scientific term for the amoeba--was identified the week of July 7th but the agency hasn't said where in the state it was found.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 started looking into these claims after reports circulated in local Facebook groups suggesting a child in the Midlands may have died from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 reached out to the Centers for Disease Control, local hospitals, several coroner's offices, and the state's environmental department, but no one could confirm a death or a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCDPH did confirm the case but said it's not required to be reported to their agency. "The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person's condition," SCDPH officials clarified in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The agency stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the amoeba are naturally occurring, there is no way to prevent them in lakes or rivers. The amoeba is only life-threatening if it goes up the nose and to the brain. It is not delay if ingested through the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says early symptoms of the amoeba infection include fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Those cases usually progress rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health has criminalized nitazenes, a class of synthetic opioids that can be even stronger than fentanyl, as overdose deaths in the state mount.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes are temporarily labeled a Class I controlled substance as of Saturday, meaning it’s illegal to possess, distribute or manufacture them in the state. The action puts Pennsylvania in line with federal policy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim label can last up to two years. In its announcement, the Department of Health said it’s taking steps to place nitazenes in Class I permanently.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scheduling nitazenes, which have no acceptable medical use, as Class I substances provides law enforcement with the authority to crack down on its possession and distribution in Pennsylvania,” said Secretary of Health Debra Bogen. “Meanwhile, our focus remains on developing strategies that help connect people with substance use disorder with treatment and other resources.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes were first developed in the 1950s as an alternative to morphine, but were never approved for medical use. They were an obscure domain of pharmacological researchers until spilling into the illicit drug market in 2019.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes have continued to become more prevalent in the state’s illicit drug supply, according to the department, contributing to 45 deaths in Pennsylvania since 2023.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioids remain the leading cause of fatal overdoses in the state and across the country. In 2023, 3,757 Pennsylvanians died of an overdose involving opioids, 3,470 of which were at least partly attributed to fentanyl.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other opioids, overdose reversal medications such as Narcan should be administered in cases of nitazene overdose.

&lt;/p&gt;

Analyzing data from over 3 million individuals, researchers found that while heredity increases risk, most diagnosed individuals do not have affected relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges stigma and clarifies that mental disorders arise from complex genetic and environmental factors. The findings highlight the need for both personalized and population-level approaches to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family History Rare:&lt;/strong&gt; 89% of people with schizophrenia have no close relative with the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Causes:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental illness stems from many small genetic variations plus environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Even with family history, most people never develop a mental disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;strong&gt;t is a common belief that mental illness ‘runs in families’. And while it is true that heredity plays a role, in reality, the vast majority of cases – such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and borderline personality disorder – occur in people without any known hereditary predisposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a major new study by researchers at the Danish Center for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University, recently published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111838"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a tree." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;So while the study supports that heredity is a factor, it also makes clear that heredity is unpredictable and complex, he adds: Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is based on data from over 3 million Danes, and the researchers hope it will help alleviate concerns and reduce stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, people are most worried about what they see among close relatives. Very few go around fearing they’ll develop schizophrenia unless they have a relative with the condition. But this study clearly shows that all of us have a risk of developing mental illness,” says Professor Carsten Bøcker Pedersen, who co-authored the study with Professor Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eighty-nine percent of people diagnosed with schizophrenia have no history of the disorder among close relatives. So it’s far from something that only occurs in affected families,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern is seen with depression: 60% of individuals who experience depression have no relatives with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does my mother’s illness mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises an important question: If most mental illnesses occur in people without a relative with the same condition, how do they arise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers can’t give a precise answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mental disorders are hereditary, but they are also highly polygenic. They often result from many small genetic variations, not a single ‘disease gene.’ Additionally, environment and chance also play a role,” explains Professor Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the study is groundbreaking because it describes the absolute risk – how many out of 100 people will develop a specific mental disorder in their lifetime. This functions like an atlas, helping individuals understand, for example, the statistical implication of having a mother with a mental illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope the data can help nuance the narrative for families affected by highly heritable conditions like schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your father or sister has schizophrenia, it does not mean you will necessarily develop it. In fact, the study shows that 92% of people with a first-degree relative with schizophrenia do not develop the disorder themselves,” says Carsten Bøcker Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the study supports that heredity is a factor, it also makes clear that heredity is unpredictable and complex, he adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a parent or sibling who has had depression, your risk of developing depression is around 15% – while your risk is under 5% if you have no close relatives with the condition. But that also means you still have an 85% chance of not developing the illness, even if it appears in your immediate family. That’s an important message.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Digging into old church records&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used Danish national registries to link individuals and their mental health diagnoses across generations. The study draws on the Civil Registration System, the Multigeneration Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the National Patient Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone diagnosed in psychiatric care between January 1970 and December 2021 is included in the study – but all data is pseudonymized, meaning that researchers never accessed personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carsten Bøcker Pedersen and Esben Agerbo are key figures behind the Multigeneration Register, which they are developing in collaboration with the Danish National Archives. The register links family relationship data from the Civil Registration System with historical information from church records, tracing Danish family links back to 1920.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Multigeneration Register provides a powerful foundation for further studies on how heredity and family structure influence health in Denmark – such as the development of mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study points to the need for a dual-track approach to addressing mental illness. One track involves personalized medicine, considering individual genetics and environment. The other involves population-wide measures, such as reducing societal stressors, lowering alcohol consumption, and promoting mental well-being,” says Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both are essential if we are to prevent and understand mental illness – in both individuals with mentally ill relatives and the majority for whom the illness arises without a family history,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About the research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study is a prospective cohort study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigated disorders: substance abuse, cannabis abuse, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia and related disorders, schizoaffective psychosis, affective disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, personality disorders, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborators: Danish National Archives, University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University Hospital&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;External funding: Novo Nordisk Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afd9c6cdcac1efceda81cbc4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vibe Noordeloos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://au.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Vibe Noordeloos – Aarhus University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00196-8/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Absolute and relative risks of mental disorders in families: a Danish register-based study”&lt;/a&gt; by Carsten Bøcker Pedersen et al. &lt;em&gt;LancetPsychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute and relative risks of mental disorders in families: a Danish register-based study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative risk estimates of familial aggregation of many types of mental disorders are available, but absolute risk estimates of familial aggregation of mental disorders remain sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of individuals who develop a mental disorder in the absence of the same disorder in a relative (non-familial cases) has not been examined. We aimed to create comprehensive risk estimates of the familial aggregation of mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this prospective cohort study, we followed people of Danish origin between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 2021. We used Danish population-based registers to link individuals and their mental health across extended family pedigrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These registers include the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Multi Generation Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the Danish National Patient Register. Mental disorders investigated were substance use disorder, cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia and related disorders, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorders, bipolar disorder, single and recurrent depressive disorders (depression), personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated lifetime risk (risk up to age 60 years), age-specific absolute risk, and relative risk for each mental disorder and type of affected relative (eg first, second, or third-degree relatives). We calculated heritability estimates and the proportion of non-familial cases. We involved people with related lived experience in the study design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 3 048 583 individuals (1 486 132 [48·75%] females and 1 562 451 [51·25%] males) were followed up for 80 425 971 person-years. Individuals with a family member with a specific type of mental disorder had higher lifetime and relative risks of developing the same type of mental disorder. Both lifetime and relative risks were higher the closer the affected kinship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the lifetime risk of depression was 15·48% (95% CI 15·31–15·65) in individuals with affected first-degree relatives, 13·50% (13·25–13·75) in individuals with affected second-degree relatives, 7·80% (7·76–7·84) in the general population, and 4·68% (4·65–4·71) in individuals without affected first-degree and second-degree relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heritability for depression was 45·4% (95% CI 44·8–46·0) and the proportion of non-familial cases constituted 60·0% (95% CI 59·8–60·2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with family members with a mental disorder face increased risks of the same disorder. From a population perspective, most mental disorders occur in individuals without affected close relatives, thus highlighting the need for prevention strategies which target the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Translation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Danish translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:25:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE52MWQxOHpheHp6a2VRUjJlel9MdnVKcC1wcHJMU3pPZ2VvRVM3eWEtR19POExaQVhYcXo0MGxESlQ3dGlxTk1wZEZkTDdYR28yLW9uV3loeVBabkNhWGxwb2plM0l0d1FQRXJpQnAwaW4yQUE</guid></item><item><title>这位女士在了解了“肌肉跨度”后逆转了她的脂肪肝和糖尿病前期-以下是需要知道的-女性健康 | This Woman Reversed Her Fatty Liver And Prediabetes After She Learned About 'Musclespan'—Here's What To Know - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4zeDhIck9uOFlNREdxdHlxbHgyNzRDZHUxc0p5eFBGTnNaM3N2YTJfQjVfZDctalZwNFE1S19GVDFEQnV1TG5PZEp3MHRWOTYySC1xOFJMTUU3VThNOFJiVjhaZzR4RGFIM2N6Vk5zUGZKa3h5a2lhSUt5MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.0"&gt;Maria Arellano Simpson &lt;/strong&gt;has been on and off restrictive diets since she was 9 years old. “As a young adult growing up in the 2000s, cardio was the focus, and I spent hours doing it to try and get smaller,” says Arellano Simpson, now 44. She logged hours on the stair-stepper and miles on the pavement. It worked, to some degree, providing her a small calorie deficit but no additional muscle or strength. Then, when she had her daughter 12 years ago, she quickly put on 100 pounds, was diagnosed as prediabetic, developed a fatty liver, and registered a body fat percentage in the 50s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fast-forward to last year and her wake-up call, which came in the form of two sick relatives. “I felt like I owed it to my kids to have the best possible health, and I didn’t want them to have to take care of me when I get older,” she says. She began her quest to preserve both her wellness and lifespan. And that, in turn, led her straight to the concept of musclespan—though she didn’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Newly in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65243267/perimenopause-young-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65243267/perimenopause-young-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;, Arellano Simpson was researching how to stay healthy during the transition, so she was aware of the benefits of strength training and muscle in general. Then the social media algorithm started serving her content highlighting muscle and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One day, while scrolling TikTok, she came across a strong and athletic trainer from the fitness app &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65172928/peloton-jennifer-jacobs-joining-ladder/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65172928/peloton-jennifer-jacobs-joining-ladder/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ladder" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt; who was celebrating muscle and strength. “I remember thinking, &lt;em data-node-id="4.3"&gt;I want to be able to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="4.4"&gt;move and lift like that&lt;/em&gt;,” she recalls. Another post that caught her attention was from a female bodybuilder in her 80s. “She was lifting weights, running, just full of life,” Arellano Simpson says. That’s when “chasing muscle instead of thinness” became her new objective. “All the tools fell into my lap at the right time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Arellano Simpson, who runs a photography studio in Houston, focusing on muscle shifted her mentality from “I need to lose weight” to “I need to put on as much muscle as possible.” Losing 100 pounds was daunting. Gaining muscle and eating well (and enough)? “A quest worth pursuing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After nine months of focusing on muscle, she reversed her fatty liver and prediabetes. Her quality of life drastically improved too: She plays with her daughters at the park and climbs flights of stairs with ease, and her chronic back and knee pain are nearly nonexistent. “Muscle gives you freedom,” she says. “I know people need to hear about this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-musclespan-means" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What Musclespan Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You’ve probably heard the terms &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;lifespan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em data-node-id="8.3"&gt;healthspan&lt;/em&gt;. The former signifies how long you live, while the latter refers to how long you’re in good health. “But musclespan is the way in which we support strength and healthy aging,” says physician and &lt;em data-node-id="8.5"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt; advisor &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45381895/dr-gabrielle-lyon-forever-strong-book-excerpt/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45381895/dr-gabrielle-lyon-forever-strong-book-excerpt/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gabrielle Lyon, DO" data-node-id="8.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Gabrielle Lyon, DO&lt;/a&gt;, who coined the term and has spent years studying how protein and muscle impact aging, performance, and disease prevention. “It’s about living as long as you can with healthy skeletal muscle.” (Skeletal muscle is the muscle attached to bones, as opposed to cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, located around organs. The more you know!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As a perioperative medicine physician at Stanford Medicine, &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/k/sarita-khemani.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/k/sarita-khemani.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sarita Khemani, MD" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sarita Khemani, MD&lt;/a&gt;, often sees patients who are admitted to the hospital after a hip fracture or brain bleed due to a fall that may have been caused, in part, by weak muscles. Having muscle “in reserve” (meaning you built it up earlier in life) that can act as your armor helps you better handle the inevitable injury, surgery, or illness, says Dr. Khemani. That preparation becomes even more important as we age and face unexpected curveballs. “It’s not if, but when, illness strikes, because it happens to all of us,” Dr. Lyon says. “If you are prepared with both strength and mass, then you are much more likely to be able to overcome life’s challenges.” That is musclespan in a nutshell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So, no matter your fitness goals, if you’re interested in extending the healthy and vibrant years ahead, this is an approach that can benefit you. “The data supports that you’re never too old—and also never too young—to improve muscle health,” Dr. Lyon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="musclespan" title="musclespan" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;James Macari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-science-to-back-it" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;The Science to Back It &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Lyon argues that musclespan not only trumps healthspan but also dictates both healthspan and lifespan. “Muscle is  the key because it is a metabolic and endocrine organ,” she says, citing recent research that links low skeletal muscle mass to an increased risk of all-cause mortality. It’s not just an aesthetic or functional enabler; muscle health is also related to insulin sensitivity, metabolic health, and the ability to withstand illness or injury, Dr. Lyon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In fact, emerging science around myokines—hormone-like compounds released by contracting skeletal muscle fibers—shows they play a powerful role in regulating inflammation, protecting against chronic disease, and promoting longevity. “Of course, longevity is multifactorial,” Dr. Lyon notes. (Cardiovascular fitness, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body composition" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;body composition&lt;/a&gt;, and other markers also matter.) “But muscle health, strength, and mass have emerged as some of the most robust predictors of healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While it’s common for people to measure everything from their blood pressure and cholesterol to daily steps, very few measure and track their strength or muscle mass. And muscle isn’t often thought of as an organ in and of itself that deserves as much care as its higher-profile counterparts. “We focus on other organs, like the heart and brain, which are very important. But muscle is a critical organ, especially when it comes to longevity,” adds Dr. Khemani. In short, tracking musclespan the way you do other mainstream health markers is a smart move—and easier than you might think (see “How to Measure Your Musclespan” coming up). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-muscle-tells-you-more" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why Muscle Tells You More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;How is it that muscle is so protective? Those myokines may be the reason exercise decreases the risk of chronic disease, including cancer, cardiovascular illness, and neurodegeneration, according to a review in &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Endocrine Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. “These powerful messengers allow muscle to ‘talk’ to other organs, including the brain, adipose tissue, liver, and immune system, helping regulate vital processes like blood sugar control, metabolism, mood, and brain health,” Dr. Khemani explains. “Because of this, muscle is deeply connected to metabolic health, cognitive function, longevity, and disease resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If peak musclespan is at one end of the spectrum, sarcopenia—a disease characterized by a decline in muscle mass and function—is at the other. It’s often thought of as a disease of aging, but it actually affects more than 10 percent of adults in their 20s and 30s, per a recent review in &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;All of this is to say: “Maintaining muscle isn’t optional,” Dr. Khemani says. “Healthy muscle is one of the most powerful predictors of how long and how well one will live.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-apply-it-to-life" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;How to Apply It to Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A well-known truth: “The more active you are, the more you prime your body for muscle,” Dr. Lyon says. This means avoiding sedentary stretches outside of your regularly scheduled exercise programming. “One reason muscle becomes unhealthy is there’s no flux,” she explains. “It’s like a pond that becomes a swamp because nothing is moving.” In an ideal world, you’d get up and move at least every 30 minutes or so, says &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65367168/longevitylist/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65367168/longevitylist/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Heather Milton" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Heather Milton&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone’s Sports Performance Center.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Activity may prime the body for muscle, but resistance training builds it. “There’s no replacement for resistance training because [it changes the] muscle fibers,” Dr. Lyon says. As you age, this becomes especially important, since fast-twitch muscle fibers—the ones responsible for strength and explosive movement—naturally shrink. “They decrease in size and number, so you see people go from being buff to being skinny and sarcopenic,” she says. “You have to make sure you’re maintaining fast-twitch fibers through strength and power training.” She personally combines strength and power work in one session by integrating moves that require power—like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g25058598/medicine-ball-exercise/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g25058598/medicine-ball-exercise/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="medicine ball slams" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;medicine ball slams&lt;/a&gt;—into her strength workouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="24" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“Healthy muscle is one of the most powerful predictors of how long and how well one will live.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training twice a week is the recommended minimum, says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19036/deborah-kwolek" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19036/deborah-kwolek" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deborah Gomez Kwolek, MD" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Deborah Gomez Kwolek, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the founding lead of the Mass General Women’s Health and Sex and Gender Medicine Program. You can start small, using dumbbells at home, and work your way up to three or four sessions a week. Arellano Simpson is a good case study: She began with 15-minute strength training workouts on the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g21971119/best-workout-apps-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g21971119/best-workout-apps-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ladder app" data-node-id="25.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ladder app&lt;/a&gt;. Now she does two lower-body workouts and two upper-body workouts through the app every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;No matter how often you train, you want to target all major muscle groups—chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms, and core—and lift enough weight to put sufficient stress on the muscles so that they have to adapt. “Choose a weight that, by the last repetition, you could probably do only about one or two more times before failure, or before your form breaks,” Milton says. She suggests training primarily in a hypertrophy (or muscle growth) rep range, which is three to six sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of an exercise. Perhaps most important: Continually challenge yourself in new ways through progressive stimulus—increasing the intensity, volume, and/or complexity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And you can’t skip taking a protein-first approach to nutrition. Dr. Lyon recommends that women consume 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of target body weight, but no less than 100 grams per day; the older and more active you are, the more you need. Once protein needs are met, she adds, most metabolically healthy people can then divvy up the rest of their daily calories between carbs and fats as they like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Okay, you may feel as if you have a lot of homework now! But the flip side of &lt;em data-node-id="29.1"&gt;allll&lt;/em&gt; of these tasks is recovery. It’s critical to nail the right work-to-rest ratio so your muscles have enough time to recover, adapt, and become healthier, Milton says. “If you are doing higher-intensity exercise or lifting for the same muscle groups every day, your system doesn’t have a chance to repair that tissue,” she says. Strength training causes microscopic tears to the muscles, which require at least 48 hours to repair and come back stronger. That’s why sleep is imperative: “When we sleep, the hormones that create those adaptations are at their peak,” Milton says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Musclespan isn’t built in a day—but with strategic training, enough protein, and real rest, you can create a body with built-in armor. As Dr. Khemani puts it: If you want to stay active, independent, and mentally sharp, “muscle is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-measure-your-musclespan" data-node-id="31" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;How to Measure Your Musclespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="32.0"&gt;If you can do more than one of these tests, you’ll paint a holistic picture of your muscle health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="33" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0.0"&gt;Train three functional movement patterns. &lt;/strong&gt;“I believe everyone should be able to do a push-up, a pull-up, and a good bodyweight squat,” Dr. Lyon says. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65371604/push-up-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65371604/push-up-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Push-ups" data-node-id="33.0.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Push-ups&lt;/a&gt; in particular are a barometer of muscle­span over time, says Milton. She points to a study that found that men who could do 40 push-ups had a lower risk of morbidity and death than those who could do only 10. (Women would likely see similar benefits with fewer reps, though a comparable study hasn’t been done yet, Milton says.) Dr. Lyon recommends performing a self-assessment using these three moves—how many can you do with good form?—aiming for 10 push-ups, 1 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64702069/how-to-do-a-pull-up-training-plan-pdf/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64702069/how-to-do-a-pull-up-training-plan-pdf/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="unassisted pull-up" data-node-id="33.0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;unassisted pull-up&lt;/a&gt;, and 25-plus squats as a benchmark. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Test your grip strength. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to being a “fundamental metric” when it comes to muscle function and overall physical capacity, grip strength was proposed as a “new vital sign of health” in a recent review in the &lt;em data-node-id="33.1.2"&gt;Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. “Grip strength is an easy test that can be done on most populations without injury risk, and it has strong correlations to overall function and strength,” Milton says. You can find &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64555515/grip-strength-longevity/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64555515/grip-strength-longevity/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="grip strength testers" data-node-id="33.1.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;grip strength testers&lt;/a&gt;—called dynamometers—on Amazon. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.2.0"&gt;Know your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="VO2 max" data-node-id="33.2.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.0.1.1"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This metric tells you how much oxygen you use during exercise. “In the clinical world, we use aerobic capacity to measure your risk for early morbidity and mortality,” says Milton. It’s measured while you’re engaged in cardio, but muscle mass is one of the main components determining your number. “Muscle is the tissue with the mitochondria that utilize oxygen to produce ATP—which is the molecule needed for contraction,” she explains. Ensuring your VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.2"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max falls within a healthy range for your age and gender (look for charts online) can also provide insight into your overall muscle health. You can get a VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.4"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max test at a lab (give it a Google for locations near you) or use a wearable, like an Apple Watch or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40471424/oura-ring-gen-3-review/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40471424/oura-ring-gen-3-review/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oura Ring" data-node-id="33.2.6" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt;, for a general idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Have blood work done. &lt;/strong&gt;Remember how muscle helps regulate metabolism? Well, looking at the blood markers related to metabolic syndrome—like triglycerides, insulin, and glucose—can be a clue to your muscular health. “All of those are indicators of metabolic syndrome, which is [in actuality] unhealthy skeletal muscle,” Dr. Lyon says. She recommends having blood work performed quarterly to check your numbers. While most of the tests can be ordered by a primary care provider during a routine physical, insulin isn’t always included, she notes, so ask for a fasting insulin test specifically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.0"&gt;Consider a scan. &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65037382/bone-health-trend-dexa/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65037382/bone-health-trend-dexa/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DEXA scan" data-node-id="33.4.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;DEXA scan&lt;/a&gt; is a type of X-ray exam that uses a small amount of radiation to look at your bone density.

                                &lt;p&gt;More than 40% of U.S. adults are considered obese. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors and health experts say there are different types of fat. Some are more dangerous than others, so it's important to know what type you're carrying around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subcutaneous fat is the type just beneath the skin that you can pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the more dangerous kind, visceral fat, is buried deep within the abdomen. It's typically stored around your belly and can wrap itself around your organs, trigger inflammation, and contribute to several health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visceral fat has shown to increase all major chronic diseases," said Julia Zumpano, registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of that deep belly fat can help you be healthier, and experts say being active is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're sitting at a desk all day and we're only doing 30 minutes of exercise, but we're doing it every day, it's still really not enough for most people," Zumpano explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say work movement into your daily life. Trying a walking desk, taking breaks to go for a walk, doing squats at your desk, wearing a weighted vest, taking the stairs, or parking further away all can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key? A healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Belly fat can be increased by artificial and sugary foods," said Zumpano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, be sure to steer away from sweets and toward whole foods, like lean sources of protein and fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plant-based diets, Mediterranean diets, have been shown to be very helpful when it comes to reducing inflammation and visceral fat," Zumpano added.&lt;/p&gt;

On the East Bank, which covers more than 330,000 residents, levels are categorized as “medium” but fluctuating.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The East Bank, representing most of New Orleans, was previously in the “high” category on Friday, said Amanda Bidwell, scientific program manager for the netword, a sign that there may be a sustained bump in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we're starting to see a surge happen for COVID, it kind of toggles on and off between medium and high,” Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/louisiana-to-expand-covid-wastewater-test-to-100-sites-starting-with-jazz-fest/article_cf84837a-c595-11ec-88cf-1bf0f9505206.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wastewater offers a near real-time view&lt;/a&gt; of virus activity in the community. People shed viruses like COVID in stool, saliva and other waste when they brush their teeth or flush the toilet, making wastewater a reliable early warning tool before people might have symptoms or seek out care. The WastewaterSCAN data is updated with three samples weekly from each of the two New Orleans treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It provides a really good snapshot of what is happening in your community,” Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At local hospitals, the rise hasn’t translated into a noticeable spike in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a few patients in the hospital who have COVID, but nothing terribly outrageous,” said Dr. Julio Figueroa, an infectious disease specialist at LSU Health New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 appears to be following a now-familiar pattern: two bumps a year, often after travel-heavy holidays, said Figueroa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other common viruses tracked in the wastewater — including RSV, flu A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus D68, norovirus, and rotavirus — are also currently in the “low” range.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;For residents wondering how to use the data, Bidwell suggests thinking of it like a weather report. While public health agencies haven’t issued any formal alerts, individuals may choose to take extra precautions, like masking or avoiding large indoor gatherings, especially if they are vulnerable or caring for the young or elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With most viruses quiet for now, clinicians are turning their attention to the months ahead, when viruses are typically more active, said Figueroa, who noted a drop in vaccination rate for pertussis, or whooping cough, which has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/louisiana-measles-whooping-cough/article_cfdab26a-4e0b-4327-9659-d1c93352c84f.html" target="_blank"&gt;infant deaths in Louisiana this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s something that will make you lose just a bit more faith in humanity—or at least reach for some hand wipes. New research shows that even in hospitals, a substantial number of people aren’t bothering to wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Surrey in England led the study, installing sensors near hospital toilet and sink pipes to keep track of people’s handwashing. Nearly half of toilet users skipped the sink after flushing, they found. The researchers say more effective strategies are needed to remind and convince people of the importance of handwashing, particularly in high-risk environments like hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have tried to analyze how rigorous people are about handwashing in hospitals and other settings, but they’ve been limited. Some have relied on asking people to self-report their hygiene habits, for instance, which &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136445"&gt;might incentivize&lt;/a&gt; more than a few to fudge the truth. The researchers decided to take a different approach. They connected sensors to toilet and sink pipes that could objectively and non-intrusively detect if and when they were being used. The sensors work by measuring the temperature in the pipes and nearby air; when either cold or hot water passes through the pipes, the temperature sharply changes relative to its surroundings, indicating use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers teamed up with the Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark to conduct their study (aptly named the “FLUSH. WASH. PROTECT.” study). For 19 weeks, they tracked people’s handwashing behaviors at two public restrooms in the hospital, ultimately recording more than 2,600 flushes. Nearly 44% of the time after flushing, people steered clear of handwashing. At times, non-adherence was even worse, with over 60% of people not handwashing during certain weeks. Non-handwashing was also more common at the start and end of the day and during typical meal times. The team &lt;a href="https://osf.io/befvt"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its findings last week on the Open Source Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“People may assume handwashing is second nature by now—especially in hospitals and post-covid-19—but our data paints a different picture,” said lead author Pablo Pereira-Doel, co-leader of the Human Insight Lab at the University of Surrey’s Business School, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091556"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low rates of handwashing can, of course, make it easier for doctors, patients, and visitors to inadvertently spread dangerous infections to already vulnerable people, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;drug-resistant superbugs.&lt;/a&gt; Some studies have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483670/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that certain interventions, like clear signs, can modestly boost handwashing at hospitals, at least temporarily. But given the results here, it’s likely we’ll need to do a lot more to consistently improve people’s hand hygiene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings are worrying but not surprising. Even simple behaviors like handwashing can lapse without reinforcement. In hospitals, lapses like these can have serious consequences—for patients and for the wider healthcare system. It’s time we moved beyond posters and hand gel stations to more effective behavioral strategies,” said study author Carrie Newlands, Lead for Clinical Skills at the University of Surrey’s School of Medicine, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I wouldn’t blame you (or myself) for avoiding the standard handshake more often. And just in case anyone needs it, here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html"&gt;proper technique&lt;/a&gt; for handwashing, courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking just slightly faster helps older people stay active for longer, and stave off frailty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking just 14 steps per minute more than their usual pace led to “meaningful” improvements in physical well-being for seniors who were frail or at risk of becoming frail, according to new findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team explained that frailty is a medically defined condition in older people that increases vulnerability to everyday stresses, leading to a higher risk of falls, hospitalization, and loss of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning signs of frailty include 1) unintentional weight loss, 2) moving slowly, 3) feeling weak, 4) persistent tiredness and 5) low levels of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of these signs have a direct link to how active someone is, scientists say walking is a particularly effective way for older people to improve their overall health and quality of life, and maintain their independence longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the question had remained until now: how fast do they need to walk to see real benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the “talk test” has been used to guide walking intensity where people are encouraged to walk at a pace that makes it difficult to sing but still allows for comfortable conversation. But this method is subjective and difficult to apply consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine, found that cadence—the number of steps per minute—may be the key, and the researchers developed a smartphone app designed to accurately measure walking pace, making it easier to integrate the beneficial practice into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALK FOR YOUR BACK&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Millions Who Suffer Back Pain Can Ease Symptoms Simply by Walking More–For ‘Huge Benefits’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/millions-who-suffer-back-pain-can-ease-symptoms-simply-by-walking-more-for-huge-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Millions Who Suffer Back Pain Can Ease Symptoms Simply by Walking More–For ‘Huge Benefits’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anesthesiologist Dr. Daniel Rubin became interested in walking cadence during his clinical experience evaluating older patients preparing for surgery, because they have a higher risk of complications associated with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, surgical teams have relied on physical function questionnaires to risk-stratify patients, but I thought there must be a way to develop more objective metrics,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/health-and-wellness-articles/walking-slightly-faster-could-help-older-adults-stay-fit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a media release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rubin and his colleagues studied older adults classified as either frail or pre-frail. The participants with an average age of 69 were enrolled in structured walking programs within their retirement communities, guided and assessed by clinical research staff. Cadence was measured by a device fitted to their thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was encouraged to walk “as fast as safely possible” while another group walked at their usual comfortable pace. The results,&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; published in the journal PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, showed “clear” benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shoot for 100 steps per minute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who increased their cadence to around 100 steps per minute—14 steps per minute above their usual pace—experienced “substantial” improvements in their functional capacity (demonstrated by their ability to walk longer distances in a standardized test).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRAORDINARY&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="2 Years of Exercise Reversed 20 Years of Aging in the Heart, Says Longest-Ever Randomized Trial on Exercise" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/2-years-of-exercise-reversed-20-years-of-aging-in-the-heart-longest-ever-randomized-trial-on-exercise-showed/" rel="bookmark"&gt;2 Years of Exercise Reversed 20 Years of Aging in the Heart, Says Longest-Ever Randomized Trial on Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People who haven’t experienced frailty can’t imagine how big a difference it makes to be able to not get tired going to the grocery store or not need to sit down while they’re out,” Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on those findings, Rubin’s team created a smartphone app, called Walk Test, which they designed specifically for measuring walking cadence accurately because they didn’t necessarily trust the built-in trackers in smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app, which is not yet available publicly, uses a novel open-source method to analyze the data measured by the phone. Validation testing showed the app counts steps-per-minute with “exceptional” accuracy, closely matching specialized, research-grade accelerometers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LUCKY OR SMART?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="94-Year-old Has No Health Issues–Thanks to Zumba Classes 3 Times a Week" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/94-year-old-has-no-health-issues-thanks-to-zumba-classes-3-times-a-week/" rel="bookmark"&gt;94-Year-old Has No Health Issues–Thanks to Zumba Classes 3 Times a Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right now, people can easily maintain the beneficial cadence of 100 steps per minute by using a metronome app—or simply&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFx5Fgnrldw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; play an audio of a metronome at 100 beats per minute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even casual walking had positive effects on our study participants, but for those who are able, increasing their walking pace judiciously can yield even greater results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Photographs have been circulating online for years that supposedly depict where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet. In the photographs, there is a clearly visible line between the two, and the water on each side of the line is a different color. This has led to online speculation that the two oceans actually don't mix at all. But is that really the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet off the southernmost tip of South America, between that continent and Antarctica. Prior to the Panama Canal, this was the passage most ships took to get from one ocean to the other since the passage to the north, through Canada, had too much hazardous ice. Islands litter this area of water, and it is here that the oceans not only meet, but also mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Much of our oceans are still a big mystery to us due to the challenges of oceanic exploration. The Atlantic Ocean cooling at a record speed, the long-term effects of glaciers melting, and even the type of sea life found in the great trenches are all mysteries to study. Despite the challenges, ocean science has been able to monitor where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet, mix, and what factors contribute to how fast they merge together.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;David Merron Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are a few factors that influence the speed at which the two oceans mix. The Pacific Ocean is less salty than the Atlantic Ocean, which prevents them from mixing smoothly. The water between the islands off South America tends to be slower, which reduces the speed of the oceans mixing. However, the waters closer to Antarctica are rougher and the waves bigger, which actually speeds up the process further south. The two oceans will also blend together on the seafloor, where the daily changes of the tides influence their speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Climate change is having an effect on the rate at which the oceans mix. Human pollution has had a detrimental impact on the waters of the planet. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such impact that is clearly visible. Although a plastic-eating fungus is naturally helping to clean it up, it's not able to do so faster than we can pollute. Climate change has resulted in melting ice in Antarctica, which alters the density of the water and thus slows the rate at which the oceans mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since the oceans actually do mix, why do we see two distinct colors where they meet? The most likely cause is the waters of two different temperatures coming together. The colder water around Antarctica meets up with the warmer water from the north, and there is a visible contrast when they come together. The saltier water of the Atlantic Ocean may also be a contributory factor.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These days, if people online don't believe a photo is real, they assume it is created by AI. Given the increasingly realistic nature of AI images, it can be hard to tell what is real and what isn't — especially with new technology that will use AI to turn memories into photos. However, even before AI was everywhere, photos posted online could still be confusing and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A photo taken in 2007 that circulated around for years appeared to depict a permanent line in the water where two oceans met but never mixed. The photo — factchecked &lt;a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/two-oceans-meet/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; by Snopes — was reportedly posted by University of California-Santa Cruz professor of ocean sciences, Ken Bruland, during his research in the Gulf of Alaska. It caused a great deal of speculation online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What was seen was actually water with heavy sediment from glacial rivers meeting up with the ocean. This caused a difference in color and slowed down the waters blending together. It was not a permanent line, and the waters did eventually mix. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A case that first appeared in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18948313/"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt; several years ago has recently resurfaced in &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14896629/Baby-girl-grows-micropenis-laying-fathers-chest.html"&gt;the media&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting an unexpected risk of hormone therapies: a baby girl in Sweden developed unusually large genitals after lying on her father's bare chest, accidentally exposed to his testosterone gel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident is a reminder that hormone treatments, while safe when used correctly, can pose risks to others if proper precautions aren't followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is a powerful sex hormone that plays a crucial role in male development. In the early months of life, babies undergo rapid development, making their bodies, and hormones, extremely sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/testosterone-supplements-can-be-dangerous-heres-why-some-take-the-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Testosterone Supplements Can Be Dangerous. Here's Why Some Take The Risk.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of testosterone absorbed through the skin can affect a baby's development, particularly with repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During "mini-puberty" – a short surge in hormone levels occurring a few months after birth – boys experience rising testosterone levels that help complete reproductive system development and prime it for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32599600/"&gt;adulthood&lt;/a&gt;. This process also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/791540/"&gt;influences brain development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166303" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/mother_stroking_baby_header-642x260.jpg" alt="newborn being stroked" class="wp-image-166303 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/mother_stroking_baby_header-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/mother_stroking_baby_header-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/mother_stroking_baby_header-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/mother_stroking_baby_header.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166303" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Infants are particularly vulnerable to hormone-altering treatments. (hobo_018/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In girls, oestrogen rises slightly during this period, but testosterone remains very low. When a girl is exposed to external testosterone, such as from hormone gel, it can cause unexpected changes, including enlarged clitoris or fusion of the labia. This is precisely what occurred in the Swedish case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone gels are commonly prescribed to treat men with low testosterone deficiency. The gel is typically &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605020.html"&gt;applied once daily&lt;/a&gt; to clean, dry skin on the shoulders, upper arms or stomach. These alcohol-based gels help the hormone absorb into the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the gel dries within minutes, residue can remain on the skin for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22185431/"&gt;an hour or two after application&lt;/a&gt;. If someone touches the treated area too soon, or rests directly on it, they can inadvertently absorb some of the hormone. This risk is particularly significant for babies and children, whose thinner, more absorbent skin and developing bodies make them more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone gels are also increasingly used &lt;a href="https://www.hey.nhs.uk/patient-leaflet/unlicensed-off-label-medicines/"&gt;off-label&lt;/a&gt; in women to treat menopause symptoms (such as low libido, low mood and fatigue) and at around one-tenth of the dose given to men. This lower dose is achieved by applying a smaller amount of the same male product — this time to the lower abdomen, buttocks or inner thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means there's much less hormone overall, but incidental exposure from women is also possible, for example, when holding a child soon after application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some perspective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While stories like this understandably cause concern, it's crucial to understand the actual risk level. In the UK, around &lt;a href="https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/news/nhs-testosterone-prescribing-in-women-rises-ten-fold-in-seven-years"&gt;50,000 to 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are prescribed testosterone on the NHS, with gel formulations popular due to their ease of application. If accidental exposure were common, we would see far more cases than the small number reported in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6422752/"&gt;medical journals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605020.html"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; accompanying these gels are clear: apply only to specified areas, wash hands immediately, cover the skin once dry and avoid close skin contact for several hours. When these guidelines are followed, transfer is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12030915/"&gt;very unlikely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Swedish child, when the father stopped resting the baby on his bare chest, the genital changes reversed over time. This pattern holds true for other reported cases – if exposure stops early, many effects can fade naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in more severe or prolonged cases, children may &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.es/en-revista-endocrinologia-diabetes-nutricion-english-ed--413-articulo-potential-consequences-in-children-testosterone-S2530018017300768"&gt;need medical treatment&lt;/a&gt;. This could include hormonal tests, continued monitoring, anti-hormone treatment, or even surgery if physical changes don't resolve. Early intervention is key, making it essential to consult a doctor if there's any concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with babies, young children, or pregnant partners at home, the solution is straightforward planning. Apply the gel when you won't be in direct contact immediately afterwards, or consider alternative application methods such as injections, skin patches, or tablets (available in the US), which carry lower risks of unintentional exposure to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case serves as a valuable reminder that testosterone therapy, like all medications, comes with responsibilities. When used properly, it's an effective treatment for men with diagnosed testosterone deficiency, improving sexual function and mood, with evidence suggesting it can also support muscle mass, bone health, and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no need to fear these treatments, but if you are prescribed this medication, use it responsibly and follow the instructions carefully.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261110/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

But why should you pay attention to these specific types of foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is one of our most important organs for our overall health—so taking care of it should be a top priority, according to &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1407112998/leah-m-kaufman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1407112998" data-aps-asc-tag="vogue0d-20"&gt;Leah Kaufman&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian at NYU Langone Health. “The liver has many functions, but one of which is to eliminate wasteful substances from the body in the form of bile,” Kaufman says. “Therefore, it is important to keep your liver healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unhealthy liver can cause more health problems in the long run, so there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind when taking care of it. She recommends &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-happens-when-you-stop-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;avoiding excess alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, high fatty foods, and simple sugars as the best way to keep your liver clean and functioning well. You’ll also want to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/brain-health-exercises" target="_blank"&gt;exercise regularly&lt;/a&gt; and pick healthy foods. Here are Kaufman's picks for the best, liver-friendly foods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman recommends including a variety of foods filled with antioxidants into your diet to help cleanse the liver and decrease toxins. Studies show that foods like blueberries are not only rich with antioxidants to protect the liver from free radicals, but they also have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616313851?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814616313851?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;inhibit the growth of cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leafy Greens and Cruciferous Veggies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are another food that is rich in antioxidant properties, says Kaufman. Foods like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kale-juice" target="_blank"&gt;Kale&lt;/a&gt;, cabbage, and arugula are also great sources of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/chlorophyll-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;chlorophyll&lt;/a&gt;, which is a natural compound that is known for its &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384064/" target="_blank"&gt;detox properties&lt;/a&gt; and ability to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384064/" target="_blank"&gt;enhance liver function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous veggies, which include broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, are also known to boost liver health and protect the liver cells. A study done on mice shows that broccoli played a major role in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27672403/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing the risk of fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are another food that Kaufman said is rich in antioxidants to protect the liver from free radicals and help it cleanse out impurities from the body. Studies also show that tomatoes can help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6308920/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; of fatty liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis, scarring of the liver, or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman also recommends beets as an antioxidant-rich food you can turn to for your liver. Studies show that beet juice can protect the liver from &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free radical damage&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress. It can also &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/7/261" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the fat&lt;/a&gt; that might grow around the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From lowering cholesterol to lowering the risk of certain diseases, flaxseeds come with loads of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/flaxseeds" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Kaufman likes the food for your liver as it is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which studies show can help &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1098882324000327" target="_blank"&gt;reduce fat&lt;/a&gt; that may grow around the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon and Other Fatty Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another food rich in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/omega-3-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; is fatty fish, which include salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and tuna. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3257651/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Kaufman agrees and especially recommends salmon for the liver. Known as the ultimate anti-aging beauty food (and a favorite amongst &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/victoria-beckham-eats-this-collagen-stimulating-food-every-day#:~:text=Salmon%20is%20rich%20in%20DHA,and%20reducing%20inflammation%20and%20cholesterol." target="_blank"&gt;many celebs&lt;/a&gt;), salmon is known to be good for your brain and gut health while also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5019889/" target="_blank"&gt;lowering liver fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need more reason to justify your daily cup of joe, studies show that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/when-is-the-right-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;drinking coffee&lt;/a&gt; can help prevent many different types of liver diseases. One study done in 2016 shows that coffee can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4862107/" target="_blank"&gt;lower the risk of fatty liver disease,&lt;/a&gt; and another study done in the same year shows that drinking two cups of coffee may help &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26806124/" target="_blank"&gt;protect from permanent liver damage&lt;/a&gt; if you’re already dealing with chronic liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Olive Oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-cooking-oil" target="_blank"&gt;best cooking oils,&lt;/a&gt; and you can even &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olive-oil-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;drink it daily.&lt;/a&gt; Olive oil is a powerhouse and comes with many health benefits, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/olive-oil-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; fighting diabetes, boosting heart and gut health, strengthening bones, and reducing high blood pressure. As for the liver, studies show that olive oil can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29141573/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce inflammation and fat around the liver&lt;/a&gt; and lower elevated liver enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Garlic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of adding flavor to any dish, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-health-benefits-of-wild-garlic-detoxifying-spring-herb" target="_blank"&gt;garlic&lt;/a&gt; is packed with minerals, sulfur compounds, vitamins A and C, and fiber to promote health and prevent disease. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/the-health-benefits-of-wild-garlic-detoxifying-spring-herb" target="_blank"&gt;It is known&lt;/a&gt; to boost your immunity, protect against inflammation, may protect against certain cancers, and lower blood pressure. It also makes for one of the best liver detox foods out there. Studies show that garlic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354004/" target="_blank"&gt;can help reduce fat&lt;/a&gt; around the organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7354004/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce the risk of liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citrus Fruits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you drink orange juice daily as part of your breakfast meal or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/5-reasons-why-lemon-water-is-the-perfect-start-to-your-day" target="_blank"&gt;drink water with lemon&lt;/a&gt;, citrus fruits are great for flushing out toxins in your liver. Studies show that drinking orange juice daily can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39339791/" target="_blank"&gt;reduce your risk of fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts such as walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-nuts-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;so much nutritional value&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll find antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fiber-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin E, and healthy fats to name just a few), and they make for a great snack option or added garnish to a meal. Some &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/health-nuts-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; include maintaining or lowering cholesterol levels, reducing inflammation, and helping us maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your liver, preliminary studies show that nuts &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6731785/#sec21" target="_blank"&gt;may have a positive effect&lt;/a&gt; on reducing the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. But more studies are needed to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 18:50:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5scjh1WG0zQ0VfRUZJWHFadXBGWEcwcE84Q3J0SGY0a0pLd1F0aU83MVpScVNrV25VYnF0MS1aN3BFeW5yX3hyQl90cTl1YXlVLTZRR1hRV1BVWmM0UDc4Rl8xZ3cxTkpZVkE</guid></item><item><title>自闭症掩蔽在大脑上留下痕迹-神经科学新闻 | Autism Masking Leaves a Mark on the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9VOEF5cUxEUkF0dF9VUjNQRmh5WHUyZ3pKeUNjalNzOFBTcFdlUkVKOTU3NWtLTDJBNUQwQUMyVU50RkJsTU9lZTZXd2YyQVI5X2pGLXQ5VWVuX3NUbDhIcW1yODVYTEZaTlNaWg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Some autistic teens mask their traits to “pass” as non-autistic in social settings, but a new study reveals the hidden cognitive toll. Using EEG, researchers found these teens show faster automatic responses to faces and dampened emotional reactivity, suggesting their brains may adapt to cope with social demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first direct evidence of how masking manifests in brain activity, shedding light on its mental cost. The findings could improve identification and support for autistic teens who go unnoticed in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Differences Detected:&lt;/strong&gt; Teens who mask autism show faster facial recognition and muted emotional response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Masking:&lt;/strong&gt; 44% of autistic teens in the study passed as non-autistic in classrooms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings highlight the need to better identify and support masked autistic teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Drexel University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some autistic teens often adopt behaviors to mask their diagnosis in social settings helping them be perceived — or “pass” — as non-autistic. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers are able to observe brain functions that differ in those who “pass as non-autistic,” which could lead to a better understanding of the cognitive toll of this kind of masking, and of how these individuals could be more effectively supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brainwaves, researchers from Drexel University’s A.J. Drexel Autism Institute found that teens who pass as non-autistic in school settings showed faster automatic responses to faces and reduced emotional reactivity to subtle emotional facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111818"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg" alt="This shows heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/ASD-masking-neuroscinec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings also suggest that there may be more autistic teens who pass as non-autistic than previously thought, though larger-scale research is needed to support this. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could play a key role in ensuring autistic teens, who may not feel comfortable revealing their diagnosis, can still receive the support they need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that their brains may be wired to quickly recognize social cues while dampening emotional responses, either as a preparatory or coping mechanism,” said Matthew Lerner, PhD, associate professor, leader of the Life Course Outcomes Research Program, and director of the Social Connections and Treatment Lab in the Autism Institute and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings offer the first direct evidence of how brain activity might differ in those who pass as non-autistic, shedding light on the hidden mental effort behind social masking in autism. The findings could reshape how we understand the mental toll of masking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports,&lt;/em&gt; revealed that 44% of community-recruited autistic teens passed as non-autistic in the classroom – meaning their teachers would not have noticed or identified them as autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were in the “passed as non-autistic” group showed faster initial brain response when looking at faces and showed less emotionally reactive brain response to subtle emotions in faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lerner explained that these findings reveal, for the first time, some of the ways in which autistic teens who pass as non-autistic process social information in unique ways, which differ both from non-autistic teens and autistic teens who do not pass as non-autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also suggest that there may be more autistic teens who pass as non-autistic than previously thought, though larger-scale research is needed to support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These datasets were collected as part of a larger National Institute of Mental Health-funded study examining factors impacting social outcomes in autistic teens. Importantly, this study focused on recruiting a broad population from the community, including those who did not necessarily have an autism diagnosis in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lerner added that this allowed for inclusion of teens who meet criteria for autism by formal diagnostic processes but may not otherwise have an existing diagnosis or supports in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team explained that the “passing as non-autistic” group was identified by looking at the difference between autism features as displayed in a gold-standard diagnostic setting and those displayed in classrooms (according to teachers) and at home (according to parents).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allowed for more clearly defining what we mean by ‘passing,’ because those youth who did so both unambiguously met criteria for autism by gold-standard measures and did not show any significant hints of autism in the classroom according to their teachers,” said Lerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EEG measurements were taken during a standardized procedure where participants were shown a set of faces and asked to rate their emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their event-related potential responses — the small “blips” in the brainwave that indicate a brain’s response to stimuli (the faces) — provided information about how a person differentiates a face from a non-face object, and how a person regulates their emotional response to a stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this will spur greater inquiry into identifying autistic youth who are ‘passing as non-autistic,’ determining what cognitive efforts are involved in this, and developing improved ways to support the lives of those who are doing so,” said Lerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f1e12144a4d4d3f1b0d1a071a13511a1b0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annie Korp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annie Korp – Drexel University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-04801-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Automatic and affective processing of faces as mechanisms of passing as non-autistic in adolescence&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew D.

&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough drug is fighting brain cancer head-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, &lt;a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/02/fighting-glioblastoma-one-of-the-deadliest-forms-of-brain-cancer/"&gt;killing over 10,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; each year. There is no cure for the highly aggressive disease — many patients &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9265012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;survive just nine months&lt;/a&gt; after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and extending life via surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible and radiation therapy and chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from University College London Hospitals (UCLH) are &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/news/new-immunotherapy-brain-cancer-clinical-trial-memory-baroness-margaret-mcdonagh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recruiting glioblastoma patients&lt;/a&gt; for a trial of the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab. Sold under the brand name Yervoy, the monoclonal antibody stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oncologists are optimistic since a 43-year-old UK father shows no signs of having a tumor — he took ipilimumab before his glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy,” said Dr. Paul Mulholland, the consultant medical oncologist leading the trial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We saw with Ben, the one patient recruited to the immunotherapy study, NeAT-GLIO, that he has had clear scans since having the treatment and the tumor hasn’t returned more than two and a half years later.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Glioblastoma is widely considered the deadliest form of brain cancer, killing over 10,000 Americans each year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ben Trotman was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022 at just 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Trotman met with Mulholland, who enrolled him in a clinical trial for ipilimumab. He was the first patient in the world — and the only person in the trial — to take the drug before glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience,” said Trotman’s wife, Emily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking the drug, Ben underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years and eight months later, his scans are clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumor that was initially visible on scans,” Mulholland said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ben and Emily Trotman wed in 2023, after he began his immunotherapy treatment. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of UCLH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumor at bay,” he added, “and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, months after his diagnosis, Ben married Emily. The couple welcomed a daughter, Mabel, earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They enjoy taking her for walks along with their rescue dog, Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to live as normal a life as possible,” Emily said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are in a unique position of which there is no precedent and which comes with a great deal of uncertainty,” she continued. “We want to live each day as if it were our last, but we also want to plan for the future, which we hope to have.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to recruit 16 glioblastoma patients like Ben over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After taking ipilimumab, the trial participants will undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy and perhaps surgery depending on the extent of their disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Paul Mulholland (left) is pictured with Dame Siobhain McDonagh, who raised funds for the new clinical trial of ipilimumab. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Marie Mangan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial is being funded by Dame Siobhain McDonagh, a member of the British Parliament, whose sister died of glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma,” McDonagh said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Changing this was Margaret’s final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment will take place at the NIHR UCLH’s Clinical Research Facility at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted that this new trial, with the same immunotherapy drug I received, is going ahead and others will have the opportunity to take part,” Ben said. “It will give people newly diagnosed with glioblastoma some hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

Just days later, he celebrated his 17th birthday in the hospital and underwent multiple surgeries after developing sepsis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1466049471406647" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aneurin Bevan University Health Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aneurin Bevan University Health Board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as a "medical emergency" by the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12361-sepsis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis occurs when your immune system has a "dangerous reaction to an infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/08-09-2020-who-calls-for-global-action-on-sepsis---cause-of-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, sepsis is the cause of one in five deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mullins, his experience with sepsis started after he did something many others do on a regular basis — popped a pimple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geraint Mullins&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I enjoy popping [pimples] - and when I popped it, it was just a normal [pimple]," Mullins, now 24, told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2nx3gzr1no" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlet reported that Mullins was left with a golfball-sized abscess on his neck, which he said developed "within a few days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he started feeling "very lethargic" and "quite out of it," Mullins went to his doctor, who sent him to the hospital to undergo surgery. The surgical procedure helped drain the abscess. However, the infection was still raging a week later, which led to a secondary surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, he still has a scar on his neck. However, the outcome could have been much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was very close to potentially not being here," he told the outlet. "If I wasn't as fit, I could have been dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Mullins said that he "knew absolutely nothing" about the possibility of the deadly illness. Now, he's committed to raising awareness about what sepsis looks like and how to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that some of the warning signs of sepsis include "slurred speech," "extreme shivering," "severe breathlessness," and "mottled" skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the WHO, "only half of the people who are diagnosed with sepsis "will completely recover. Others face death or the risk of "long-term disabilities."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The world must urgently step up efforts to improve data about sepsis so all countries can detect and treat this terrible condition in time,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said in a 2020 statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC Wales News/Instagram&lt;/p&gt; Geraint Mullins&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California-based dermatologist Dr. Sandra Lee, otherwise known as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DrSandraLee" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Pimple Popper;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Pimple Popper&lt;/a&gt;, spoke to PEOPLE about the "right way to pop a pimple," though she advised against doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Be sterile, be as clean as possible. Make sure you have rubbing alcohol, clean the areas, make sure you have clean fingers or gloves are ideal, and try to use as sterile instruments as possible," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, saying, “Ideally, you want to squeeze out all that pus that’s in there because if you don’t, it can re-form or get bigger. So you really want to squeeze it just enough so you get a little tinge of blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, "Know when to pop and when to stop."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/man-popped-his-pimple-hospitalized-days-later-sepsis-11775701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:59:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB6aV9MalJHdGRjdmdrUHJLMFU4dWo4YXlGU0gzOEFMeEpPZjZLa0x0SWFjTEpNYnlTMUpaaUQ4TXNtRVMxU0JlVng5eUdPS01rblI2WXRJaS1abkp0TjMtVWU3bjBzdVpDZGFtVUV3dzlPS0tSVmlObkpWRktMQQ</guid></item><item><title>购买这些“比Hokas更好”的幻灯片，今天价格降至30美元- AOL.com | Shop these 'better than Hokas' slides while they're down to $30 today - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOTkRZWU85b215ejg3MnI1X0g1YWRMUjhVMVZFQnJzM2Q2M0h3RERFbFFaU25pYXFyTWlSSHg2QWpzNUhxemQwenRPV3dTSzBHMnlkUUNYTDB5TXFEMkhSbi1PU19zRHc2NkZnbElPQWFrV3RwM0ktLUpQc1NVNWllczhmLUtwSEJocDEyZG5ncXFhVkdzZjFOcVFyMkJnSVVvbkZXLXJOVG5aUHRrZGQ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that promise you made to yourself at the beginning of the summer about getting outside more — hiking, walking, jogging?

The foam helps take the pressure off your feet and joints and makes every step feel softer. For a little extra comfort, the insoles are textured so they give you a little massage while you walk. They're also lightweight, water-resistant and non-slip for extra peace of mind if you're wearing them around the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dogs barking?

That number includes both raccoons and feral cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabid raccoons have also been discovered in Suffolk County this year, predominantly in the Amityville area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a rare but deadly disease that can be passed to humans by the bite or scratch of an infected animal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People who have contact with a rabid animal but receive prompt treatment can avoid serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The resurgence of rabies in Nassau County, with its high population density and after nearly a decade of absence, represents a serious and evolving public health concern," Nassau County Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman said in a statement. "This declaration allows us to respond to prevent further spread and protect the health and safety of Nassau County residents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the declaration allows the county to secure resources and conduct activities to address and abate the threat, officials said. That includes spreading rabies vaccine baits in areas where infected animals have been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public is urged not to feed or touch wild animals, stray cats or dogs. In addition, it's important to make sure pets — including dogs, cats, ferrets, horses and livestock — are vaccinated against rabies, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County Department of Health asks anyone whose pet has been bitten or scratched by a wild animal to contact them and report any dead, sick or abnormally acting animal by emailing rabies@nassaucountyny.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Rubin, an anesthesiologist who led the study, and others wrote: 'We demonstrated that an increase of 14 steps per minute during the intervention sessions increased the odds of an improvement in [endurance].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Older adults can increase their [steps per minute] and [steps per minute] can serve as a surrogate measure of activity intensity during walking interventions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Average adults walk about 100 to 130 steps per minute, according to estimates, while older and frail individuals walk about 82 steps per minute on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American also walks about 5,100 steps per day, well below the recommendation of 10,000 every 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;, researchers recruited adults from 14 retirement homes near the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study defined a frail adult as an individual with weight loss, slowness, weakness, exhaustion and someone who undertook little physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants, only 35 percent were able to walk unaided with the remainder requiring a cane, walker, scooter or wheelchair at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were divided into two equal groups for walking sessions, the fast group or the relaxed group, with each led by a trained research assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adults in the exercise group saw a greater improvement than those in the relaxed group (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the first three sessions, adults were asked to walk 45 minutes at a comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the next eight sessions, participants were asked to walk 40 minutes, and start and end each session with five minutes of stair tapping — stepping and quickly tapping the toes of each foot on the edge of a step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the walking, those in the fast-walking group were also asked to increase their intensity until they reached 70 percent of their heart rate maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart rate maximum is the highest number of times the heart can beat in one minute during strenuous physical activity. It is calculated using the formula of 220 minus someone's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those in the study, their maximum heart rate would be around 147 beats per minute and 70 percent of this would be 103 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the remaining sessions, participants were asked to walk for 35 minutes but begin each session with a 10-minute warm up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But those in the exercise group were asked to incrementally increase their speed during the walking sessions to 'as fast as they safely could.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants' walking was tracked using an activPAL tracker that was strapped onto their thigh, which measured steps and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were able to stop to rest during the exercises, but this stopped the timer, which would not restart until they began to walk again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that among those in the relaxed group, their steps decreased during the study from 82 to 77 steps per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, those in the exercise group saw this rise from 86 to 100 steps per minute on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were asked to complete the six-minute walk test at the start and end of the study to measure their endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the relaxed group, participants saw a slight improvement, with the distance they walked increasing from 836 to 869 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, however, those in the exercise group saw the distance they walked increase from 843 to 1,033 feet per session - a 10 percent rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For comparison, the average American adult can walk around 2,100 feet in six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'The overall exercise dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) between the two groups only differed with respect to the intensity component as frequency and duration were kept constant between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thus, prefrail and frail older adults engaged in walking interventions can derive further improvement in their functional outcomes by increasing [steps per minute] during a fixed volume of walking exercise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although Kennedy has spent most of his public appearances campaigning for healthier foods, often with a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/dairy-industry-ice-cream-dyes-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flimsy basis&lt;/a&gt; in nutrition science, most of his policy changes have focused on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He fired all 17 members of a key vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reformulated the panel with ideological allies – including advocates directly from the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He also made Covid-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more difficult&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/pregnant-doctor-covid-19-vaccine-rfk-jr-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access&lt;/a&gt;; oversaw the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancellation of research&lt;/a&gt; into vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-effect-of-nih-funding-cuts-on-vaccine-access-and-hesitancy-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt;; spread &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; information about vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/vaccine-disinformation-trump-measles-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;equivocated&lt;/a&gt; about their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The greatest danger in elevating him to [Health and Human Services] (HHS) secretary was always that he would use his position to undermine public confidence in vaccines, which would lead to needless suffering and even death,” Bloomberg argued. “And so it has come to pass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bloomberg said that Kennedy’s actions were predictable, but that Senate Republicans either “deceived themselves” or “buckled to political pressure” to confirm Kennedy. He urged Republicans to pressure the White House to constrain Kennedy “or fire him”. If Americans die unnecessarily, Bloomberg said, Senate Republicans will pay at the ballot box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The upheaval in vaccine policy comes as the CDC is tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an historic&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak that began in an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;under-vaccinated community&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. More than 1,300 confirmed measles cases have been reported since mid-July – though experts believe the true tally is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;far higher&lt;/a&gt;. That is the worst case count &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 1992&lt;/a&gt; at only halfway through the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. A supremely effective vaccine, preventing 97% of cases with two doses, meant it was nevertheless eliminated in 2000. Experts now believe the US may be entering a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;post-herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;” era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Three people have died in the 2025 outbreak, including two healthy children and an adult. All were unvaccinated. Measles kills between one-three children per 1,000 due to respiratory or neurological complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disease can also cause permanent disability due to brain swelling, and weaken the immune system against future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the aftermath of the deaths, he did not use his position to urge parents to vaccinate their children, or warn of the dangers of failing to do so, or declare vaccines safe, or allay misplaced concerns about them,” wrote Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Instead, he did what he has been doing for decades: He presented the safety and efficacy of vaccines as an open question for individuals to decide. Not surprisingly, the outbreak continued – and has worsened,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Guardian has contacted HHS for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE9nYm9xZXcxb2prTXdQdW5La2ZIRE9LSVJ6c1Q0Z0JNbkxya0R4YTItT21KR1NtLTd4SlZMN3l2OERYeWR3dE9BQWgwZ3B2TFFsdjNWT2R4ZjJIcHU4RXdNM054SWhTdXFhaXVyNzV1eTJNVldkZHBnLTZWZk4</guid></item><item><title>5种被误解的食物以及如何识别营养神话-《华盛顿邮报》 | 5 misunderstood foods and how to spot nutrition myths - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPTXY5dkpweWw4LXhZWm1LNWgzMERnR0hEWTNQamM5UlZDSTQ4ZmZ4a0pMdXIzWi1DbVlRUTdSbnBBYXFNRFNmRnduWEM5SGpkdXRTQkpfNEQzVC1INXotUUJBZTdMeklPRDg2aHpOR3gwcHJZOFRfeTQ5Ymc2LUIxbjBBcDEtaHVrVS10OERzRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W7VDKGRZ6RGO3OEDQX4IU3PPIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BR33AMI4LNET5NWQY4UJSAYFXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to eating well, making good choices has probably never been quite as confusing as it is right now. “It’s a Wild West out there in terms of health misinformation,” says Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Anybody can claim to be a nutrition expert, but they are not always reliable sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3T5GTWYQXBD6LI54YU4I3GGGMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why it’s important to cast a critical eye on any nutritional information you see online or on social media. “Be especially wary of people who paint foods as 100 percent good or bad or who like to label certain foods as ‘toxic,’” says Jessica Clifford, an extension nutrition specialist in the food science and human nutrition department at Colorado State University. “The truth is rarely that black-and-white.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JA442Y227BFKDMYASDYITQO2YA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some nutrition topics generate more confusion than others. We asked a few experts to weigh in on five frequently misunderstood issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBM26TKW4NH6FHGNPNTT74PX3Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBM26TKW4NH6FHGNPNTT74PX3Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Raw milk&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O2WDTEULK5FYNAYB3RSRZIOWQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Raw milk — milk that hasn’t been pasteurized — has been in the news a lot lately. Those in favor of it claim that it contains more nutrients and beneficial bacteria than the pasteurized version you get at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SDUDXKBAHJBH5IR44JSN54EQFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Others see it differently. “There’s actually no credible evidence that raw milk is better for you or that pasteurization changes the nutritional quality of milk,” says Alison Kane, a registered dietitian at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “It’s simply a process of heating the milk for a short time to kill off disease-causing organisms” like &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, listeria and salmonella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKI7R6EG3NBBTLX4CYRMSB5DNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In fact, many experts say that pasteurization is one of the greatest developments in food safety. And a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/investigation-avian-influenza-h5n1-virus-dairy-cattle#ResearchStudies" target="_blank"&gt;recent study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; found that pasteurization effectively killed the bird flu virus in all of the milk samples it tested. Also important to know: The bacteria that may be present in raw milk can be dangerous to anyone. But older adults are at a high risk of illness from consuming contaminated food, including raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XV7VWC2YMBF6ZH46S4YN3CJHSA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XV7VWC2YMBF6ZH46S4YN3CJHSA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Seed oils&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5LQ7MZQOSZGJXITMSK2GWB7WIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/cooking-oils/the-new-world-of-cooking-oils-a5258864592/" target="_blank"&gt;These oils&lt;/a&gt; — which include canola, grape seed, sunflower and soy — are extracted from the seeds of plants. Critics say that their high levels of omega-6 fats raise &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/medical-conditions/ways-to-reduce-inflammation-a3226961950/" target="_blank"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body and that consuming them can lead to cancer, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HHRMTDHQANCNHA6SWQ3MV77W4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the scientific evidence doesn’t support that. “In dozens of studies looking at omega-6s and inflammation, I haven’t seen one that shows an inflammatory effect, and roughly half of studies are showing anti-inflammatory effects,” Willett says. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038908#" target="_blank"&gt;2019 review of 30 studies, published in the journal Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, found that people with the highest blood levels of a type of omega-6 fat called linoleic acid had a 7 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly because linoleic acid reduces inflammation. Plus, Willett says, we’ve known for decades that these oils also cut LDL (“bad”) &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/high-cholesterol/how-to-lower-your-cholesterol-levels-a8914186349/" target="_blank"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, and a higher intake of them has contributed significantly to the large decline in deaths from heart disease in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AOZOBEDBFJFZZP6LZIHEDRJJV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another argument that’s made against these oils is that hexane, a solvent used to extract the oil from the seeds, is toxic. “Hexane is a harmful compound,” Clifford says, “but the trace amounts that remain in the oil aren’t likely a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ALNWVZXKO5DMVCPI33H34N3H34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What may be a legitimate problem with seed oils stems from many of the products they’re found in. “Seed oils are used heavily in a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/packaged-processed-foods/is-it-okay-to-eat-some-processed-foods-a8560741913/" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;,” Clifford says. “But the negative health effects of those foods aren’t from the oils themselves.” Cooking with seed oils or using them in salad dressings isn’t putting your health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XOFZRFYZIVC6DMNEA5UB5FBHGQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XOFZRFYZIVC6DMNEA5UB5FBHGQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;‘No nitrates’ deli meats&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3RYQGYW55BCNXMIXI5TCDD65GM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The World Health Organization labeled processed meats — such as bacon, hot dogs and deli meats — carcinogenic 10 years ago. And more recent research continues to support that. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455534/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 analysis of 148 studies, published in the European Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that for every 1¾ ounces of processed meat people consume per day, the risk of colon cancer increases by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6BXLURFSZCQ7OLK3T6RAZAMOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The culprits are the nitrates used to cure, or preserve, the meats. They interact with protein in meat to form potentially cancer-causing compounds called nitrosamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JEPF35DDFFDQZI4AQQNLIATXZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Given that fact, you’d think that you would be better off buying deli and processed meat products labeled “&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/is-uncured-bacon-better-for-you-a1351961696/" target="_blank"&gt;no nitrates&lt;/a&gt;.” But this claim only means that no synthetic nitrates were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6JPK2T64YBGGXOPUAZZWX6ENQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Some products use natural forms of nitrates like celery seed, so the package can say ‘no nitrates,’” Clifford says. (These products may also be labeled “uncured.”) “But the body reacts to natural nitrates in the same way as it does to synthetic ones.” And regardless of the kind of nitrates in processed meats, you’re also probably getting a large dose of sodium when you eat them, which hikes heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CECXQB6ZARFWZBUEOWVPMJVTGI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CECXQB6ZARFWZBUEOWVPMJVTGI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Green powders&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6JZCOJQI6ZCHDIXQOK7YBAHN44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you believe the hype, those concoctions of pulverized, freeze-dried fruits, vegetables and other ingredients have the power to increase your energy, improve your digestion, boost immunity — and maybe eliminate the need to eat actual fruits and vegetables. “Even though &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/nutrition-healthy-eating/is-green-juice-good-for-you-a1150591620/" target="_blank"&gt;these powders&lt;/a&gt; appear packed with nutrients, you’re missing out on the fiber, water content and the synergistic interactions that take place when we eat nutrients in whole foods,” Kane says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F4NX7X7PAVBNLE2IWNXS5BEQHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also possible that some of the nutrients are destroyed during processing. And because they’re &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/tips-for-picking-a-multivitamin-a1038080518/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, manufacturers generally don’t have to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that they’re safe and effective. Then there’s the price: Some cost close to $100 for a month’s supply. You can buy a lot of delicious, filling produce for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6C6PCLVYORGJDIL6JBOMODPKHE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6C6PCLVYORGJDIL6JBOMODPKHE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Nightshade vegetables&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EXRYNHQ37RFUZNTKT6QA4RHYSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Eggplant, peppers, potatoes and &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/are-tomatoes-good-for-you-a6980732100/" target="_blank"&gt;tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are members of the nightshade family of plants. They’re unique because they contain small amounts of a compound called solanine. Some people think that solanine can cause or exacerbate inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/irritable-bowel-syndrome/how-to-treat-ibs-at-home-a1115445134/" target="_blank"&gt;irritable bowel disease&lt;/a&gt; and lupus and other autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DRL4GXPS75HKFI3UOTOBQUZDVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Solanine can be poisonous in large amounts, but the levels in nightshade vegetables are very low and its link to inflammation is far from conclusive. And these veggies are packed with a variety of antioxidants, like lycopene, beta-carotene and vitamin C, which &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/medical-conditions/ways-to-reduce-inflammation-a3226961950/" target="_blank"&gt;fight inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. “People should be cautious about ruling out a whole group of vegetables,” Clifford says. “These are all good sources of quite a few beneficial nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H2NCG2FEBFHCFKUB46Q6GN4ZDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That said, people can develop sensitivities to any type of food. Some with autoimmune conditions have concluded that nightshade veggies aggravate their symptoms, especially if they’ve eaten a large serving. If that’s your experience, Clifford recommends talking with your doctor or a dietitian about trying an elimination diet, where you stop eating the foods and then reintroduce them one by one to see if you have a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AIVHHNIBEVAH5MI5KXBBKVUAUI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AIVHHNIBEVAH5MI5KXBBKVUAUI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How to spot nutrition myths&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AR72ZSEMHJGELDS5B2HJWKYYAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you’re trying to separate nutrition myths from reality, keep these tips in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="74FTDRW7IVB6RGWJQM2AWUGXSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check your sources.&lt;/b&gt; If you get your information online or from social media, make sure those sources are credible.

	&lt;p&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
						
						&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom"&gt;
							





&lt;p&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaches, which are about 89% water, outshine their stone-fruit counterparts like plums and nectarines in terms of hydration, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). They also pack in similar antioxidant benefits with fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Watermelon and cantaloupe top the charts for highest water content, but peaches follow closely behind, according to the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fruits that hydrate while also providing electrolytes can help the body better replace and retain fluids than water alone, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuzzy fruits offer several electrolytes, plus many other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Peaches are rich in fiber, vitamin C and potassium,” Vandana Sheth, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All of these nutrients help support digestion, heart health, and immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;One summertime fruit doesn’t just offer juicy sweetness – it can deliver a powerful hydration boost, support brain health and supply essential vitamins and antioxidants, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A medium raw peach contains about 285 milligrams of potassium, an essential mineral and electrolyte that plays a critical role in nerve function, muscle contraction, fluid balance, heart health, and blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s more potassium than many popular electrolyte supplements and about 8.4% of the daily recommended intake for men and 11% recommended for women, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. residents consume too little potassium, which increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Peaches offer several electrolytes, plus many other nutrients, according to reports. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;alter_photo – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peaches are also heart-healthy options thanks to their antioxidant content. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They contain flavonoids, which help lower the risk of heart disease and support memory and cognition, and carotenoids, which can help fight inflammation and protect and restore skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early studies have indicated that the antioxidants can have potential anti-cancer effects, Sheth said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Peaches are rich in fiber, vitamin C and potassium,” Vandana Sheth (not pictured), a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian nutritionist, told Fox News Digital.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flavonoids and carotenoids also give peaches their distinct color.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Peaches combine two groups of pigments that you don’t often see together in other fruits and vegetables,” Mary Ann Lila, a distinguished professor in the Plants for Human Health Institute at North Carolina State University, told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Raw peaches with their skin also provide about 4% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin A and 13% of the daily vitamin C needed, plus a few grams of fiber to aid digestion and gut health, Sheth said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For those trying to limit sugar intake, pairing peaches – which contain up to 13 grams of natural sugar – with protein or healthy fats is key.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pavel Lysenko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach helps slow down sugar absorption and stabilizes blood sugar levels, added Sheth, who’s also a certified diabetes care and education specialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can add chopped peaches to your morning toast with nut butter or into your cereal or yogurt bowl, blend it into a smoothie or try grilling peaches with a sprinkle of spice,” she recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
