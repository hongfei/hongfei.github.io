The rush of heat, the pounding heart, and the urges to shout or slam a door feel almost automatic. Most of us just want lash out and vent, hoping the anger will be gone as fast as it came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, people have sworn by “getting it out,” whether by screaming into a pillow or pummeling a punching bag. Others swear by the opposite approach: pause, breathe, let it pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scientific sweep of the evidence puts these rival tactics head-to-head – and crowns a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-venting-anger-myth-loses-steam"&gt;The ‘venting anger’ myth loses steam&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second paragraph, it’s time to meet the researchers. Communication scholar &lt;a href="https://comm.osu.edu/people/bushman.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brad Bushman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; has spent years testing the notion of catharsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venting anger might sound like a good idea, but it’s actually counterproductive,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team, working with postdoctoral fellow &lt;a href="https://sophiekja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophie Kjærvik&lt;/a&gt;, combed through 154 different studies with more than 10,000 people to sort myth from reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review shows that activities lowering bodily arousal – deep breathing, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-protects-against-work-stress-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-slows-biological-aging-at-the-molecular-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, even slow, controlled yoga – consistently push anger levels down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting hardly matters; results hold for solo exercises at home, therapist-guided sessions, and app-based programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing arousal – and actually the physiological aspect of it – is really important,” Kjærvik explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-say"&gt;What the numbers say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kjærvik’s meta-analysis, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/em&gt;, found that every group studied – college students, retirees, people with intellectual disabilities, and individuals with criminal records – benefited from arousal-decreasing strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, jogging, hitting a bag, or smashing plates in a rage room showed little effect or even nudged anger upward. “To reduce anger, it is better to engage in activities that decrease arousal levels,” Bushman notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses of this size are rare in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotion research&lt;/a&gt;. By pooling so many participants, the team could spot small but steady patterns that single experiments miss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consistency across gender, age, and cultural background signals that calming the body is a universal recipe, not a fad tied to one social-media trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-beats-cardio"&gt;Calm beats cardio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would a brisk run fail where a quiet breath succeeds? Anger already revs the sympathetic nervous system – the body’s gas pedal. Adding more acceleration simply keeps the engine roaring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain physical activities that increase arousal may be good for your heart, but they’re definitely not the best way to reduce anger,” Bushman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/yoga-can-reduce-stress-and-improve-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; offers an intriguing twist. Though poses raise heart rate, the practice embeds steady breathing and focused attention, turning movement into meditation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really interesting to see that progressive muscle relaxation and relaxation in general might be as effective as approaches such as mindfulness and meditation,” Kjærvik noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And yoga, which can be more arousing than meditation and mindfulness, is still a way of calming and focusing on your breath that has a similar effect in reducing anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-body-s-alarm-system"&gt;Inside the body’s alarm system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger sparks a full-body alert: faster heartbeat, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, surging adrenaline. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system primes muscles for fight or flight, while its calmer twin – the parasympathetic branch – waits to dial everything back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techniques that lengthen exhales or tense and release muscles flip that switch sooner, cooling the system before words or fists fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists think this quick reset evolved because it lets social groups resolve conflicts without lasting harm. Lowering arousal gives the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-brain-pathways-identified-as-being-unique-to-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; – our planning center – time to weigh consequences, recall past regrets, and choose words more carefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payoff is fewer broken dishes, lower stress hormones, and relationships that bounce back instead of break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-anger-without-venting"&gt;Reducing anger without venting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps offering guided breathing now sit within arm’s reach, many of them free of charge. A simple routine – inhale for four counts, exhale for six – can drop heart rate within a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two cycles of progressive muscle relaxation ease shoulder knots that broadcast irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-minute mindfulness session on YouTube can do the same job as a longer appointment when time is tight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression,” Bushman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For situations demanding movement, try a slow walk around the block. Keep the pace easy enough to hold a steady conversation. Pair it with attention to your surroundings – the hum of cicadas, the scent of fresh-cut grass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle motion helps metabolize &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-rise-during-sleep-to-prepare-your-body-for-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; without driving arousal higher, and nature’s small details pull focus away from rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unchecked anger strains marriages, work teams, and the cardiovascular system. Over months, it can hardwire aggressive habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new review shows there’s nothing inevitable about that spiral; swapping venting for calming returns control to the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most interventions cost little or nothing, workplaces, prisons, and schools can roll them out without red tape. Even a coach’s whistle can cue athletes to pause for three slow breaths before play resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can apply the same thinking at home. Instead of sending a child to “go punch a pillow,” suggest three balloon-slow breaths, a sip of water, and a quiet corner until color fades from their cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling the strategy yourself teaches by example and keeps the living room peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling down trumps blowing up. Evidence from more than 10,000 volunteers says so, and the message holds whether you are nine or ninety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time fury rises, skip the punching bag and breathe. Your heart – and everyone within earshot – will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735824000357?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOTERJMGpmZE9UNi1ZeVJRcDFic0xZMVlkenJKVnBJWVpQMVlfMU11cXV4bzQ5V0paemprSUU4N3NBWXlUYTNKb2hva294MEpIMlBiVkcxZ0M5dEFfVTRIZ3M1QjJPcGxHOGo4bldKamJqSDgtdS1mVktPMnNsZzlNVmdjUkJTaFgxVXNqaGNRSW1KZ3Z4MTBRNVQzVzN1Zw</guid></item><item><title>健康回报： RFK Jr.的新冠疫苗建议变更可能威胁健康，获取- CNBC | Healthy Returns: RFK Jr.’s Covid vaccine recommendation change could threaten health, access - CNBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQmZoLXFzZHpzZXprSlMtNHg4cllhbmFpMFZjZmdYdTc0Rml5dTZhWWFlT1BxWU5kMjhEd1A3T0dnTTdxSnlseDg5OFpZMEVjUHB3TVF3bDk4SHBVSHJxckpEZXJKVTRhcnlndHJOM0NnUUdwbXY2Mm1WeTVmTHZ3NE9aeFBuLV9Pa2RxTWY2dWFfVVZ3SHg2U0dTalHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUG1iZWNyRnFxVUFBRllJUjB5dnphbVdZMFkzREc0TWc3Z3FieXBoRkUwX0pIMDkyX0lvd2ViWUMtNWMzX1dVNWd2cmVSaG1wamVIRC13am5vdVNacGZfSG9vUEx4VnJ1WEszVDJWMmtrZUxXVklMejFlNlhrRWExVHc4cEx2YTJXaTc1SHhUY1JLSE9PbmQ3cjg1bGtnWnhBUEJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-articleBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="SpecialReportArticle-articleBody-6-2"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-hidden"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of outrage is sweeping the scientific and medical world after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/cdc-ends-covid-vaccine-recommendation-for-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women.html"&gt;stop recommending routine Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday said the Covid shot has been removed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended immunization schedule for those groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another Covid shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children," Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;on X. He offered no scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's Kennedy's latest move to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since he took the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the federal agencies that regulate and recommend shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes a week after Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/fda-stricter-covid-vaccine-approval.html"&gt;set stricter standards&lt;/a&gt; for approving shots for healthy Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health experts say the dropped recommendation could have devastating consequences, particularly for pregnant women and their babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are considered to be at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk of severe &lt;/a&gt;complications from Covid-19 infections, according to the CDC's website. That can include&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/pregnancy-and-covid-19/art-20482639#:~:text=Pregnant%20people%20with%20severe%20COVID,high%20blood%20pressure%20or%20preeclampsia." target="_blank"&gt; preterm labor and birth&lt;/a&gt;, heart injury, blood clots and kidney damage among pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID-19 infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection," Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that "the science has not changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit," Fleischman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm#:~:text=Maternal%20vaccination%20during%20pregnancy%20has%20been%20shown,months%2C%20including%20those%20who%20are%20pregnant%20(8%2C9)" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from the virus for pregnant women and infants younger than 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischman and other experts also raised concerns about whether patients will have access to vaccines following Kennedy's decision. The CDC's recommendation is crucial because it guides insurance plans on which shots to cover at no cost to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare and Medicaid require that the recommended vaccines are free for patients. The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC's outside committee of vaccine advisors and director.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Children without insurance can get free recommended vaccines through the government-run Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are charging up to $150 per dose for their respective Covid shots before insurance, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision could make it significantly harder for millions of Americans to access vaccines they want for themselves and their families," Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/new-covid-vaccine-recommendations-threaten-access-undermine-choice-and-will-negatively-impact-health/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan added that process for Kennedy's decision breaks with the precedent of letting federal panels of experts publicly debate scientific evidence and vote on immunization practices. A group of external advisors to the CDC typically gives vaccine advice to the agency's director. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's nominee to lead the CDC, acting director Susan Monarez, still needs Senate confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall," Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the decision could "strip families of choice," preventing those who want to vaccinate from getting shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Hinge Health makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108149556" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Hinge Health Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the company's initial public offering (IPO) in New York, US, on Thursday, May 22, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear that? That was the sound of the digital health sector breathing a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital physical therapy company &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-14"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HNGE/"&gt;Hinge Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last week &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;/strong&gt;the sector's first major public exit in several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader tech IPO market has been in a drought since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. And within digital health, there's been practically no IPO activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge, founded in 2014, uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, as well as carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock opened at $39.25 on Thursday, rising 23% from its $32 IPO price. It closed up 17% at $37.56 a share, bringing its market capitalization to more than $3 billion. As of Wednesday afternoon, shares are trading at more than $41. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its IPO, Hinge had raised more than $1 billion from investors including Insight Partners, Atomico, Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts will officially kick off coverage of the stock around 30 days after its debut. But analysts at Roth shared some initial thoughts about Hinge earlier this month, before it went public. Importantly, they did not participate in the offering, make a recommendation or initiate coverage in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We watched HNGE's IPO roadshow presentation and were impressed by the AI products underpinning the platform and rate of care expansion," including beyond musculoskeletal conditions, the analysts said in a note on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge said that revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year. The company reported $117.3 million in revenue during its fourth quarter, up 44% from the same period in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roth analysts said the company's recent fundamentals are encouraging, including its accelerating revenues and billings as well as its improved operating margins. Some of the risks facing the company include the competitive digital therapy landscape, its reliance on peer-reviewed data and regulatory overhang, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hinge's debut, another digital health company is preparing to join the fray. Omada Health filed for an IPO earlier this month, though it has yet to share more details about its expected pricing or timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omada offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions like prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we did with Hinge, we'll be following this offering closely, so stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com." target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 18:56:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQmZoLXFzZHpzZXprSlMtNHg4cllhbmFpMFZjZmdYdTc0Rml5dTZhWWFlT1BxWU5kMjhEd1A3T0dnTTdxSnlseDg5OFpZMEVjUHB3TVF3bDk4SHBVSHJxckpEZXJKVTRhcnlndHJOM0NnUUdwbXY2Mm1WeTVmTHZ3NE9aeFBuLV9Pa2RxTWY2dWFfVVZ3SHg2U0dTalHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUG1iZWNyRnFxVUFBRllJUjB5dnphbVdZMFkzREc0TWc3Z3FieXBoRkUwX0pIMDkyX0lvd2ViWUMtNWMzX1dVNWd2cmVSaG1wamVIRC13am5vdVNacGZfSG9vUEx4VnJ1WEszVDJWMmtrZUxXVklMejFlNlhrRWExVHc4cEx2YTJXaTc1SHhUY1JLSE9PbmQ3cjg1bGtnWnhBUEJR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心削减后，医生担心女性将无法获得避孕研究- NPR | After CDC cuts, doctors fear women will lose access to contraception research - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOSzFhNFQxSkUtc0FYanpRQWJOR2FHcnJmMU82bUdNWEV6dTRlVkJhQ3ZReGhRZG1YR044WXE3bk80VWdoSkF2Rk9mbVRTaVF0azdxWk5fZGstN25aYlFvS2xhbDFzUmhUVWtKSHp1b01Ub3k3QW8zV3hlSlc0YlRkaVNNOU4xbUdNNU9nU08xWkRTeHZZZVUwUTZDaUZGTVg1MHQyZnRYVWlDTE1yNHZUYWwxZVM2X1hvMnJrc1ZTem91Yk1HSFg1bVRIU1ZPWHBiUFhTS2YyVjBVUlNlX1UxZWN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To most people, the eight-person team was indistinguishable from the hundreds of other scientists and researchers cut in April during the mass firings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But for many clinicians who specialize in women's health, losing the team responsible for the CDC's contraception guidelines was a devastating&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5376473/hhs-restores-funding-for-womens-health-initiative" target="_blank"&gt; blow to women's health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I just remember feeling like — of all the things — I think contraception shouldn't be controversial," says Dr. Angeline Ti, a family physician in the Atlanta, Georgia area who specializes in reproductive healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team was responsible for aggregating and disseminating best practices around contraception in a set of guidelines called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contraception/hcp/usmec/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I knew that things were gonna happen at CDC, but I thought that these guidelines were so important," says Ti. She says she uses the guidelines "pretty much every time" she sees a patient for contraceptive care. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other doctors describe feeling equally shocked. "I mean, there is no other resource that is doing this," says Dr. Andrea Braden, an obstetrician in Atlanta, Georgia. "All the OB-GYN's use it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Trump administration did not explain why the CDC team was cut. It was eliminated in April as part of the reduction of the Women's Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to HHS for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; An indispensable app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Busy doctors who are seeing many patients, says Braden, simply do not have time to comb through all the latest medical research. So, the CDC team made recommendations available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contraception/hcp/contraceptive-guidance/app.html" target="_blank"&gt;in an app &lt;/a&gt;that doctors could download and easily reference with questions about contraception, including how to navigate the topic for patients with specific conditions and diseases. It was downloaded &lt;a href="https://www.nationalfamilyplanning.org/file/2024-national-conference/DRH_Nguyen_SL_NFPRHA-2024---clean.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;440,000 times&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The app was just a game changer for us," says Braden. "That was very clearly organized, really easy to digest, and it was such a nice quick reference for us. It was a resource that we all trusted intuitively."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The current guidelines are still accessible, while the team charged with updating them no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors caution that even though the recommendations were issued relatively recently, without careful monitoring they will soon be out of date. " Medicine is not static," says Dr. Deva Sharma, a hematologist who said the guidelines are a critical part of her medical practice. "It's constantly evolving and improving."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team issued guidelines most recently in 2024. One example of a change that Braden says had a significant impact on her conversations with her patients is around recommendations for breastfeeding mothers using birth control. The new guidelines for the first time acknowledged that some contraception can jeopardize milk supply in nursing mothers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This update, she says, represented a sea change in a way of thinking about the importance of empowering patients to make their own decisions about breastfeeding. " That was such an important aspect of the update," says Braden. "It helped us guide our practice, rather than tell people what they need after they have a baby. It really put the patient at the center of the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some patients and doctors dealing with specific conditions, conversations about contraception can be matters of life or death. Sharma specializes in treating women with Sickle Cell disease — an inherited red blood cell disorder — which puts patients at a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800895#:~:text=The%20maternal%20mortality%20rate%20in,%3B%2095%25%20CI%2C%200.5%2D" target="_blank"&gt;much greater risk &lt;/a&gt;of life threatening complications in pregnancy than people without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sharma calls the termination of the CDC team "detrimental to women's health," and also recalls vividly the moment she found out when a colleague sent her a message. "I remember just feeling overwhelmed and devastated," says Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the recent guidelines, the CDC team changed recommendations for women with Sickle Cell Disease, which already puts patients at increased risk for blood clots. Doctors who treat this disease say they now rarely prescribe certain forms of contraception to their patients due to new evidence suggesting these kinds of treatments can create an even greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Braden says she is still feeling confused as to why such a valuable resource was eliminated. " I don't understand," she says "Why them? Why this sector of medicine? This is a waste."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She warns that doctors will not be able to compensate for the medical updates that this guide provides. " Medicine changes so quickly and it is very difficult to keep up with all of it," she warns. "New data comes out — new research comes out — and we find out that there's a better way to do things. Contraceptive medicine is no different from that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing treatment options are hard to measure &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many patients will not necessarily know about medical updates they do not benefit from, but Teonna Woolford is one patient who does understand the utility of the CDC's guidelines around contraception.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Born with&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/12/05/1129125408/for-patients-with-sickle-cell-disease-fertility-care-is-about-reproductive-justi" target="_blank"&gt; Sickle Cell Disease,&lt;/a&gt; Woolford started a non-profit, &lt;a href="https://sicklecellred.org/meet-our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Sickle Cell Reproductive Education Directive&lt;/a&gt;, that advocates for patients like herself. Woolford says the disease is often characterized by uncertainty and difficulty in making hard decisions around treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Having the guidelines was really like a proactive approach to addressing contraception," says Woolford. "There are a lot of knowledge and research gaps on this subject."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sickle Cell Disease disproportionately affects people of color, a group that Woolford notes has not historically enjoyed parity in reproductive justice. "The removal of the CDC team to me just &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186019422/the-black-maternal-mortality-crisis-and-why-it-remains-an-issue" target="_blank"&gt;reminds me of darker times&lt;/a&gt; in our history when people of color were oppressed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Black women in the United States have disproportionately &lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mortality-in-the-u-s-a-declining-trend-with-persistent-racial-disparities-in-the-black-population/#:~:text=Disparities%20widen%20for%20Black%20Women:%20Black%20women,than%20Hispanic%20(12.4)%20and%20Asian%20(10.7)%20women.&amp;amp;text=Black%20women%20had%2050%20deaths%20for%20every,2023%2C%20up%20slightly%20from%2049.5%20in%202022." target="_blank"&gt;high rates of maternal mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Braden sees the team's elimination as a setback to women everywhere. "It really hurts those of us in women's health — to target something like contraceptives." says Braden. "This is basic healthcare for OBGYNs and it was really defeating. I would say I felt angry and sad and confused."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She and other doctors point out that many women in the U.S. can no longer legally terminate pregnancy. They say that makes it especially important for them to be able to make an informed choice about the best ways to prevent becoming pregnant in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" Bodily autonomy has been taken away from women in various states," says Dr. Sharma, who practices in Tennessee — a state &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/04/1242721479/how-narrow-can-a-medical-exception-be-in-a-state-s-abortion-ban" target="_blank"&gt;with strict abortion laws. &lt;/a&gt;"We've slashed people's rights to make decisions," she says. "Now we're taking away evidence-based recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;

One of her last words was that she wished she had taken the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it was “concerned about and extremely disappointed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy made &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, changes to the recommended vaccine schedule are based on open public debate and the recommendation of an independent panel of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s announcement circumvented both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory panel, and neither body was advised of the forthcoming decision, sources told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;.

That agency’s advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC’s, was also bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Just a week earlier, the FDA’s head, Dr Marty Makary, published a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;similarly unprecedented&lt;/a&gt; article in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that described pregnancy and recent pregnancy as on a list of “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person’s risk of severe Covid-19”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of Tuesday, the CDC’s website continued to state that those who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19, including heightened risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care. Further, evidence shows that mothers who are vaccinated pass protective immunity to infants, without the many risks that come alongside Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Kennedy’s unilateral decision to change the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.’ Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Despite the known risks of contracting Covid-19 while pregnant, public health authorities have struggled to get pregnant people vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/pregnant-women-vaccination.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows only about 14% of pregnant people received the most recently updated Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s decision to unilaterally change the vaccine recommendation comes as some of his supporters, particularly anti-vaccine advocates, continue to call for Covid-19 vaccines to be completely removed from the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 16:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPcGRYdlhOYTNGVVlWNmh2UTQ1RFF2Nk1mMGxlaF9Yd2lMM0tTNU50Z2c3elNhNS1qNWF1cGJZZnJRR1gwaEtvU3lXNTlVX3JTSlpjZGZmVlFnREZVdHpueV9FbFpDX2NQRjdZSTQ4dDdPVnF3QlZwY3MtU09KeENNMGZIcmZlNGRMUFpn</guid></item><item><title>两种不同的宿主专用真菌物种导致蝙蝠患白鼻病-自然 | Two distinct host-specialized fungal species cause white-nose disease in bats - Nature</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1kdEN2bEtqLTJYa2dYYU05c25vM2J6MkdQbWluVzVvLXhhME1hZUZpV1J1WG5tcE1oZGo5bU5EQjRWcWFYMkdzaXl3dzN5WGFMUGNRbVd0LUFPX0dtT0xj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec5-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6"&gt;Sample and field data collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swab samples of &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; were collected from bat hibernacula.

After observing germination, typically 3–5 days after plating, plates were screened with a microscope to identify germinated single spores (identified as colonies expanding from a single germinating spore). Depending on availability, 1–3 (mean = 3.0, median = 3) and 1–5 (mean = 3.6, median = 2) single spores were typically isolated from bat and wall swabs, respectively. Isolation was performed by excising a plug with a sterile 3-mm biopsy punch and transferring it to a fresh 6-cm Petri dish. The plates were then visually monitored for 1 week to confirm that no additional spores germinated on the plug. Plates were grown at 10−15 °C until there was sufficient material to extract DNA (usually after several weeks to months). Each of these colonies is then referred to as an isolate or a culture. DNA extraction was done using a KingFisher Flex extraction robot (Thermo Scientific) with a MagMAX Plant DNA Isolation kit (Thermo Scientific). After DNA extraction, isolates were genotyped using 18 microsatellite markers and two mating-type markers in four multiplexes. The two mating-type markers were two independent primer sets used to amplify segments of the two mating types (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2) that are different in length and therefore diagnosable through fragment-length analysis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Dool, S. et al.

We used a sorbitol wash buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.35 M sorbitol, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40)) to clean the fungal material and to remove most of the culture medium from the hyphae (the wash was repeated twice with 5 min of incubation at room temperature each time). After removing the sorbitol wash buffer the second time (through centrifugation and removal of the liquid supernatant), 500 μl CTAB lysis buffer (preheated to 65 °C; 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl and 2% CTAB powder (w/v)), 30 μl proteinase K and 5 μl 1 M DTT were added for digestion and incubated overnight at 56 °C, mixing material after the first hour. After letting samples cool for 5 min at room temperature, 4 μl RNase A was added and left to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. One volume chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) was added, after which tubes were inverted 30 times and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed, keeping the supernatant. We then added a second step of proteinase K (30 μl) and RNase A (4 μl) treatment with an incubation for 30 min at 56 °C, as it was found to reduce the presence of RNA and result in better quality DNA. To remove these enzymes, we performed a second chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) extraction step by adding 1 volume, inverting 30 times and centrifuging at maximum speed for 5 min, after which the supernatant was kept. Precipitation of DNA was achieved with the use of 1/10 volume sodium acetate, 2 volumes ethanol (&amp;gt;99% purity) and centrifugation for 20 min at maximum speed. After gentle removal of the sodium acetate–ethanol mixture, the resulting pellet (containing the DNA) was washed twice with 70% ethanol.

A total of four pools were prepared per clade with each isolate appearing in one pool only. For &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1, a total of 69 isolates were used (pool sizes: 17, 17, 17 and 18 isolates), whereas for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, a total of 63 isolates was used (pool sizes: 15, 16, 16 and 16 isolates). Within clades, isolates were assigned to a pool on the basis of the DNA concentration of their extracts (that is, the 17 and 15 isolates with highest DNA concentration for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, were pooled together). The strategy of pooling samples into four pools per clade was used to validate the consistency of the results generated by each pool individually and the combined dataset (see the section ‘Genotyping’). Isolates were chosen to maximize both the geographical distance among sites and the genotypic richness within each clade. After DNA extraction (and quantification) of each isolate, DNA was combined to result in equal concentrations of isolates with a total of 500 ng DNA in a volume of 60 μl per pool.

Across all isolates, the allelic richness was high, ranging from 10 to 93 alleles per locus (mean = 37); however, we found that some alleles were fixed in the &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clade (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).

A genealogical interpretation of principal components analysis. PLoS Genet. 5, e1000686 (2009)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#ref-CR55" id="ref-link-section-d29254788e2116"&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it was important to select roughly equal sample sizes among clades to capture their differentiation in Eurasia. To achieve this, we chose 51 sites (the same number of sites in which &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 was found) from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 in a way that maximized geographical distance among them (that is, thinning sites) and used up to 20 isolates per site (again, to ensure that sampling among sites was not markedly uneven). This resulted in a dataset containing 234 and 92 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, over 51 sites each (using unique MLGs only). PCA was then performed using this &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 dataset subset and the full dataset for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2. The results revealed two clusters, which were completely differentiated. The position of the North American isolates on the PCA plot was simply determined a posteriori by projecting or predicting their coordinates using the function ‘suprow’. Considering that maximizing distance among sites may also have an influence, we confirmed these findings on the Eurasian dataset by randomly subsampling 51 sites of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 repeatedly (100,000 times, but with the number of isolates per site still capped at 20) without considering the geographical distance between chosen sites. After running these 100,000 subsampled PCAs (with &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 unchanged, the geographically thinned PCA run was added, which resulted in a total of 100,001 PCAs), the density of values observed for PC1 was consistent with the values obtained for the thinned dataset, which indicated that the signal of differentiation between &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 was strong and independent of geography or identity of the chosen sites (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used the microsatellite dataset to investigate the presence of population differentiation in each of the discovered clades. For this purpose, we investigated only Eurasian isolates (that is, excluding the 33 isolates from the United States) and treated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we used DAPC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Jombart, T., Devillard, S. &amp;amp; Balloux, F. Discriminant analysis of principal components: a new method for the analysis of genetically structured populations.

If populations from different sites are genetically differentiated, one would expect the DAPC to assign isolates to their true site of origin (that is, where they were sampled) more often than expected by chance. Here each isolate was probabilistically assigned to sites based on the observed allele frequencies (no assumptions were made, for example, about the independence of loci). Each isolate was run in an independent DAPC, which resulted in a set of 2,191 and 279 DAPCs for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively (excluding all isolates from North America and with a limited number of 20 isolates per site, see also Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;; 120 PCA axes and 100 discriminant analysis (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) axes retained in all runs). As some isolates will always be correctly assigned by chance, it was important to quantify the percentage of correct assignments by chance compared with correct assignments based on observed allele frequencies. Hence, we ran the same sets of DAPCs after randomizing the site names (independently for each run) to ascertain the frequency of correct assignments occurring by chance and the expected distances between the isolates’ site of origin and their assigned sites if assignment was no better than random (randomized DAPC). The distances between assigned sites and sites of origin are presented in the main article for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig3"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;) and in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig13"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the European sites of origin of the North American introduction, we performed two separate analyses with two different methods: multivariate analyses (DAPC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Jombart, T., Devillard, S. &amp;amp; Balloux, F.

DAPC analyses assign samples to sites already contained in the dataset, whereas the SPASIBA method can perform continuous assignment to any location (that is, coordinates) in the range defined by the user. First, we built a DAPC with all 5,162 &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 isolates from 226 sites in Europe (the site in the Ural Mountains was excluded). The aim of this DAPC was to differentiate sites; hence, sites were used as pre-defined groups. We then used the ‘predict.dapc’ function from the adegenet R package to predict site memberships of the 33 isolates from North America. Running the DAPC while limiting the number of isolates per site to 20 provided identical assignment results. Second, we used the SPASIBA model, a spatial Bayesian inference (SPASIBA) method for geospatial assignment that models the spatial frequency of alleles by a set of spatially autocorrelated random variables with Gaussian distribution. Implementation was carried out in R using the SPASIBA (v.24.6.27) and INLA (v.0.0.4) packages based on the same dataset as described above for the DAPC analysis. That is 5,162 &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 isolates from 226 sites in Europe for the reference data (‘geno.ref’) and 33 isolates from 9 sites in North America as individuals of unknown geographical origin to be assigned (‘geno.unknown’). For SPASIBA, we used the function ‘SPASIBA.inf’ with a ploidy level of 1 and a flat domain (sphere = false). To achieve a uniform spatial resolution, we configured the grid to consist of 198 pixels in longitude and 120 pixels in latitude. This setup ensured a consistent resolution across both dimensions, with each pixel representing an approximate resolution of 0.169°. To identify the most probable source of introduction inferred across the 33 North American isolates, we calculated the average assignment likelihood for each pixel across the 33 isolates (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), from which we computed the log-likelihood for representation (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visualization of EEMS (&lt;a href="https://github.com/dipetkov/eems"&gt;https://github.com/dipetkov/eems&lt;/a&gt;) was used to evaluate geographical barriers linked to patterns of gene flow&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

This method differs from PCA in that genetic differentiation is visualized as a function of migration rates rather than through genetic or genotypic distance. This method uses a population genetic model to compare expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities in relation to their geographical distances (that is, under a model of isolation-by-distance) with observed patterns across the sampled area. Specifically, a triangular grid with specific density (number of demes) is built over the area containing geo-referenced samples. For the edge of each grid, the migration parameter is estimated by Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, which means that migration is estimated in an approximated stepping-stone model between neighbouring grid cells. As sampling locations will fall into the same or neighbouring cells depending on the grid cell size, the number of demes (defining the overall density of grid cells and hence their size) influences the outcome of estimated migration rates (particularly at small geographical scales). For this reason, we calculated the EEMS for a range of deme sizes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, 100–450 demes) in independent runs of 8 million iterations each (after a burn-in of 1 million iterations), as previously recommended&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

Runs were combined in a single figure for visualization of robust migration rates using the R package reemsplot2 (v.0.1.0)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

It should be noted that estimated migration rates are most accurate closer to sampling locations and less accurate in sparsely sampled geographical areas. For this reason, in addition to clone-correction based on site identity (each genotype appears only once per site, additional occurrences are removed), the Russian isolates were excluded before calculating EEMS for both clades. This resulted in a total of 2,261 isolates used for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 107 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Markers Pd10 and Pd14 were uninformative for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 and hence removed for the EEMS (removed for the &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 dataset only), which left a dataset with 16 markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic relationships between the 5,479 isolates (or 1,866 MLGs) were reconstructed using Nei’s ‘Da’ genetic distance and Cavalli–Sforza and Edwards Chord distance ‘Dch’, as both distance measures were found to be the best performing ones to retrieve the relationships between individuals&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Takezaki, N. &amp;amp; Nei, M.

In the synteny network, genes represent nodes, and syntenic relationships between genes are represented by edges connecting the nodes. A median average clustering coefficient of 0.95 was obtained across parameter settings (min–max: 0.94–0.95%; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;), which revealed that genes tend to form a complete subgraph or cluster with their syntenic neighbours across multiple genomes. Phylogenomic profiling was then performed using the inferred syntenic clusters, which resulted in a matrix m&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;ij&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of the phylogenomic profiles, which represented the number of genes from cluster &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; that can be found in genome &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. To reveal synteny clusters that were conserved and clade-specific clusters, clusters were visualized as a heatmap with clusters clustered using Ward’s clustering on a matrix of Euclidean distance (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig2"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;).

Fastp (v.0.23.4) was used to remove bases with a phred quality value lower than 30 (‘-q 30’). Subsequently, bwa-mem2 (v.2.2.1) was used to align the Illumina reads to each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and Gd45 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2). Samtools view (v.1.16.1) was used to only keep reads with mapped (-F 0×4), properly paired (‘-f 0×2’), and high-confidence mapping quality (MAPQ values of 60: ‘-q 60’). Samtools sort and Samtools index were used to respectively sort and index the obtained BAM files. Reads were assigned using Picard (v.2.27.1) and the AddOrReplaceReadGroups tool. The SortSam tool (from Picard) was used to sort the BAM file by queryname (QNAME) before removing duplicate reads using the MarkDuplicates tool (from Picard). SortSam was subsequently used to sort the BAM file by coordinate before indexing using Samtools index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Base calling, genotyping and filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then performed base calling with ‘gatk HaplotypeCaller’ (gatk v.4.2.6.1) using the ‘-ERC BP_RESOLUTION’ mode and a ploidy of 1. Genotyping was done with ‘gatk GenotypeGVCFs’. ‘gatk SelectVariants’ was then used to extract the non-variable positions in one file and the variable positions (SNP only) in another file (insertions and deletions were discarded). Hard filtering of variable positions that did not meet the criteria ‘QUAL &amp;lt; 30.0’, ‘QUAL/DP &amp;lt; 2.0’, ‘SOR &amp;gt; 3.0’, ‘FS &amp;gt; 60.0’, ‘DP &amp;lt; 20.0’ and ‘MQ &amp;lt; 40.0’ was carried out using ‘gatk VariantFiltration’ and ‘gatk SelectVariants’. Isolate genotypes with a read depth lower than 20× at a given position were set to no-call. ‘gatk SortVcf’ was then used to merge the filtered variable and non-variable positions into a single VCF file. ‘bedtools subtract’ was subsequently used to remove masked positions from the reference genome and positions called as heterozygous when considering the isolates as diploid (see the section ‘Filtering repetitive DNA’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each contig of each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45), we then checked for the mean read depth, when mapping the 18 isolates to each reference genome, to detect unusually high read depth that would indicate the presence of repetitive sequences in the regions that nevertheless passed our filters described above. For each contig, we also checked for the average number of isolates with missing data per position to identify contigs with high levels of missing data. For Gd45, out of eight contigs that were smaller than 50 kb, two had no reads mapped, and five out of the six remaining had unusual mean read depth (lower or higher than other contigs) and/or a high average number of isolates with missing data (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, all eight contigs below 50 kb, representing in total only 0.46% of the Gd45 genome were excluded from the analyses. For Gd293, all contigs were larger than 50 kb and a single contig (contig_44) deviated from the values observed for other contigs by having a read depth about 100× higher than other contigs and having on average 13 isolates with missing data per position (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;). This contig, most likely an accessory chromosome with a high proportion of repetitive sequences, was therefore excluded from further analyses. After all filtering steps were performed (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;), the average read depths were 237 and 240 when mapping on Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. The correlation between the read depths of the 18 genomes when mapped on Gd293 and Gd45 was 0.996 (Spearman’s rank correlation &lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), which highlighted that the mapping worked equally well on either reference genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, each isolate had a genotype for over 95% of positions (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). In the end, we obtained data on 21,609,224 positions when using Gd293 as the reference (including 92,593 biallelic SNPs) and 22,041,192 positions when using Gd45 as the reference (including 95,638 biallelic SNPs). These data were stored in a single VCF file (with 18 samples) per reference genome. Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of our full procedure, we checked the number of differences obtained by mapping the Illumina reads of Gd293 to the de novo-assembled MinION genome (reference genome Gd293, see the section ‘Genome assembly’ for assembly details). We did a similar analysis for Gd45 mapped to the reference genome Gd45. For Gd293, the number of differences with the reference genome (itself) was 19 variants out of 23,660,591 positions in the final VCF file, which indicated a combined mapping, base calling and genotyping error rate of 8.030231 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;; that is 1 error every 1,245,294 bp, which corresponded to a quality score of Q60.95. For Gd45 (mapped on the reference genome Gd45), the error rate was also extremely low: 2.444712 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–6&lt;/sup&gt; (54 variants out of 22,088,490 bp), or 1 error every 409,046 bp (Q56.11). These data provide evidence that our pipeline, which incorporated several stringent filters, recovered highly reliable SNPs while preserving a large amount of data (&amp;gt;22 Mb accounting for around 60% of the reference genomes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Diversity and differentiation calculation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic diversity π was calculated per clade (11 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 7 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2) across 50 kb windows using pixy (v.1.2.7.beta1), which takes into account missing data in calculations and hence provides unbiased estimates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Korunes, K.

We used vcftools with the ‘missing-site’ function to extract missingness on a per-site basis from the VCF file containing the genotypes of the 19 (18 + 1) individuals (see the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’). Then, we calculated the number of positions with no missing data over 10 kb non-overlapping windows and only kept windows with at least 5,000 positions with no missing data across the 19 isolates. For each of the 19 isolates, we then used BEDTools getfasta to extract sequences (FASTA format) from these windows. In each window, only positions without missing data (that is, minimum 5 kb) were kept. We obtained a total of 1,275 and 1,288 genomic partitions when using the reference genomes from each clade, Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. A concatenation-based species tree with edge-linked proportional partition model with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap (-B 1000 -T AUTO) was then produced.

The Φw test calculates a pairwise similarity index between closely linked sites (situated in &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; bases) and compares observed values to values obtained after permutation of the sites. Under the null hypothesis of no recombination, the genealogical correlation between adjacent sites remains unchanged even if the order of the sites is shuffled. This is because all sites share the same evolutionary history when recombination is absent. However, when recombination occurs, the order of the sites becomes important as distant sites tend to have weaker genealogical correlations compared with adjacent sites&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 95" title="Bruen, T.

The FGT test involves counting the number of allelic combinations between any pair of SNPs on the same contig. Assuming an infinite site model, the observation of four combinations is incompatible with the absence of recombination. For example, if two SNPs have the alleles C/T and A/G, then the observation of the haplotypes CA, CG, TA and TG must be the result of a recombination event. We calculated the number of haplotypes using the script FGT.pl (&lt;a href="https://github.com/dbsloan/fgt"&gt;https://github.com/dbsloan/fgt&lt;/a&gt;). In each clade, we performed FGT on windows of 100 kb, with at least 20 kb of unmasked nucleotide positions and no missing data. We performed these analyses on the genomic data (Illumina data from individually tagged isolates) from the 18 isolates (11 from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 7 from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2; described in section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) mapped on the reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45) of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we estimated the population recombination rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 2&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the recombination rate per bp per generation and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective population size) using LDhelmet software&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 97" title="Chan, A.

These two models imply a population split at a time &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;split&lt;/sub&gt; in the past, but this event is followed by constant migration in the IM model or no migration in the SI model.

Before combining the four subpools per clade, we calculated the number of reads per subpool and subsampled them with Samtools view to have the same number of reads per isolate (1,704,260 reads) in each subpool. We then used Samtools merge to merge BAM files for the four subpools per clade, which resulted in one final pool (pool of four subpools) of 69 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 (117,589,122 reads) and one final pool (pool of four subpools) of 63 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (107,355,848 reads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Genotyping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotyping was carried out separately for each pool (one for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and one for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2), mapped on the reference genome from clade 1 and 2, which resulted in four separate analyses.

We converted the SNAPE-pooled output file to a VCF and as recommended by the program developers, we only considered positions with a posterior probability ≥0.9 as being polymorphic. In all other cases, positions were marked as monomorphic. To avoid including sequencing errors as rare alleles, we adopted two complementary strategies. First, when converting the SNAPE-pooled output to a VCF, we only included alleles that were supported by at least five reads in the pool (that is, the four subpools together). Second, we performed SNAPE-pooled analyses on each subpool (with parameters as described above) to identify alleles that were not supported by at least two reads in two subpools. These alleles were then removed from the VCF file of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Data filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To limit false-positive SNPs, we applied further filters to the VCF file to remove the following: (1) regions where repetitive DNA elements were either confirmed or suspected; (2) regions with low or high read depth (based on the Pool-seq data); and (3) regions that were identified as problematic based on read depth of individually tagged isolates (see the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’ of Illumina reads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Filtering repetitive DNA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of regions with confirmed or suspected repetitive DNA (including paralogues) that could not be confidently mapped with short-read data was carried out using three complementary approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we removed regions that were masked from the reference genome (see the section ‘Repeat annotation’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we removed regions suspected to contain hidden repetitive DNA. Although we removed regions that were masked from the reference genome (see above), a single or a set of genomes (18 in our case, see section ‘Repeat annotation’) is unlikely to harbour the full extent of the repertoire existing in repetitive DNA in a larger number of isolates such as in the Pool-seq dataset. Hidden repetitive DNA can generate spurious heterozygous genotypes that can confound the estimation of genetic differentiation between populations or species (for example, ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 106" title="Badouin, H. et al.

Hence, when using reads from an isolate that was not used to build the repeat library or the filters (for example, Pool-seq data), the unique mapping of its reads to a reference genome does not per se confirm that these reads originated from non-duplicated regions. We used levels of genetic diversity (π) as a proxy to detect hidden repetitive DNA. Repetitive DNA elements sharing a common ancestor accumulate mutations; therefore, when such loci (two or more copies) are erroneously merged together as a single locus, one expects higher levels of genetic diversity provided that everything else remains equal. We therefore removed regions with levels of π greater than 1%. This threshold was obtained by calculating the level of genetic diversity observed across 18 genomes rather than pools of individuals (see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;) for which only 0.43% and 1.43% of sites for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, showed π values greater than 1%. π was calculated per site using pixy (v.1.2.7.beta1), which takes into account missing data in calculations and hence provides unbiased estimates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Korunes, K.

Site-based calculations from pixy were then averaged in R (function ‘runner’) over 100 bp sliding windows by summing the raw counts and recomputing the differences/comparisons ratios (&lt;a href="https://pixy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html"&gt;https://pixy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html&lt;/a&gt;).

Each of the 18 isolates (as listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; (except the outgroup)) were mapped against the reference genome (as per the section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads) and analysed in diploid mode (that is, considering that the isolate is diploid). For this, we used the same pipeline as for base calling isolates (with gatk; see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) but with ploidy of 2. Sites scored as heterozygote in at least one isolate were recorded in a BED file. A total of 183,756 heterozygote sites (spread across contigs) were identified in those 18 genomes when using Gd293 as the reference and 177,785 when using Gd45 as the reference. All those heterozygote sites were removed from all 18 genomes, irrespective the isolates they originated from. Although these data alone might indicate that &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; is diploid, results from the microsatellite analysis firmly refuted this hypothesis. Indeed, we genotyped 5,479 isolates originating from single spore (that is, monosporic isolation) cultures for 18 microsatellite loci (see the section ‘Cultures and genotyping’), and out of the 98,622 genotypes (5,479 × 18), we never encountered 2 alleles per locus for any single spore isolate. Two alleles for some loci and some isolates would be expected if &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; was diploid. Furthermore, such levels of heterozygosity have already been reported when base calling haploids in diploid mode in other fungal species (for example, ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 109" title="Li, X. et al.

These regions contained in the final BED file were then excluded from the VCF file in BEDTools substract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Filtering based on read depth&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many species of fungi have accessory chromosomes, and the results from the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’ provide strong evidence that this is also the case for both of the &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades. As a result, stringent filtering based on read depth alone was not possible. We therefore only performed light filtering by setting sites with a read depth below 20× or above 600× per pool as missing data. Based on read depth and levels of missing data from individually tagged isolates (section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), we identified a few problematic contigs that were also filtered out from the Pool-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;Filtering outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filtering steps described in the previous two sections resulted in a narrowing of the 95% highest density interval (hdi95) of the read depth for both clades when mapped to the reference genome of both clades (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). When using reference genome Gd45, &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 hdi95 narrowed down from 5–529 to 234–560 whereas &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 hdi95 narrowed down from 124–470 to 217–470. When using reference genome Gd293, &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 hdi95 narrowed down from 92–512 to 236–523 whereas &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 hdi95 narrowed down from 5–511 to 227–542. Positions filtered out were mostly, although not exclusively, positions with read depth less than 200 (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), which meant that accessory chromosomes constitute a substantial part of the data filtered out.

Images were imported into R using the readImage function that extracts the intensity of each pixel of the red, green and blue channels. Pixels with red intensity above 0.7 were characteristic of cultures, whereas the background (culture medium) was below 0.7. Coordinates (that is, their position in the image) of pixels with red intensity above 0.7 were stored and used to calculate the minimum convex polygon (MCP) using the mcp function of the adehabitatHR package. The MCP was used to outline the edge of the fungal growth and to calculate the number of pixels it covered. To overcome potential issues with dark non-fungal material present on the plate (for example, droplets of water or dirt) that would be included in 100% MCPs and hence artificially increase culture size, we calculated 11 MCPs per isolate, excluding 5−15% of outliers in steps of 1 (11 values; that is, MCP 85 until 95%). We then extrapolated the number of pixels covered by the fungus (for example, for an isolate covering 180 pixels calculated with an MCP 90%: 180/90 × 100 = 200 pixels). For each MCP, pixels were finally transformed to square centimetres with the use of cross multiplication in relation to an object of known size (5.207681 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For each isolate, the average across the 11 MCPs was used, and the quality of the estimates was evaluated using the standard deviation of the estimate made for the 11 MCPs and visual inspection of the edge of the MCPs depicted on top of the original picture.

For this analysis, closely related bat species that are challenging to identify during hibernation were pooled together. Furthermore, to improve model convergence and to ensure identifiability of the model, only the most commonly infected species, that is, species from which we isolated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt; at ten or more sites were included in the model. This resulted in a dataset comprising 4,295 isolates from 231 sites in Europe, broken down as follows: &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mystacinus&lt;/i&gt; (28 isolates, 10 sites); &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;dasycneme&lt;/i&gt; (107 isolates, 11 sites); &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;daubentonii&lt;/i&gt; (111 isolates, 17 sites); &lt;i&gt;Myotis&lt;/i&gt; species complex (322 isolates, 38 sites); and &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;myotis&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;blythii&lt;/i&gt; (3,727 isolates, 187 sites). We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model using clade identity as our response variable and a logit link function. Bat species, latitude and longitude were included as population-level effects (analogous to a fixed effect in a frequentist approach), whereas samples (nested within sites) and sites were included as group effect (analogous to a random effect in a frequentist approach) with random intercept. The group-level effects were used to account for variations between sites and between samples within site. Given that both &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades were found in roughly equal numbers in &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mystacinus&lt;/i&gt; (13 and 15 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively), this bat species was used as the baseline category. To estimate the model parameters and to perform Bayesian inference, the model was fitted using 8 chains with 10,000 iterations each. To improve convergence, the ‘adapt_delta’ parameter, controlling the acceptance rate of the algorithm, was set to 0.99. The first 1,000 iterations of each chain were discarded as warm-up (burn-in) to ensure convergence. Chains were sampled using the NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler) algorithm in Stan (&lt;a href="https://mc-stan.org/"&gt;https://mc-stan.org/&lt;/a&gt;) with the brms (v. 2.20.3)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 124" title="Bürkner, P.-C. brms: an R package for Bayesian multilevel models using stan.

We retrieved sequences of these two genes from the full genomes of 18 isolates (based on Illumina read mapped on reference genome Gd293; see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) and from the filtered Pool-seq datasets of each &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clade, &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 containing 69 and 63 isolates, respectively (also mapped on Gd293; see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (Pool-seq data)’). This was done to search for fixed positions that could discriminate the &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on sequences from 150 isolates (69 and 63 from Pool-seq data; 18 from full genomes), we identified six substitutions in &lt;i&gt;TEF1&lt;/i&gt; (at positions 3155612, 3155783, 3156573, 3157304, 3157318 and 3157602 on contig 34 of Gd293) and three in &lt;i&gt;RPB2&lt;/i&gt; (at positions 523497, 525708 and 526300 on contig 34 of Gd293) that fully discriminated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades. These nine substitutions were fixed in clades. Based on the sequences from the 18 isolates mentioned above and the outgroup Gd267, both clades formed monophyletic groups when building a phylogenetic tree for each gene separately (data not shown).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these discriminating sites in &lt;i&gt;TEF1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPB2&lt;/i&gt;, we searched in published nucleotide sequences in NCBI for &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; to classify isolates to either clade &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 or &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2. Using this approach, a set of isolates from the Czech Republic (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3), Portugal (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13) and South Korea (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) could be identified as belonging to clade &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;), for example. These data combined with the data presented in the main text confirmed that &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 co-occur in Europe, but thus far, only &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 has been found in East Asia (one isolate from China, one from Mongolia, two from South Korea). This result suggests that &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 is rarer in East Asia or perhaps even absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 15:51:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1kdEN2bEtqLTJYa2dYYU05c25vM2J6MkdQbWluVzVvLXhhME1hZUZpV1J1WG5tcE1oZGo5bU5EQjRWcWFYMkdzaXl3dzN5WGFMUGNRbVd0LUFPX0dtT0xj</guid></item><item><title>皮肤和脖子上有微妙的迹象，这意味着您可能会因100米而遭受致命疾病-每日邮报 | Subtle signs on your skin and neck that mean you could have deadly condition suffered by 100m - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unexplained changes in your skin can occur for a number of reasons - whether it's from time in the sun or allergies. However, a health coach warns they could be a sign of something more sinister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jade Rivers, a wellness coach, recently revealed 'what a body looks like when it's heading toward [type 2] diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition globally and over 37million American adults suffer from this form of the chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11238421/Even-SLIM-type-2-diabetics-reverse-condition.html"&gt;either the pancreas not producing enough insulin&lt;/a&gt; or the body's cells not responding properly to insulin. This leads to high blood sugar levels and a buildup of glucose in the bloodstream, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often linked to lifestyle factors like obesity, poor diet and lack of physical activity and because it develops gradually, people may not know they have it until serious complications arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Rivers, if people are able to recognize several changes in their bodies that indicate insulin resistance - a precursor to diabetes that plagues 100million people - they may be able to make changes and reverse it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the unexpected signs you could be headed toward a type 2 diabetes diagnosis: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dark patches on the neck and underarms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Insulin resistance can lead to the build of the hormone in the body, which can cause dark spots and rashes on the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark, velvety patches on the skin, often in body folds like the neck and armpits, can be a sign of acanthosis nigricans (AN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a skin condition often associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and a possible early sign of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patches are not caused by diabetes itself, but rather by the underlying insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AN is characterized by dark, velvety patches in areas across the body like the neck, armpits, groin, and sometimes on the hands, elbows, or knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is typically a sign your body is making extra insulin. When the body is resistant to insulin, the pancreas may overproduce the hormone in order to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This excess insulin then builds up and causes the dark patches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it can cause embarrassment and some people may try to scrub or bleach the patches away, this is not effective in getting rid of the dark spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, you should change your diet to include more healthy foods and get physical activity. Losing weight can also help. This will lower the amount of excess insulin in the body and can alleviate AN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Skin tags&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Skin tags, also known as acrochordons, are small, harmless growths often found in areas where skin folds or rubs together, such as the neck, armpits and groin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also appear where skin rubs against clothing or jewelry and are caused by friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typically benign, if you begin noticing the appearance of more skin tags than is normal for you, a trip to the doctor may be in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jade Rivers, a wellness expert, who noted that dark patches on the neck and underarms and a slight hump on at the neck are all signs that your body is heading towards Type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with insulin resistance, skin tags form because insulin plays a role in regulating cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone is insulin resistant and the pancreas produces too much, it can stimulate the growth of skin cells, which in turn can lead to skin tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, insulin resistance can disrupt the balance of the hormone insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is linked to skin tag formation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;A hump or fat around your neck Neck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neck hump, sometimes called a buffalo hump, is a fat pad that forms at the base of the back of the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being insulin resistant and struggling with a build up of insulin in the body leads to weight gain, fat accumulation and a struggle to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could cause fat deposits to collect in certain areas of the body, such as the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the hormone imbalance caused by insulin resistance or full-blown diabetes contributes to abnormal fat distribution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other symptoms of insulin resistance, a hump or fat around the neck can be alleviated by diet and exercise changes, which can lead to healthy weight loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As they surveyed colonies of hibernating bats, they discovered heaps of dead animals on the floors of caves and abandoned mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The culprit was a fungus new to science. It caused white-nose disease, named for the fuzzy pale tendrils that sprouted from the nostrils of its victims. (The disease was originally known as white-nose syndrome, but was renamed in recent years.) The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or P. destructans, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/where-is-wns" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; from New York to 40 states and nine Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is the most dramatic wildlife mortality event that’s ever been documented from a pathogen,” said DeeAnn Reeder, a disease ecologist at Bucknell University. “Millions and millions and millions of animals have died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In recent years, bat experts have gained some &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/science/bats-white-nose-syndrome.html" title=""&gt;guarded optimism&lt;/a&gt;. They have found ways to protect bats from white-nose disease and to help infected animals survive. But &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09060-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday raised the possibility that North American bats could get slammed by a second wave of white-nose disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;An extensive genetic survey has found that Pseudogymnoascus destructans is actually two species native to Europe and Asia. Only one has reached North America. If the second one is introduced to the continent, it could start another devastating epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s like a reboot,” said Dr. Reeder, who was not involved in the study. “I think it’s terrifying, honestly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

              &lt;p&gt;As we enter the colder months in Australia, covid is &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; designated NB.1.8.1 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what do you need to know about this new variant?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The current covid situation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than five years since covid was initially declared a pandemic, we’re still experiencing regular waves of infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/news-data/covid-statistics/"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt; suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAIN-Aust-COVID-19-Stats-worksheet-2025.xlsx-18.pdf"&gt;ticking upwards&lt;/a&gt;. Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;among the circulating strains&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250517.pdf"&gt;generally increasing&lt;/a&gt;. Of cases sequenced &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;up to May 6&lt;/a&gt; across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia &lt;a href="https://www.health.wa.gov.au/articles/a_e/coronavirus/covid19-wastewater-surveillance"&gt;has determined NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;collected in Perth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;late April 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences—up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia—it was the dominant variant in &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md"&gt;Hong Kong and China&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where does this variant come from?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;collected in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-hybrid-covid-strain-behind-vietnams-latest-wave-not-exactly-161879"&gt;Recombinant&lt;/a&gt;” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;a suite of mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us—specifically via the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"&gt;ACE2 receptors&lt;/a&gt;, a “doorway” to our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;mutations include&lt;/a&gt; T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It’s early days for this variant, so we don’t have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested—suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains. The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;LP.8.1.1&lt;/a&gt;. This means it’s possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; compared to other variants. Reports suggest &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-in-cases-recently-symptoms-associated-with-it/photostory/121373694.cms"&gt;symptoms of NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches, and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How about the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia’s winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated covid boosters.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Even if neutralising antibody levels &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;are modestly reduced&lt;/a&gt; against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current covid vaccines should still &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;protect against severe disease&lt;/a&gt; with this variant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;targets JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another covid booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;if you’re eligible&lt;/a&gt;. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, covid can still be a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/lara-herrero-1166059"&gt;Lara Herrero&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor and Research Leader in Virology and Infectious Disease, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/griffith-university-828"&gt;Griffith University&lt;/a&gt;.

Visitors heading to Oahu’s North Shore are being asked to take mosquito precautions as health officials respond." data-app-id-name="post_above_content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii health officials have just confirmed a travel-related case of Zika virus on Oahu—the first such detection in the state since 2019. While the virus was not contracted locally, the Department of Health is urging travelers to take precautions, especially on the island’s north shore in the Waialua and Haleiwa areas, where the infected individual spent time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vector control teams are actively working to prevent any potential mosquito-borne transmission. The state has not issued any restrictions, but the fact that visitors are mentioned in this alert is a reminder that visitors play a role in preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in tropical destinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-zika-virus-matters-for-hawaii-travelers"&gt;Why Zika virus matters for Hawaii travelers.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes. Most people infected do not experience symptoms, but the virus poses serious risks during pregnancy—including birth defects and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises anyone pregnant or planning pregnancy to consult their doctor before traveling to areas where Zika has been identified. Hawaii is not classified as an outbreak zone, but the presence of the &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; mosquito in the islands means transmission could occur if precautions are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State health officials confirmed that this is the first known Zika case tied to Hawaii travel in more than five years. During the 2015–2017 global Zika outbreak, Hawaii reported multiple travel-linked cases but avoided local spread. Officials hope to continue that record, with visitor cooperation being one key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-the-zika-case-was-detected-in-hawaii"&gt;Where the Zika case was detected in Hawaii.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The individual who tested positive for Zika had visited Waialua and Haleiwa on Oahu’s North Shore. These beachside towns are popular with visitors seeking a quieter alternative to Waikiki, offering access to lush hiking trails among its other attractions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are no closures or travel advisories for the area, but mosquito mitigation teams are spraying and monitoring affected zones. The Department of Health says two other people may also have been exposed and are being evaluated at this time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although no locally transmitted Zika cases have ever occurred in Hawaii, health officials consider any confirmed case reason enough to increase public awareness—especially in places with high visitor traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hawaii-travelers-can-reduce-mosquito-risk"&gt;How Hawaii travelers can reduce mosquito risk.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika prevention is focused around avoiding mosquito bites. Hawaii’s Department of Health recommends taking steps for anyone spending time outdoors, particularly in North Shore communities or other warm, humid parts of the islands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use insect repellent approved by the EPA that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Reapply as needed, especially after swimming or sweating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wear lightweight long sleeves and pants, even during the day. The mosquitoes that carry Zika are active in daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. If not available, use mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eliminate standing water at vacation rentals, including in buckets, planters, and even outdoor toys or gear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, travelers returning from an area with Zika risk—including Hawaii when travel-linked cases are active—should avoid getting bitten for at least three weeks to help prevent mosquito transmission back home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-if-you-have-any-symptoms-after-your-hawaii-trip"&gt;What if you have any symptoms after your Hawaii trip.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zika symptoms are typically mild and may include fever, rash, red eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, or headache. They usually last less than a week and are often missed or mistaken for other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you develop any of these symptoms within two weeks of leaving Hawaii—or any destination where mosquito-borne viruses are possible—contact your doctor and mention your travel history. Testing is usually only done if symptoms are present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though rare, Zika has been associated with serious complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurological issues. Awareness remains the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-north-shore-oahu-travel"&gt;What this means for North Shore Oahu travel.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, travel to Haleiwa and Waialua continues and should pose no issues. Visitors in the area are advised to take basic mosquito precautions, and those planning to visit soon should come prepared with repellent and protective clothing. Taking a few extra steps to prevent bites can help protect you and the islands from more serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that Hawaii has never had a locally transmitted Zika outbreak and that the Department of Health continues to respond quickly when travel-related cases are identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time the North Shore has seen enhanced vector control. It has happened during past alerts for dengue and other mosquito-related issues. Each time, Hawaii avoided wider spread, thanks in part to cooperation from visitors and residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pregnant travelers or those with health concerns should consult the latest CDC guidelines and speak to a medical professional. For most others, a few mosquito precautions are all that’s needed to travel responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-you-re-traveling-to-hawaii-this-summer"&gt;If you’re traveling to Hawaii this summer.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, especially to areas around Haleiwa, take a moment to at least think about mosquito protection. Beat of Hawaii editors will be on Oahu’s north shore in the next couple of weeks and will be doing the same thing. Pack what you need, stay aware, and help protect the islands by being part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

            Who among us wouldn’t want to live a good life well into our 90s, especially if we could do it disease-free while still being as witty and spry as Betty White, as eloquent as Toni Morrison or as civically engaged as Jimmy Carter?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000j3b6m1lvdh8zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you’d need good genes to live that long, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000k3b6msisxvpj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not necessarily, according to Dr. Eric Topol, founding director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, and former chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000l3b6mpag9mxcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For almost 20 years, Topol has been studying a group of 1,400 Super Agers, or people who reached the age of 80 and beyond without developing one of three common, chronic, age-related conditions (cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease), as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/translational-research/genomic-medicine/wellderly/" target="_blank"&gt;Wellderly study&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000m3b6mqsd2vty0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To his surprise, when his team conducted whole-genome sequencing on all the Wellderly study participants, the researchers found nothing genetic, across the board, that conferred an age and health advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000n3b6mbhgp16gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol’s new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668" target="_blank"&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity,&lt;/a&gt;” explores the other factors at play and the science that backs them up. He examines lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and sleep. He also looks at new technologies including the following :
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cmb70ih5k000t3b6m3miv974h@published" class="list-elevate vossi-list" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
  &lt;ul data-editable="items" class="list__items list__items--ul"&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            polygenic risk scores that sift through a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank"&gt;DNA to quantify disease risk&lt;/a&gt;;
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            the new science of “&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202165/" target="_blank"&gt;omics&lt;/a&gt;” (for example, proteomics to analyze  the complete set of proteins expressed by a body) that can be used to produce organ clocks measuring how &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1" target="_blank"&gt;fast our individual organs are aging&lt;/a&gt;; and
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            artificial intelligence to synthesize all available health data points.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000o3b6mpltt83b2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All these technologies show promise  in helping more people, if not reach Super Ager status, then achieve a longer health span by either delaying the onset of disease or aggressively treating conditions to prevent progression and complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000p3b6mlzuq0b72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol, who will soon turn 71, practices what he preaches.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000q3b6mja2pq84s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope to be (a Super Ager),” he told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;If I can get another 10 or 15 years without an age-related disease, that’d be great. And I’ve really doubled down on the things that I can do to help get there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000r3b6m5bov8hs3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exactly which steps has the doctor-scientist who studies Super Agers taken to increase his odds of reaching their ranks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70igyf000s3b6mwz48va7n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmb70ilng000v3b6myuqzim6f@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70hlgm000g3b6m1p0yj2dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I made extensive changes from the research, once we learned that it isn’t in your genes … to achieve healthy aging, free of cancer, free of cardiovascular disease and free of neurodegenerative disease,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h3" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmb70sabr001y3b6mvm0ul65c@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="lessons-taken-to-heart-exercise-sleep-and-diet" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Lessons taken to heart: exercise,    sleep and diet
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s100103b6mcp8hcpfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the biggest changes Topol said he made was to his exercise routine. “I used to only do aerobic exercise, and as a cardiologist, that was my thing,” he said. “Now I do balance training and strength training (as well). It’s an extensive difference. … And so, I’m more strong and fit than I’ve ever been.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200113b6mlf370zjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, exercise is so important that Topol ranks it as No. 1 on the list for anyone who wants to get started on the path of a longer life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200123b6m0y9p5kt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s free. And if you’re not doing anything, if you’re a sedentary, then start with walks, brisk walks if you can, and keep increasing it,” he said. “Challenge yourself (with) hills and pace … if you are working up a sweat, that’s a really good sign.” (Check with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200133b6m9k5mb66t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To get your upper body in shape, he recommends resistance bands, and to improve balance, he said to practice standing on one foot, then the other. “These are all free or cost minimum,” he said, noting that with a few inexpensive items you can do this at home, no gym membership required. “So work on that and then other things will start to fall in place. … If you exercise more, you’ll sleep better, too.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200143b6mz7hofpf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Which brings us to the next major change Topol made.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200153b6metkizjyz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I realized how important (sleep) is because of ‘glymphatics.’ That was a new insight in the book: about deep sleep and getting these waste products out of your brain,” he said, referring to the recently discovered &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which helps flush out waste products in the brain and central nervous system, much like the lymphatic system does for the rest of the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200163b6mwu663meq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a poor sleeper,” he confessed, so he worked “extensively” on improving the different factors that could impact it. “Things like … what do I eat? And when do I eat? Also hydrating, mostly early in the day … to have less interrupted sleep.” He added that for him fasting is “detrimental” to his sleep, as are both exercising or eating a big meal too late in the evening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200173b6m2if5s2lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Agers-Evidence-Based-Approach-Longevity/dp/1668067668" target="_blank"&gt;do not give short shrift to sleep regularity,&lt;/a&gt; Topol advised. “I used to go to sleep all over the place (in terms of time), and now I’m very regimented, except for maybe one night a week,” he said, noting that this tweak was “phenomenally effective” in levelling up his sleep game.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200183b6mt7wshe4t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for diet, Topol (who hasn’t touched red meat in 40 years but does eat fish) said he wasn’t surprised the evidence showed that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;a plant-based diet with enough lean protein&lt;/a&gt; “prevailed as the best.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s200193b6m7fzf49to@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What was interesting, though, is how toxic (and) pro inflammatory &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; were,” he said, adding that he does everything he can to minimize UPF — which he jokingly calls UFOs, or alien food . “It’s hard to get it to zero, but I’ve (made a) conscious effort.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001b3b6m3y0gclgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said he also increased his protein intake “some,” due to his age and because he started strength training, “but I don’t go to toxic levels that are advocated by others, that have no evidence (and) that are pro-inflammatory.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001c3b6mm93mif90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said he keeps protein to about 90 grams a day for his 180-pound (82-kilogram) frame, by adding nuts, legumes (including beans) and more fish, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/business/sardines-tinned-fish-recession-indicator"&gt;even canned tuna&lt;/a&gt; in water, to his diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001d3b6mqgvmrg9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I generally eat a salad every night,” he said. “Now I’m a little more conscious about having something with it. … But (it’s) not the protein craze that’s being advocated by some of the extremists.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h3" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmb70sadk001z3b6mof4hu69q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="supplements-alcohol-and-stress" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Supplements, alcohol and stress
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001f3b6m1q4rj5ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What about supplements and vitamins? “I don’t rule out that they could help (if) you have a specific deficiency — if for some reason your vitamin D is very low, or your vitamin B12,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001g3b6myx0lbxa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “for healthy people who are not symptomatic (and) who take good care of themselves,” he said, “there’s no data to show that these provide any benefit” much less an antiaging one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001h3b6mt2kpmd3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think they’re a waste of money, and some of these supplements have potentially adverse effects,” he said. “It’s just infuriating because they’re not regulated, so (marketers) can say anything, and people believe it and buy it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001i3b6m6929cq62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/a-ground-truth-on-alcohol-intake" target="_blank"&gt;consuming alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, Topol said he keeps his drinking “light,” to fewer than seven drinks per week, after which the risks start adding up quickly. He said it doesn’t seem to affect his own sleep, but it might impact that of others, so he recommends watching out for that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001k3b6mlv60ayhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another top-of-the-list item: mental health and stress management. Topol mainly turns to exercise to help navigate both of these elements, but he said being out in nature is another often-overlooked route.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001l3b6muejyttgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The nature prescription is part of the book. There really is something to this,” he noted, adding that he takes advantage of San Diego’s climate and location to do plenty of hiking and walking. “It’s good for mental health, it’s good for stress and anxiety, just to be out in our environment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001m3b6m7xet5j99@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s never too late to start any or all of these lifestyle adjustments, Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001n3b6mw4r65r8v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These diseases take 20 years at least (to develop). So, you get even more (bang) if you start in your 40s and 50s or 60s … but if you start when  you’re 70 (or) 80, you’re still going to derive years of healthy aging, maybe not quite as many, but still,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001o3b6mi2ujqt53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And because these common, chronic, age-related conditions — cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases — do take so long to fully manifest, Topol said we have time to intervene to change their trajectory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001p3b6mvxgbr1bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But to fully leverage that  latency period before the symptoms of a disease appear, it’s important to be aware of personal risk, so people and their doctors (and society more broadly) can focus prevention and early detection efforts on the right people at the right time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001q3b6mco9etl5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Knowing one’s risk — that’s the next part, which is: we’re going to prevent these three diseases in the future. We can now, and we’re going to even get better at that,” Topol said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001r3b6mr5ecws9z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said he learned from his polygenic risk scores that he’s at high risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/coronary-artery-disease.html" target="_blank"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt;, despite not having a family history. So, he has focused on getting his LDL cholesterol down. “I’ve gotten it low, and perhaps I got more aggressive about that. I’ve checked my other lipids, like &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2024/lipoproteina-what-know-about-elevated-levels" target="_blank"&gt;Lp(a)&lt;/a&gt; (lipoprotein[a]), so I feel like I’ve done everything I can to go into high prevent-mode for that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb70s9s2001s3b6m07aqw23n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Topol said wants to get his &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-first-diagnostic-immunome" target="_blank"&gt;immunome&lt;/a&gt; (all the genes and proteins of his immune system) mapped, to measure how well his immune system is functioning. It’s a measurement he believes will one day soon be commonplace for everyone. He already has data on “every virus I’ve ever been exposed to and every autoantibody that I have.”

            He also plans on having his organ clocks measured, because different organs (such as the heart and brain) age at different rates, putting people at higher risk for certain diseases. “I think it’s going to be very helpful, because then I’ll know (how) my heart organ clock correlates with my risk of heart disease.

            “It’s an extraordinary time in medicine, because we have a path to prevention,” Topol said, “because of the way the science of aging (is developing), with these metrics like organ clocks and protein biomarkers and our genetics — all these layers of data — we are going to be able to prevent these diseases. And that’s exciting. We’ve never done that before.”

The researchers also found that certain genetic differences are associated with how much caffeine people drink and how sensitive they are to its effects. While caffeine use was not strongly linked to sleep satisfaction, people who said caffeine interfered with their sleep typically consumed less of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to explore how caffeine consumption, sleep satisfaction, and psychological distress are connected in people with a history of depression, and whether genetic variants might explain some of these associations. Caffeine is the world’s most widely used psychoactive substance, often praised for its alertness-boosting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at higher doses, or in sensitive individuals, caffeine can increase anxiety and interfere with sleep. Although research has shown that moderate caffeine use may reduce the risk of developing depression in otherwise healthy individuals, less is known about its effects in people who have already been diagnosed or treated for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine is common, viewed as safe, and increasingly marketed toward and consumed by younger people,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-mcintosh-845a10298/"&gt;Harry McIntosh&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD student at the University of Queensland. “At the same time, mental health problems are on the rise and insomnia is an important symptom of a number of mental health disorders. We’re interested in caffeine consumption because it may be something that people suffering from mental health problems can change to improve their mental health and sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, the researchers used data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study. Over 11,000 adults who had been diagnosed with or treated for depression completed detailed questionnaires about their caffeine consumption, sleep, and mental health. Of those, about 9,000 also provided DNA samples, allowing researchers to examine genetic differences previously linked to caffeine metabolism and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine consumption was measured by asking participants how many servings of caffeinated coffee, tea, soft drinks, and energy drinks they typically drank per day. Participants were grouped into low (0–2 drinks), medium (3–5 drinks), or high (6 or more drinks) caffeine consumers. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, a commonly used measure of anxiety and depression symptoms. Sleep satisfaction was measured with a single question from the Insomnia Severity Index. Participants were also asked whether they felt caffeine interfered with their ability to sleep, which served as a proxy for caffeine sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then used linear regression models to examine how caffeine use was related to distress and sleep satisfaction, adjusting for factors such as age, sex, body mass index, and other substance use (including alcohol, nicotine, and painkillers). They also looked at whether specific genetic variants were linked to caffeine intake and sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that participants who drank six or more caffeinated drinks per day scored higher on the psychological distress scale than those who consumed fewer drinks. For each additional caffeinated beverage consumed per day, participants’ distress scores increased by 0.2 points on a 50-point scale. While this is a small effect, it was statistically significant. People in the medium caffeine group (3–5 drinks per day) did not differ significantly from those in the low group, suggesting that only higher levels of consumption are linked to greater distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there was little evidence that caffeine consumption negatively affected sleep satisfaction in this group. Although those with higher caffeine intake reported slightly lower sleep satisfaction, the difference was small and did not remain statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected caffeine consumption to be associated with poorer sleep, which it wasn’t,” McIntosh told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, caffeine sensitivity itself appeared to play a larger role. People who reported that caffeine interfered with their sleep were far less likely to drink large amounts of it. Each additional caffeinated drink consumed per day was associated with a 16% lower likelihood of reporting caffeine sensitivity. This suggests that people may naturally reduce their intake if they notice it disrupts their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People naturally adjust how much caffeine they consume based on how they respond to it,” McIntosh said. “If caffeine was negatively impacting you, you’d probably reduce your intake accordingly, this could explain why caffeine was not associated with poor sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic analysis offered further insight into why some people consume more caffeine than others. Several genetic variants were associated with differences in caffeine intake. For example, a variant near the &lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt; gene (rs4410790) was linked to increased caffeine use, while a variant near the &lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt; gene (rs2472297) was linked to lower consumption. These genes are involved in caffeine metabolism. People with faster metabolism may consume more caffeine to maintain the same level of alertness, while slower metabolizers may consume less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate variant near the &lt;em&gt;MMS22L/POU3F2&lt;/em&gt; genes (rs34645063) was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting caffeine sensitivity. This finding is consistent with earlier research showing that this genetic region may be linked to both lower caffeine consumption and increased sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other variants in genes like &lt;em&gt;ADORA2A&lt;/em&gt;—which encodes a receptor targeted by caffeine in the brain—were only weakly linked to consumption and did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Still, the results suggest that genetic differences play a role in shaping both how much caffeine people consume and how their bodies respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is focused on those diagnosed with depression,” McIntosh told PsyPost. “Higher caffeine consumption was associated with higher reported levels of current stress in people regardless of sleep quality. The effect size was not large but was statistically significant. However, we cannot assign a causal relationship because participants may increase caffeine consumption in response to symptoms of depression such as fatigue or lack of motivation. Common genetic variants play a sizeable role in how our body handles caffeine and were associated with consuming a larger or smaller number of caffeinated drinks each day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main strengths of the study is its large sample size and inclusion of genetic data, which allowed researchers to detect even small effects. However, there are some limitations to consider. The data were cross-sectional, meaning they captured only one moment in time. This makes it difficult to determine cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data has only one timepoint and measures variables instead of controlling them experimentally, so we cannot use it to definitively state that caffeine is causing distress, or that people with higher stress are then choosing to consume more caffeine,” McIntosh noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another caveat is that the study sample consisted entirely of people with a history of depression. This means the results may not apply to the general population, especially those without mental health conditions. Future research using more precise measures of caffeine intake and longitudinal designs could help clarify how these relationships unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000545393" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Caffeine Consumption, Psychological Distress, and Insomnia in a Cohort of Individuals with Depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Harry A.

If You Have High Cholesterol, According to Experts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, raising your risk for heart attack and stroke. Adopting lifestyle changes you can sustain can help get your cholesterol levels in check, which is essential for managing your long-term health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the start of your day is a crucial time to get on track with these healthy habits, how you wind down the day matters, too. Nutrition experts share the top four habits they want you to avoid after 5 p.m. if you have high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Snacking &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snacking later in the evening may lead to eating more overall calories and a greater intake of saturated fat and added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.jenngilesrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jennifer O’Donnell-Giles, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, agrees that late-night snacking tends to involve processed foods that are high in fat and sugar, which can raise LDL cholesterol: “The excess calories and lack of movement late at night make them more likely to be stored as fat. Choose nutrient-dense options or skip the snack if you’re not truly hungry.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself overdoing it on the p.m. snacking, then you may want to look at what you’re noshing on earlier in the day. Not eating balanced meals during the day can leave you feeling hungry. Ensuring that your meals include a mix of fiber-filled carbohydrates, healthy fats and lean protein can help you feel satisfied. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, mindless snacking at night can also be due to stress or some other cause. “Tuning into hunger cues is important while also knowing if it’s a habitual thing, boredom thing or true hunger,” says O’Donnell-Giles. If you choose to snack, consider it an opportunity to add nutrients to your diet that can help manage cholesterol. “Adding foods that are high in fiber, like oatmeal, whole grains, chia seeds, beans, fruits and veggies, can help lower cholesterol levels,” says&lt;a href="https://www.farmingtonvalleynutrition.com/about" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Amy Woodman, RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Skipping Your Regular Bedtime &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping a consistent bedtime routine isn’t just for kids—it benefits adults, too. An inconsistent sleep schedule can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which is detrimental to sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This, in turn, can have a negative effect on cholesterol levels. “Sleep impacts cholesterol more than most people realize,” says O’Donnell-Giles, emphasizing that poor or inconsistent sleep can raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not getting enough sleep can lead to increases in cortisol and inflammation, both of which can have negative impacts on cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Adequate sleep, along with a regular bedtime, helps regulate lipid metabolism and reduces inflammation,” says O’Donnell-Giles. Not getting enough sleep also disrupts hormones that regulate hunger and fullness, which can negatively affect food choices throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To combat these effects, find a bedtime that works for your schedule while also aiming for at least seven hours of sleep per night. Tips like avoiding screens in the few hours before bed and skipping large meals close to bedtime can help improve your sleep quality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Drinking Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on alcohol can benefit your health, including your cholesterol levels. But if you choose to drink, know that &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you drink also plays a role in managing your cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking later in the day, especially within a few hours of bedtime, may help you fall asleep, but your overall quality of sleep could suffer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And we know falling short on quality sleep consistently can increase inflammation and cortisol levels, in turn, negatively affecting cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s no ideal time of day to drink alcohol to avoid these negative health effects, the late-night intake may be particularly bad for cholesterol for a variety of reasons. “Late-night alcohol can increase triglycerides, disrupt sleep and trigger poor food choices,” says O’Donnell-Giles. “I recommend limiting alcohol—especially at night—if you’re working to lower cholesterol.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead, try making a&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7967514/healthy-summer-mocktails-for-mocktail-summer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; mocktail&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; infused water&lt;/a&gt; as a special drink, versus one that contains alcohol. Making this swap even a few nights per week can help improve your sleep quality while also lowering total calorie intake, particularly if you choose low- or no-added-sugar beverages in place of alcohol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In general, it’s best to limit excess saturated fat and added sugar in the diet, especially if you are prioritizing heart health. Eating foods that are high in one or more of these nutrients later in the day can result in unintentionally adding excess calories, saturated fat and added sugar to your diet. “Unfortunately, the most common after-dinner snacks that people tend to reach for are chips or sweets that are often high in saturated fats,” says Woodman. Research indicates that eating later in the night leads to greater caloric intake overall and is associated with poor diet quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, it’s best to skip fried foods, heavy fatty meals, sugary desserts, processed carbs and mindless snacking, says O’Donnell-Giles. “Focus instead on balanced, whole-food dinners with fiber, lean protein and healthy fats.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing your cholesterol requires making sustainable lifestyle changes. This includes changes to your nightly routine, like what and when you eat, as well as improving your sleep hygiene. “Focus on fiber, healthy fats (think avocados, nuts, olive oil), lean protein and whole grains,” says&lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbybess.com/old-about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Bess Berger, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you choose to snack late at night, stick to whole, nutrient-dense foods that are filling and satisfying. Get on a consistent schedule to promote healthy sleep habits. Berger recommends turning off electronics before bed and aiming for seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Remember, managing your health is a 24-hour job, and mixing up your nightly routine to better support your health will go a long way in helping you reach your long-term goals to feel your best.&lt;br&gt;

That number skyrocketed to 23,207 in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase is attributed to the rise in alcohol consumption and its established role as a carcinogen, contributing to various cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more someone drinks both in volume and frequency, the higher the risk,” Moffitt Cancer Center epidemiologist Kathleen Egan stated. “When we drink, our bodies break down alcohol into acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen that can damage DNA. That damaged DNA can create mutations that can cause cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For all the news that the Hudson Valley is sharing, make sure to follow &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/HudsonValleyPost"&gt;Hudson Valley Post on Facebook,&lt;/a&gt; and download the &lt;a href="https://hudsonvalleypost.com/app/"&gt;Hudson Valley Post Mobile App &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study says alcohol-related cancer deaths are seen the most in men aged 55 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;U.S. Surgeon General Warns About Link Between Alcohol and Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent U.S. Surgeon General's advisory, alcohol is linked to &lt;a href="//hudsonvalleypost.com/?p=201148"&gt;100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths each year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials note, alcohol is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization labeled alcohol a carcinogen in the late 1980s, saying that no amount is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;LOOK: Counties with the highest cancer rates in New York&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;LOOK: Counties with the highest cancer rates in New York&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stacker.com/new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Stacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; ranked the counties with the highest cancer rates in New York using data from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Stacker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Reading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cancer Causing Chemicals Found In 37 Popular Food Items&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;Cancer Causing Chemicals Found In 37 Popular Food Items&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the list below for food items and their total phthalates per serving according to a study from Consumer Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photogallery-credit"&gt;Gallery Credit: Jessica Poxson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7 Of The Most Dangerous Jobs In New York&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-wrapper blog-photogallery "&gt;&lt;h2 class="photogallery-title"&gt;7 Of The Most Dangerous Jobs In New York&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="photogallery-description"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, a lot of New Yorkers end up hurt or sick because of the work they do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zlotolaw.com/blog/seven-of-the-most-dangerous-professions-in-new-york/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zlotolow &amp;amp; Associates reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that number grows into the thousands.

Positive confirmation of avian flu was received on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected poultry farm in this case, which was confirmed to be Hickman's Family Farms by the company itself, has been placed under quarantine, and measures were reportedly quickly put in place to eliminate the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eggs produced after the onset of clinical signs of illness have not entered the food supply, and there have been no signs of illness in humans. Consumers in Arizona and around the nation can remain confident in the safety and quality of eggs and egg products," agricultural officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk to the general public is considered to be low, with those most at risk of exposure being individuals who are directly involved with the daily care of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is reportedly the second commercial farm located in Maricopa County with poultry that tested positive this month. ABC15 has not confirmed the name of the second location.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-west-valley/buckeye/help-on-the-way-for-arizona-egg-farmer-getting-shelled-by-bird-flu"&gt;ABC15 reported on cases of avian flu at Hickman's&lt;/a&gt;. At that point, the farm said it had lost more than one million egg-laying hens (20% of its flock) at one of its farms due to the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;See coverage from February 2025 in the video player below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

According to &lt;a href="https://www.jackiemorrisonlmft.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jackie Morrison" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jackiemorrisonlmft.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Jackie Morrison&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Minnesota, the ADHD brain filters information in a different manner than a neurotypical brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is known to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adhd-signs-women_l_663cd48de4b0fe081b305083" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cause trouble focusing and inattention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6830a438e4b0a3c83b17f365" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="663cd48de4b0fe081b305083" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;cause trouble focusing and inattention&lt;/a&gt; in folks with the disorder, which can, of course, also lead to trouble on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is, in a lot of cases, a truly different amount of information that is coming in. And your brain isn’t filtering out as many distractions,” explained Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so things that an ADHD brain is picking up on might be significantly more than a neurotypical brain, and so there are literally more distractions sometimes for an ADHD brain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an ADHD brain, you need more stimulation and engagement to get your brain in the “task-positive network,” said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The task-positive network is the grouping of your brain systems that turn on and activate when you’re engaged in a task and helps you focus,” she added. If there isn’t enough stimulation, which can happen when you’re driving, your brain isn’t going to go in this network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that doesn’t mean an individual with ADHD should be nervous about driving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both experts stressed that these research findings don’t mean that individual ADHD drivers are any worse than other drivers on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can say on a population level that ... having a disorder that impairs your attention does increase the risk for driving accidents in that population, but you can’t say anything about a particular individual,” Cronenwett noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaning, someone with an ADHD diagnosis who manages their ADHD properly can be a safer driver than someone without ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would caution against people looking at the ADHD label as either a flag for ‘now I’m at risk’ versus not at risk,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because people with ADHD can be very well-treated, and their symptoms can be under control, and they can be quite safe,” explained Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distracted driving, in general, can lead to traffic incidents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because someone doesn’t have ADHD doesn’t mean they’re a safe driver by default. There are plenty of other distractions — cellphones, other passengers, day-to-day stress, exhaustion and more — that can put anyone at a higher risk of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, “people won’t be able to pay as good attention to the road when they are fatigued,” said Cronenwett.

Are you distracted because of an argument with your partner? This way, you can decide if you have the faculties to safely operate your car. And this is true for anyone — not just those with ADHD, said Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any number of things influence somebody’s risk more than just the strict presence or absence of a label,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel focused enough to drive, don’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we can all agree that distracted drivers, or inattentive drivers, are at risk for having car crashes, and they should certainly be very, very careful in their own driving habits,” said Cronenwett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, people can be distracted because they’re tired, because of stressful social situations or even from depression and anxiety, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, any type of inattentive or distracted driving puts somebody at risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an ADHD diagnosis and want one, Morrison said it could be a good idea to find a doctor or therapist in the field who has an understanding of ADHD and can help you learn more about how your brain works so you can efficiently and safely move through the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who can’t get diagnosed because of a lack of insurance coverage, long appointment wait times or for whatever reason, Morrison recommends mindfulness as a way to combat distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be aware of your body in space and your breath for a few minutes at a time, and let thoughts move in and out ... you’re just experiencing what it’s like to be in your body at that moment in time. [It] can be really helpful because it gives your brain a chance to run around off its leash, if you will, and it also gives you practice being present without distracting yourself and without stimulation,” Morrison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And when you’re driving, it can be boring — so, basically you’re practicing getting bored,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can also be helpful to train your brain to move slower, said Morrison — “because the ADHD brain wants to go fast and it wants to be efficient, even though, arguably, it can be very inefficient at times.” Instead of rushing to prep food or unpack your groceries, take your time while doing it, said Morrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[This] can be helpful just to help your body become more comfortable with that inefficiency or that slowness,” Morrison noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body and brain want to move fast, and that’s not always the safest option when driving, so you’re literally helping your body to practice being slow and inefficient, to just get used to that discomfort,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

It came with bright packaging and even brighter promises. But now, science seems to be rewriting that story. New research from Brigham Young University (BYU) and German institutions has cast a careful light on fruit juice, suggesting that this popular ‘healthy drink’ might not be so harmless after all, especially when it comes to the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s all we need to know about what the study found, and look at some truly nourishing substitutes that could be better for metabolic health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The old belief: Fruit juice equals good health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, fruit juice has enjoyed a healthy reputation. After all, it's made from fruits. It’s full of vitamins, especially vitamin C, and it feels like a cleaner, more natural choice compared to fizzy drinks. No wonder it's a staple in breakfast spreads, children's tiffin boxes, and fitness cafés.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch, most fruit juices lack the very thing that makes whole fruits so beneficial: fibre. Plus, what gets left behind is sugar, a lot of it, in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The new reality: Juice and diabetes risk, what the study says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent BYU-led &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, is one of the most detailed meta-analyses ever conducted on this topic. Researchers tracked data from over 500,000 individuals across various countries. Their goal was simple: understand how different forms of sugar affect diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here’s what they found:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every additional 230ml serving of fruit juice per day was associated with a 5% increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, sugar-sweetened beverages like soda raised the risk by 25% per 350ml serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural sugars eaten in foods like fruits or dairy didn’t carry the same risk, and sometimes, were linked with lower diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message? Drinking sugar, even if it’s from juice, hits the body harder than eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why drinking sugar is more dangerous than eating it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sugar is consumed through drinks, it rushes into the bloodstream quickly, triggering a spike in blood glucose. This sudden overload can overwork the liver and disrupt insulin sensitivity, both red flags for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole foods, on the other hand, deliver sugars in a package that includes fibre, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. This slows down digestion, keeps glucose levels more stable, and prevents that sugar "rush" that overwhelms the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while fruit juice may have originated from a good place — the fruit itself — the journey it takes before reaching the glass removes much of what made the fruit healthy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Here are some smart swaps that can be refreshing and gentle on blood sugar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Whole fruit smoothies (with pulp and fibre intact)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of juice, blending whole fruits, skin, pulp, and all, helps retain fibre, which slows down sugar absorption. Toss in a spoonful of chia seeds or flaxseeds for a bonus dose of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Infused water with herbs and fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slices of cucumber, lemon, berries, or mint can turn plain water into a delicious drink.

Of course, it’s not only Ozempic that’s creating fragile, crepe paper-like skin on body parts everywhere. There’s the rise of “&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-treat-neck-wrinkles" target="_blank"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt;” to consider, and other causes that far predate laptops and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite Crepey Skin Treatments:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Crepey skin is the result of both natural aging and external factors. Over time, our skin loses collagen and elastin, becomes thinner, and is less able to repair itself,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://hunzahealthspan.com/pages/whitney-tolpinrud-md-faad" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://hunzahealthspan.com/pages/whitney-tolpinrud-md-faad"}' href="https://hunzahealthspan.com/pages/whitney-tolpinrud-md-faad" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Whitney Tolpinrud, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist and medical director at Agency by Curology. She adds that sun exposure plays a major role in the development of crepey skin, as do hormonal shifts, oxidative stress, and environmental damage. So, how does one keep it tight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Effective treatments for crepey skin are available both at home and in the office,” says Tolpinrud. Above all, she stresses that using a broad-spectrum &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-sunscreens" target="_blank"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; with SPF 30 or above is essential every day, while additional topical treatments can certainly help. Flooded with ingredients ranging from retinol to alpha-hydroxy acids, humectants, and peptides, the best crepey skin treatments address collagen loss, skin thinning, and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE1LdzBuZW1lQi1SZXd0bDhtNS1pQTUyaFFyLTEzaW4tcVRqS1BnZmZyT3NDbFkwV01OcGNWc2QwNzVRbDNLT0tkclRWVEJFam1CeURWY2lYVXBRS1VTeDNyd1dB</guid></item><item><title>维生素D补充剂可能有助于将衰老延缓3年-今日医学新闻 | Vitamin D supplements may help slow down aging by 3 years - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPYzVkcmoyRE5vcmFDdVdTNENLOTJDclZ6UV9QS1RGUEg4b1hKXzJNbThTM0dLaUZNU002TXBZbGV3d1M0ZDVudkhmUjhtaC1FVmVzQm4yTU1fTEY4QjlNUVFnbmQ4d2hkVS16WDZvZl9Cb19mUVFZQUlIWl9NcWhuWUFQalpTRzFZQ05Udjhxd3Y2ZmN3QWpmalVZb2xJX0loQ045dm9VdUZxQ2Z5b1MwcHJIZkk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Vitamin-D-Stocksy_txp9cee8cfcS68400_Medium_1070845-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Vitamin-D-Stocksy_txp9cee8cfcS68400_Medium_1070845-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Vitamin-D-Stocksy_txp9cee8cfcS68400_Medium_1070845-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Vitamin-D-Stocksy_txp9cee8cfcS68400_Medium_1070845-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="An older adult woman looks slightly to the side, outside as the sun shines on her in front of a glass panel building" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fvitamin-d-supplements-may-slow-biological-aging-preserve-telomere-length&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F05%2FVitamin-D-Stocksy_txp9cee8cfcS68400_Medium_1070845-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Vitamin%20D%20supplements%20may%20help%20slow%20down%20aging%20by%203%20years" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Vitamin-D-Stocksy_txp9cee8cfcS68400_Medium_1070845-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Vitmain D supplements may impact etelemore length and helo slow down aging, according to new research.

Either condition of cell inactivity or death is thought to contribute to aging and age-related diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers found that vitamin D supplementation helped minimize telomere shortening in white blood cells, which could help slow down biological aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;VITAL trial&lt;/a&gt;. This trial included a representative sample of adults in the United States who received vitamin D3 supplements, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, or both for around five years. It was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, so some participants received the supplements while others received the placebo. All female participants were at least fifty-five years old, and all male participants were at least fifty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data specifically examined a cohort that visited the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Centre. At baseline and follow-up visits, participants participated in in-person assessments and provided fasting blood samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined telomere length in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukocyte" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;leukocytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, which are the body’s white blood cells, among participants who received supplements and those who received the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to analyze over 2,500 samples from over 1,000 participants. They examined telomere length at baseline and at two- and four-year follow-up, though some data was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted a statistical analysis using models to adjust for various covariates. They also did an exploratory subgroup analysis to see how different factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, impacted results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D vs. omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from a higher body mass index in the omega-3 fatty acid supplement group, the placebo and intervention groups had similar baseline characteristics. Missing data was also similar between the two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin D appeared to have a positive impact on telomere length. Among participants who received vitamin D, there was only minimal shortening of telomere length at two and four years. In contrast, there was substantial telomere shortening in the placebo group at both time points. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation appeared to have no significant impact on telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subgroup analysis further suggested that the effects of vitamin D on telomere length were significant for participants not taking medication for cholesterol, but not for participants who were taking cholesterol medication. Vitamin D also minimized telomere shortening at a statistically significant level for non-white participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no significant interaction with body mass index, but researchers did observe that participants who were not obese had significantly minimized telomere shortening. Also, taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements did not appear to impact the role of vitamin D on telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis of telomere length in this study population does have some limitations. First, most participants were white, and all participants were at least fifty, so it may not be possible to generalize the findings to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers acknowledge that this was a post-hoc analysis of an already completed study and that the study was not originally designed to look at the effects of supplements on leukocyte telomere length. The analysis also excluded participants who did not have data on leukocyte telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that unaccounted-for factors influenced the results, and the study also has any other limitations found in the original study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding exploratory subgroup analysis results, researchers encourage caution, note limited power, and say people should look at the data as “hypothesis-generating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four years, there were about 37% missing cases. Researchers acknowledge that this reduced power and could be why they did not find omega-3 fatty acid supplementation affected leukocyte telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can explore why vitamin D may have these effects on telomere length. For example, it could be related to an enzyme called telomerase that helps to lengthen telomeres and how vitamin D may protect against DNA damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler also noted the following limitations of the study: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study involved only a relatively small number of people, looked only at telomeres in white blood cells, and did not look extensively at the health impact of these telomere changes. So, the clinical implications one can derive from this study are quite limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests the potential benefits of vitamin D in relation to aging. The authors suggest that the preservation of telomere length in this study “could mean a 3-year decrease in aging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As we know already, vitamin D supports bone, immune system and reduces inflammation, but this study is linked directly with telomere preservation which ties into aging and disease prevention. This [study] gives more of a general idea that vitamin D3 could do more than just helping your bones but actually slowing down the cellular age, impressive!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this is confirmed in future studies, this could mean that daily [vitamin D} supplements could actually help reduce risks for age-related diseases. This is a door for new medical guidelines in the future and will be a huge deal for preventive medicine.”&lt;br&gt;— Yoshua Quinones, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s also important to note the potential risks of vitamin D supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While 2,000 units of vitamin D is unlikely to have any negative effects, there may be some risk to vitamin D supplements as they can cause kidney damage and other adverse effects in excessive quantities. Since vitamin D is fat soluble, it can accumulate in our bodies, causing toxicity. So, any potential, as yet unproven benefits of vitamin D need to be weighed against its known risks,” Cutler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 10:27:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPYzVkcmoyRE5vcmFDdVdTNENLOTJDclZ6UV9QS1RGUEg4b1hKXzJNbThTM0dLaUZNU002TXBZbGV3d1M0ZDVudkhmUjhtaC1FVmVzQm4yTU1fTEY4QjlNUVFnbmQ4d2hkVS16WDZvZl9Cb19mUVFZQUlIWl9NcWhuWUFQalpTRzFZQ05Udjhxd3Y2ZmN3QWpmalVZb2xJX0loQ045dm9VdUZxQ2Z5b1MwcHJIZkk</guid></item><item><title>为什么36至46岁对您的健康来说是最关键的十年-《每日电讯报》 | Why 36 to 46 is the most critical decade for your health - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOWFhMTXpSSVd5ZWdHSkZMSEZBdVUyRjZZazl4ck1wWHJsTWgyYXNJeVl3YzFIUlhxeWxqNU4wR2RwNnZzN0hqNDdzS1VjM3h2eF9EQzB3TllMTE10amJaNDg0MXRGZGNkU1F0WnFUUng4TWpNR3FsZ2lxd3NBSGdaLURqZzF0MG4zcU5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;For many of us, our 20s are a decade of hedonism – of giving barely a passing thought to our health. It’s the era where we chain smoke, binge drink and shun exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that by their mid-30s, this kind of party lifestyle will take its toll. Researchers in Finland found there were relatively few consequences to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/alcohol-gut-microbiome/"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt; and smoking in people’s 20s, but those who continued these habits found their health begin to deteriorate at 36. Over the course of their lifetime, they were found to result in a plethora of health problems including higher rates of depression, cancer, heart disease, lung disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the decade from 36 to 46 is a pivotal one for our future wellbeing. “What you do in that window shapes the health you’ll experience in the decades to come,” says Dr Philip Borg, an NHS oncologist and founder of The Longevity Doctor, a clinic specialising in preventative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Accumulative damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s in our mid to late-30s that we stop “getting away” with unhealthy behaviour, as the cumulative effects of our lifestyle begin to show their impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic diseases are caused by long-term, silent processes like inflammation, triggered by habits including poor diet, stress, drinking, smoking and lack of exercise, which can slowly damage your cells, arteries and brain, starting decades before symptoms appear,” says Dr Borg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this age, much of the damage can be undone – for instance, people who quit smoking by the age of 35 were shown in a 2022 &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797597" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of half a million Americans to have a similar long-term mortality risk to people who have never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/decline-in-lung-cancer-greatest-modern-medical-achievement/"&gt;rates of lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; caused by smoking begin to rise steadily in the 40-44 age range, steadily for women and more rapidly for men, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my clinic, I frequently see patients who wish they’d stopped habits like smoking earlier,” says Dr James Wilson, a consultant clinical oncologist at UCLH. “Age 36-46 is when we start to see patients developing conditions such as cancer, which could have been avoided with lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because the damage to within our cells builds up increasingly quickly from this age onwards. “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/senescent-cells/"&gt;Senescent cells&lt;/a&gt; are ones which have stopped dividing but are still active, and create an inflammatory environment which damages neighbouring cells,” explains Dr Borg. “The more unhealthy your lifestyle, the more of these cells you accumulate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption is linked to seven types of cancer, including breast and bowel, with 17,000 cases of cancer attributed to alcohol every year in the UK. Again, its impact increases past the age of 35, as our ability to metabolise it decreases and the damage it causes to the liver accumulates, putting us at increased risk of liver disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you’ve exposed your body to excessive drinking during this decade, you can’t reverse the risk,” says Dr Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;A decade of change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decade from 36 to 46 is a time in which women in particular, but also men, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/sex/why-your-sex-drive-changes-every-stage-of-life/"&gt;go through vast hormonal changes&lt;/a&gt;, which play a major role in our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, oestrogen and progesterone begins to decline as menopause approaches. “This affects everything, from a decrease in muscle mass and bone density, to lower immunity and our ability to process sugar and fats,” says Dr Harpal Bains, a longevity specialist and the medical director at Harpal Clinic. It also increases women’s risk of diseases including &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/early-warning-signs-osteoporosis/"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, diabetes, depression, obesity and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men’s testosterone levels peak in their early 30s and begin to drop after that. A recent &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Stanford University revealed a similar spike in age-related issues among men in their 40s, including weaker bones and poorer metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

They are normally found inside tumors, trying to eliminate cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When cancer cells grow and multiply, they can overcome these cells, keeping them from effectively performing their cancer-fighting role. The goal of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, or TIL therapy, is to get rid of the cancer cells by blocking the bad cells and unleashing immune cells from the patient's own body to attack the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In June 2024, shortly after Konkol received his cancer diagnosis, the Froedtert &amp;amp; MCW Cancer Networkbecame the only center in the state certified and one of 80 approved centers nationwide to provide &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-lifileucel-unresectable-or-metastatic-melanoma" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lifileucel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The drug is manufactured by &lt;a href="https://www.iovance.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Iovance Biotherapeutics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Froedtert &amp;amp; MCW were involved in the phase two clinical trials, with three patients receiving the treatment. Konkol is the first patient to receive the treatment in Wisconsin who is not involved in a clinical trial. Two others have since received treatment, with a third scheduled to begin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Patients like Konkol who qualify for the therapy must first undergo seven consecutive days of chemotherapy, similar to what is done to patients prior to a bone marrow transplant, said Harker-Murray, who oversaw the drug's clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The goal of that chemotherapy is to clear out a patient's immune cells within their own body and bone marrow to make room for the TIL product,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once the seven days of chemotherapy are completed, the patient is admitted to Froedtert's bone marrow transplant unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Then, similar to a blood transfusion, a newly grown batch of the patient's own lymphocytes is infused back into the patient's bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Once the infusion is completed, the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit and given up to six doses of a hormone that spurs the growth of the lymphocyte cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Once they are in the bloodstream, they just know what to do," Harker-Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If all goes as planned, the robust number of newly grown lymphocytes will overpower the cancer cells, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The patient experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Cancer patients must meet certain criteria to be a candidate for the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They need to have stage 4 cancer or a tumor that cannot be completely removed by surgery that has progressed, despite receiving chemotherapy and immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Candidates cannot have active, untreated spots of brain cancer. They need to pass a pulmonary test and a cardiac stress test if they have had prior heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And the pace at which their cancer is spreading can’t be too quick, Harker-Murray said, since the process takes two to three months, including the time for the drug manufacturer to grow the new, healthy cancer-fighting cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Candidates must also have one melanoma spot at least 1.5 to 4 cm in size to take to remove as a lymph node sample and at least one other spot of cancer visible on a CT scan, which allows doctors to monitor the therapy’s effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Konkol met the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Patients have to stay relatively close to the hospital during the first 28 days, as patients experience the standard chemotherapy side effects that follow a bone marrow transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Konkols decided the best option for them was to stay at &lt;a href="https://kathys-house.org/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Kathy's House&lt;/a&gt; for most of Rusty's care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Located one block from the hospital's cancer clinic, the facility allows patients of all ages who are receiving treatment at a nearby hospital to stay for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Meals are provided and some insurances cover the cost to stay. Otherwise, a one bedroom is $50 per night and a two-bedroom suite is $60. Financial assistance is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Kathy's House is a godsend," Lynn Konkel said. "It made our lives so much easier to even survive this ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They stayed 36 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/20/PMJS/83737644007-cancer-treatment-0159.JPG?crop=5583,3986,x116,y393&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=472&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/20/PMJS/83737644007-cancer-treatment-0159.JPG?crop=5583,3986,x116,y393&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=944&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Rusty Konkol becomes emotional as he discusses his cancer journey with his wife Linda after an appointment at the Clinical Cancer Center at Froedtert Hospital Campus in Milwaukee, April 23, 2025.

"My life returned to what it was like before I had cancer.

Instead of asking him to wait until the morning, his nurse in the intensive care unit helped him move from his bed to a chair at 1 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Anything you want done, they'd bend over backwards for you," he said of Froedtert staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He completed his treatment in February.

They said that whenever possible, you should always prioritize getting your protein from real food,  such as plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese,  hard-boiled eggs, nuts and sliced turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZPBKOJJNJBZDLL3SRPUVOGXPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it’s fine to have a protein bar several times a week for convenience, said Zumpano, especially if the alternative is junk food. “I would rather someone choose a protein bar over a bag of chips from a vending machine,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORVLGL64Q5CYBM7NW47A2ZUTK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what you should avoid when choosing protein bars — and better ingredients and brands to seek out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OE4CYN6OBBGWBLTFPGNJLD7EKM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OE4CYN6OBBGWBLTFPGNJLD7EKM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Avoid these red flags&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="KP3OUQZT3NCCHNCBHFIJUNWBCA" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hyvuql-isBold-true wpds-c-esEUdQ-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KP3OUQZT3NCCHNCBHFIJUNWBCA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Excessive amounts of added sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWZZ3HQ3VZBQRNUFSNJ3AT4JOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s okay to eat protein bars that are lightly sweetened with such things as dates and honey, especially if you exercise, said Amy Stephens, a sports dietitian at New York University. Carbohydrates replenish your body’s glycogen stores and help your body use protein to build muscle, she added. But you should avoid bars that are loaded with added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJ37L5SL6FGXHPEVPG6C7G5IU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a general rule, look for bars that have an added sugar content that is less than half the total amount of carbs, Stephens said. If a bar has 20 grams of carbs, for example, then it should contain less than 10 grams of added sugar. If it has more than that, it’s best to find another option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5SY2LBP7RERXKSD7VE64NXXLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Don’t be duped by bars that claim they have little or no sugar. In many cases, these bars are made with artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes. “If a protein bar has one gram of sugar but it’s loaded with artificial sweeteners then I would not consider that healthier than a protein bar that has just a little honey or dates in it for sweetness,” said Zumpano at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZA7555TYCNESTGPN26NOVJFP3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amount of sugar you’d be cutting from your diet is likely minimal anyway, and research suggests that sugar substitutes may&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have surprising side effects. Some have been &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/9/1681/153434/Artificial-Sweeteners-and-Risk-of-Type-2-Diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, said Allison Sylvetsky, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. “That raises the question of whether they really are helpful or not,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TGUKWMPMPVAIXGNJWPUFMJYHJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Common sugar substitutes in protein bars include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="2NWJO3P6YZE2DGG3754LUJEZBM" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sugar alcohols&lt;/b&gt; such as erythritol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/b&gt;  such as sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame potassium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Natural” sweeteners&lt;/b&gt; such as stevia, allulose and monk fruit extract. These low and no-calorie sweeteners are derived from plants, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re better for you, Sylvetsky said. “There’s a consumer perception that they’re healthier because they’re from plants,” she added. “But there’s not much evidence to support that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FQJDFY5AP5E4VC2YI7UW2C7DQE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FQJDFY5AP5E4VC2YI7UW2C7DQE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to pick a healthier protein bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="SWZZ3HQ3VZBQRNUFSNJ3AT4JOA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;High quality protein&lt;/b&gt;: Look for proteins such as egg whites and dairy, which may be listed as casein or whey protein. “These contain all the essential amino acids that your body can’t make and that you need for muscle growth,” Stephens said. If you’re vegan, look for plant proteins like soy and pea protein. “These are also great sources of protein,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;At least 10 grams of protein&lt;/b&gt;: Choose bars that have between 10 and 20 grams of protein. “That’s a decent amount,” Zumpano said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fiber&lt;/b&gt;: Eating fiber &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/09/17/secrets-to-successful-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;helps keep you full&lt;/a&gt; and satiated, and it nourishes your gut microbiome. Look for bars that have about 3 to 5 grams of fiber per serving, Zumpano said. But the more the better. “If a bar has more than 5 grams of fiber, that’s great,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole food ingredients&lt;/b&gt;: Choose bars that are made from “real food” ingredients such as oats, seeds, egg whites, dates, almonds and peanuts. “The ingredients should be things that you can pronounce and recognize,” Stephens said. “If you’re not really sure what an ingredient is, it’s likely something that’s highly processed and that might not be good for your health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BL7XOAKGHVEIXJEWBSFYG5EXXU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BL7XOAKGHVEIXJEWBSFYG5EXXU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The healthiest protein bars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHM4J7TXB5BKVJ5GSGY2QPKXT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://aloha.com/collections/" target="_blank"&gt;These bars&lt;/a&gt; are relatively low in sugar, high in fiber and have a good amount of protein. Most of the bars have 14 grams of protein and in some cases as much as 10 grams of fiber. That’s roughly a third of the recommended daily fiber intake for adults. The bars are made with mostly simple ingredients, such as almonds, rolled oats, brown rice protein, cashew butter and chocolate chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2NIXL6YHNHM5FIR7SOHATCZPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The ingredients are awesome, and the bars are plant-based,” Stephens said. They’re available in at least 21 flavors,  including almond butter cup, blueberry, chocolate caramel pecan, and chocolate chip cookie dough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMLBW2Y3VVCLLH4CV2XLXDLTP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.trubar.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoprIJf2ehASiwZ7cVYORz5YXs15YhZrkAPugUsFlYDwAo2-K97j" target="_blank"&gt;These bars&lt;/a&gt; contain 12 grams of protein and large amounts of fiber — up to 14 grams per bar, which is about half your recommended daily amount of fiber. They’re relatively low in added sugars compared to other bars, and they’re not artificially sweetened. They contain a blend of plant proteins along with such things as almonds, organic coconut and unsweetened chocolate, and tapioca fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AEWHZQJNARCOHOKAXVIGPYNZKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars.html" target="_blank"&gt;These protein bars&lt;/a&gt; are a favorite among dietitians because they’re made from just a handful of simple ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen,  such as dates, egg whites, nuts, coconut and other dried&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fruit. They contain 12 grams of protein, four to six grams of fiber, and 14 to 17 grams of sugar. While these bars are generally on the sweeter side, their sugar content comes from the dates and other dried fruits — not from table sugar, corn syrup or other added sugars. “These bars can be great in the afternoon for a quick snack,” Stephens said. “I like them because they have a moderate amount of protein and ingredients that you can recognize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PWKS55WZHFDKJMJV4CPMWDCKR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another good option are &lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/minis-variety-pack-1680840075.html" target="_blank"&gt;RXBAR Minis&lt;/a&gt;, which contain about half the calories and total sugar of the regular RXBARs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5VQKKC56PFGGVCL4FC554EPSWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://allrealnutrition.com/products/ultimate-pack" target="_blank"&gt;Each bar&lt;/a&gt; contains 12 or fewer ingredients, including grass-fed milk protein. They also have more protein — 16 grams — than a lot of other bars we analyzed. They’re high in fiber and contain little or no added sugar, and they’re made from real-food ingredients  such as peanuts, dates, almonds, cocoa, chicory fiber and coconut. They’re available in nine&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;flavors, and they come in plastic-free packaging, including compostable wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VY7DIK667RHULKMXTKV2XFSRMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/" target="_blank"&gt;These vegan protein bars&lt;/a&gt; contain a lot of nutritious whole-food ingredients, such as organic almond butter, organic rolled oats, organic sunflower seed butter, and a blend of organic plant proteins. They’re slightly sweeter than some other protein bars, with around 7 to 13 grams of added sugar per bar. But they also have a decent amount of protein (10 to 12 grams) and fiber (2 to 3 grams) per bar. They’re available in 15 flavors, and they’re gluten-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IMQ3WJLZ3VG4HPLKBY4NDP7XHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We recommend their &lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/white-chocolate-macadamia-nuts/" target="_blank"&gt;“Celestial Delight” protein bar&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with white chocolate and macadamia nuts. It has one of the best nutrition profiles of any GoMacro bar, with 12 grams of protein, 7 grams of added sugar and 2 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5DVYU7APTRDK5NBZFTHAXDJBXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The main ingredient in &lt;a href="https://88acres.com/collections/protein-bars" target="_blank"&gt;these bars&lt;/a&gt; is pumpkin seeds. But they contain a lot of other wholesome ingredients, including sunflower seeds, cherries, bananas, dark chocolate and cinnamon. Each bar has 12 grams of protein, and they come in a variety of flavors,  such as banana bread, dark chocolate brownie and chocolate chip blondie. They’re also allergy-friendly: They’re vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and made without wheat, soy, eggs and other top allergens, making them&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a good choice for people with food allergies and sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YWVZKHNWNVFVFDH4OFAF7YYGPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most protein bars are sweet.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But these Paleo-friendly &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bars" target="_blank"&gt;Epic bars&lt;/a&gt; are a good choice for people who want a savory option that’s not plant-based. They’re made from a handful of whole-food ingredients such as bison, pork, grass-fed beef and venison, along with a variety of spices and seasonings. They’re slightly lower in protein than other bars — ranging from about 7 to 13 grams of protein per bar — but they’re also fairly low in fat, sugar and calories, Stephens said. One caveat is that some of the flavors are high in sodium. We recommend the &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/bisonbaconcranberrybar" target="_blank"&gt;Bison Bacon Cranberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/beefaplebaconbar" target="_blank"&gt;Beef Uncured Bacon + Apple&lt;/a&gt; bars, which are among the flavors that are lowest in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WJVUXMNH7ZADFOLXS3DVPGQJLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some other good protein options from Epic are their “&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bites/products/salmon-maple-coconut-oil-bites" target="_blank"&gt;salmon bites&lt;/a&gt;” made from wild Alaskan salmon, and their “&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips" target="_blank"&gt;snack strips&lt;/a&gt;” made from &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/wagyu-beef-steak-strips" target="_blank"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/smoked-salmon-maple-fillet-strips" target="_blank"&gt;wild salmon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFRMWE2CYBFWBJFDHA3F6XO5KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Picky Bar company was founded by a group of professional endurance athletes. Their &lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars" target="_blank"&gt;protein bars&lt;/a&gt; contain a mixture of plant proteins, healthy fats and complex carbs thanks to such ingredients  as nut butters, dried fruit, oats and seeds.

And yes, in theory, those microorganisms can be spread to other eaters. But in most cases, that might not be as risky as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GTBHS6G4Y5HQZKRQYO6SZB47YI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers at Clemson University &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-4565.2008.00137.x" target="_blank"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that there were more bacteria in double-dipped situations compared with the single-dipped. In a series of experiments, the team analyzed how many bacteria were transferred from a bitten cracker into a cup of sterile water compared with an unbitten cracker. They found that if someone had taken a bite before dipping, the water contained significantly more bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KM225OHDHJBHLLQZYLT2GHN3BU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, the researchers reported that the type of food mattered.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywiv000193b77nf1w9hfo@published"&gt;I’ve been friends with, “Sarah,” for over a decade, but over the last year, I no longer enjoy spending time with her. We were at our closest when I had a lot of mental health issues and needed constant validation and support. I think she enjoyed being needed. After some good therapy, I no longer need this type of validation and feel uncomfortable with how much detail she expects to know about my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb71nqy600583b77wqqsqkxr@published"&gt;Without the minutiae of my life to talk about, we don’t seem to have much in common. Our conversation usually veers into talking about our other mutual friends, which also makes me uncomfortable since I know she is doing the same about me with them. I can’t help but feel guilty about “abandoning her now that I don’t need her,” but I feel stressed every time we hang out. I have been trying to slowly phase out the friendship by seeing her less, but she keeps hitting me up, and I feel weird completely ignoring her. Am I wrong to throw away a long friendship? Do I leave her on read, or should I explicitly ask for space? Without making plans to see each other, we would not run into each other for a long while.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask her if she’s still playing pickleball and if she likes it. Ask her if that one co-worker she mentioned still makes weird faces during Zoom meetings. Ask her if she can recommend any good true crime documentaries, what she thinks Beyoncé’s next album will be like, and whether she wants to come with you to return something to Sephora and help you choose a new foundation. Take the reins of the conversation and talk about things that don’t involve the details of your life or criticizing your friends, and see if you enjoy her more. She might have interesting things to say! And if your relationship has been mostly defined by her probing into your deepest, darkest feelings, it’s no wonder you haven’t heard them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywj3h001d3b77dyuwqisd@published"&gt;I’ve been in your shoes before, really dreading the conversations I had with a particular person. It was a revelation when it hit me that I didn’t just have to sit there and let them decide what we’d talk about. Instead, I could get ahead of their predictable and annoying content by shaping the exchange into something that I wanted to have. You might be pleased to realize, like I was, that your friend is not actually attached to the kinds of talks you normally have. Maybe she’s just operating out of habit, or doesn’t have any other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

You can pair this with thanking her for all the ways in which she’s been there for you and shown interest in your life. Tell her that while you want to take some space, you will still show up for her if she needs you.&lt;/p&gt;

She really fought to beat it, but it was just too much for her in the end. Going through that opened my eyes to how easy it is for disordered eating to get passed off as being “health-conscious.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy73001q3b7733mx3xyh@published"&gt;Now that I’m in my 30s, I’ve been seeing a lot of guys my age getting really obsessed with dieting and weight. Most of the time, I try to ignore it, but I’m getting worried about my friend “James.” A few years ago, he started this super strict diet, and it just seems to get more extreme over time. He talks about “toxins” a lot, and it feels like he’s always changing what he’s eating or doing, but never really explains why. I also see how he’s started working out differently. He’s way more focused on it than before—and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

It might ease your mind a bit to remind yourself that, unfortunately, a lot of people do experience disordered relationships with eating and exercise, and while it’s certainly very dangerous, it doesn’t always end in tragedy. But if your assessment of James’s escalating obsession with his diet and body is accurate, you’re still right to be concerned and to share that with him.&lt;/p&gt;

If so, I’m hopeful that he’d be understanding—even if he doesn’t change his behavior in response—about your concerns. The key here will be to be totally transparent, just like you were in your letter, explaining that you know it’s not your place to scrutinize his eating and exercise habits. Then explain that you have a heightened sensitivity to the way restrictive practices can spiral and have become worried about him. To avoid offending him or causing him to become defensive, you want to make sure to include the sentences, “I could be totally off base here,” “I hope this isn’t annoying,” and, “I just really care about you.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6ywy76001w3b77xl7krhd9@published"&gt;I have to warn you that he has this approach to diet and exercise for a reason, whether it’s a healthy one or an unhealthy one. Something about the restriction, the way his body looks, or the fantasy of the way his body will look if he tweaks just one more thing is likely making him feel the way he wants to feel right now, or helping him to avoid feelings he doesn’t want to experience. That’s a powerful force. Plus, diet culture is so widespread and normalized that even if he’s really overdoing it, he can easily tell himself he’s just taking care of his body. So your mini-intervention may not change his behavior. But one day in the future, it could be one of many things that inspires him to reevaluate what he’s doing. Plus, if this is bothering you, there’s something to be said for being honest and open with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s valuable even if he doesn’t immediately take a rest day and eat a carb.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6yxbnj00283b77vcb6oepn@published"&gt;Six years ago, my sister unexpectedly died. She left a large part of her estate to my two nephews and “Maya,” the daughter of her best friend, “Josie.” I have control over the trust, and it states that the money should be used for educational purposes. It isn’t a problem since my nephews are both college age, but Maya is still in elementary school. Tragically, Josie died last year. I went to the funeral but only had sporadic contact with the family until recently. Josie’s widower has been increasingly calling me about Maya’s money.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6yxbnj002a3b77kc1nhzsw@published"&gt;It has gone from plausible (paying for dance lessons) to impossible (her day camp will only accept cash, and he will give it to them). The last conversation had him threatening me. It left me very shaken, and I am wondering about what to do next. I love and miss my sister, but I was never close to Josie or Maya. I really don’t want to deal with this for the next decade. Is it wrong to just dump Maya’s portion in a 529 plan and be done with it? The trust allows me to.&lt;/p&gt;

But check in with a lawyer/financial planner about the trust to hammer out the details. I do worry that the 529 plan won’t provide you the foolproof relief from never interfacing with this man again that you’re seeking. You’ll want to ask a professional about what your options are for dealing with this difficult widower and safeguarding Maya’s money, while simultaneously giving yourself the peace of mind you want and &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My dad was devastated. About two years ago, Dad met a woman who’d also lost a partner and they started dating. They’ve made each other very happy, and my siblings and I have all been glad to see him doing well. We don’t know “Molly” very well, but she seems lovely. Dad sold the family home six months ago and moved in with her. He also revised his will. He’s 88, and Molly is 83. She has two kids, owns her home, and lives comfortably. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/_pages/cjm9soenr001k44kpzjusm1ac.html"&gt;Dad shared that he’s leaving one-third of his $200,000 estate to Molly, with the remaining two-thirds to be divided between us three children.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 64-year-old woman in Minneapolis, Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient visited a medical clinic to seek care for her &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1015/p500.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2017/1015/p500.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chronic rhinosinusitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — tissue inflammation in the sinuses and nasal passages — that was causing a viscous discharge containing mucus and pus to persistently drip down the back of her throat. She also reported headaches accompanying the postnasal drip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman told physicians at the clinic that 23 years earlier she underwent &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sinus-surgery" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/endoscopic-sinus-surgery" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endoscopic surgery for chronic sinus infections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which typically involves removing blockages from the sinuses with the help of a tube-shaped scope. But after the procedure, she continued to experience thick and discolored mucus, which was somewhat relieved by rinsing with antibiotics and saline. She continued this irrigation regimen for eight years, stopping two years before seeking help at the clinic. (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2833827" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2833827" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't note why she stopped the rinses.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors collected a mucus sample from one of the patient's sinus cavities for analysis. In addition, when they cleared out the accumulated mucus from her sinuses, they discovered something unexpected: bony lumps on the walls of the sinus cavities on either side of her nose. Their abundance in the woman's sinuses gave her sinus walls "a cobblestone appearance," the doctors wrote in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; A lab analysis of the mucus sample revealed that the woman had a bacterial infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, a bacterial species often found in healthcare settings that can be resistant to antibiotics. The cobblestone growths were "exostoses" — benign, bone tumors that often form as layers in ear canal tissue after repeated exposure to cold water. They are sometimes seen in a condition known as "surfer's ear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The doctors treated the woman's bacterial infection using sinus rinses with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentamicin-injection-route/description/drg-20074471" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/gentamicin-injection-route/description/drg-20074471" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gentamicin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful antibiotic, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/budesonide-nasal-route/description/drg-20074729" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/budesonide-nasal-route/description/drg-20074729" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;budesonide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a steroid that reduces inflammation. After the patient's symptoms subsided, she was switched to warm saline rinses and told to avoid cold water to prevent more bony lesions from developing. Her symptoms did not return, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors determined that the existing exostoses were not responsible for the woman's rhinosinusitis and were unlikely to cause future sinus problems. Therefore, the growths did not require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Since the 1930s, exostoses in the ear canal have been associated with surfing and other water activities that involve prolonged, repeated immersion in cold water. Researchers have hypothesized that these bony growths are a protective response of the ear canal's vascular tissue, which lacks a layer of insulating fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinus tissue also lacks a layer of fatty insulation, making it similarly vulnerable to the formation of bony growths. The patient's exostoses were likely caused by years of sinus irrigation with cold liquid, according to the report. While this development in the sinuses is rare compared to surfer's ear, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753257/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753257/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;several&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openneuroimagingjournal.com/VOLUME/6/PAGE/90/ABSTRACT/" target="_blank" data-url="https://openneuroimagingjournal.com/VOLUME/6/PAGE/90/ABSTRACT/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;other cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; involving exostoses in the sinus cavities have been described in the medical literature — and they usually involved repeated cold-water nasal rinses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6-RatgQ4RVZ2v3nP7I2JMW6kdQZ0v4dqBG" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-TpBGqjwqoEXxiSKSLLAvD6-RatgQ4RVZ2v3nP7I2JMW6kdQZ0v4dqBG slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A drop of blood dangled at its tip, not quite big enough to fall. I needed enough blood to fill a small circle outlined on a piece of paper. Taking a little sample at home had sounded simple when I had ordered this test kit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su53h00083b73eowgr9qp@published"&gt;“Everyone bleeds differently,” the man on my laptop screen said. I had booked a support call to make sure I did everything right. &lt;em&gt;Apparently I’m not good at bleeding&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. “You can use another finger,” the man added encouragingly. “That’s why there are four needles.” I clenched my teeth, aimed the flat triangular needle, and pricked again.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su56r00093b73chky4p7w@published"&gt;At last, after three pricked fingers, I managed to fill the paper outline with red. Staring down at the circle of hard-earned blood, I wondered: &lt;em&gt;How much plastic is in there?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su59n000a3b73d0dm31j5@published"&gt;All the effort was for a &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/microplastics-test?variant=49128651161885"&gt;microplastics blood test&lt;/a&gt;, the first designed to be taken at home. Testing human blood for microplastics is a relatively new thing. Until this home test came out, the process could be done only at scientific research labs, which is not exactly an accessible option for most people. Microplastics are tiny pieces that routinely shed off plastic things we use, like water bottles and synthetic clothing. Over time, they break down, occasionally becoming small enough to &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02317"&gt;test the limits&lt;/a&gt; of our measuring abilities. These microplastics are in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8520475/"&gt;air we breathe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9920460/"&gt;food we eat&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772224000640"&gt;water we drink&lt;/a&gt;. So they’re also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81931-9"&gt;in our blood&lt;/a&gt; and can even travel to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9953450/"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11342020/"&gt;other organs&lt;/a&gt;. “Basically, anywhere you look in the human body, you find them,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/Phil-Landrigan.html"&gt;Philip Landrigan&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and public health physician who has researched plastics and health. Perhaps you’ve heard about the study that found that the brain can contain &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness"&gt;as much plastic as there is in a disposable spoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5c7000b3b73xqefcabi@published"&gt;Perhaps you have also heard of &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/about"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the entrepreneur behind the test kit I was trying out, whose maxim is “&lt;a href="https://dontdie.bryanjohnson.com/"&gt;Don’t Die&lt;/a&gt;.” He’s famous for his attempts to reverse aging, including &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/23/bryan-johnson-tech-ceo-spends-2-million-year-young-swapping-blood-17-year-old-son-talmage-70-father/"&gt;injecting his son’s blood into his body&lt;/a&gt; and, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XypgGeD7gBk"&gt;more recently&lt;/a&gt;, removing all the plasma in his body to “replace it with very clean stuff.” The routine &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/blueprint-protocol"&gt;he shares online&lt;/a&gt; includes nearly 20 daily supplement pills. Through his company &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorfW2a1NsGvpn7nBjlbZXz6-BoMgzC873ZtlrFkGnbfhxsPyrey"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/a&gt;, he sells products based on his regimen, like the $150 microplastics test kit, to people who share his hopes of longevity. “As part of my protocol, I began testing everything that was going into my body: food, water, air and everything else,” Johnson shared in an email. “I learned through testing that we are surrounded by toxins.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5eq000c3b73ognyp6dk@published"&gt;Johnson routinely measures everything from his &lt;a href="https://mitohealth.com/blog/the-11-biomarkers-bryan-johnson-tracks-to-live-longer#:~:text=%F0%9F%93%89%20Ideal%3A%20%3C%205.2,cancer%2C%20and%20dementia"&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/i-have-the-world-s-slowest-speed-of-aging?"&gt;his DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-methylation"&gt;natural genetic change&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00462-6"&gt;estimate the pace of aging&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests that everyone else get tested too (though I doubt many will compete with his claim of being “&lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/pages/about#blueprint-bryan"&gt;the most biologically measured person in history&lt;/a&gt;”). But even as microplastics were becoming a familiar health concern, there was no test on the market for regular consumers. Johnson decided to change that. “A lot of people want to measure their levels of microplastics and it’s never been possible. Things that get measured, improve,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5he000d3b73q9g1iyvf@published"&gt;Having microplastics in the human body does not sound good. To better understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this isn’t good, I called up Heather Leslie. She’s a scientist &lt;a href="https://www.heather-leslie.com/"&gt;who does consulting&lt;/a&gt; on environmental and health issues, and she’s an expert on blood-borne plastic specifically. In 2022 she led the research team that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258"&gt;found microplastics in human blood&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. Microplastics were first observed in humans &lt;a href="https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/about-us/news/detailsite/2018/news-october-2018/microplastics-detected-in-humans-for-the-first-time/"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when researchers at the Medical University of Vienna detected them in the digestive system. After that study came out, Leslie felt it was important to check the bloodstream. Finding plastic circulating there proved that it was actually absorbed by our bodies, rather than something that simply passed through us. Since then, microplastics have shot into our collective health consciousness—and knowing that we can absorb them has motivated some, myself included, to cut down on plastic use. I’ve filled my kitchen with Pyrex instead of Tupperware. I quit reusing Ziploc bags. I check clothing labels, looking for natural fibers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5k2000e3b739hw74936@published"&gt;But when, a month after I’d mailed in the bloodstained paper, my microplastics test results arrived, those small efforts suddenly felt meaningless. I had to set up an account on Johnson’s Don’t Die app to view the results. Although the process was simple, it gave me time to become slightly apprehensive and to hope for a low microplastics count. Instead, my small circle of blood had 39—&lt;em&gt;39!&lt;/em&gt;—pieces of plastic in it. I had more microplastics than 77 percent of people who had taken the same test. I suspected there were even more pieces floating around in my sample, too small for this test to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5nj000f3b737dis41cq@published"&gt;Those little bits of plastic could’ve come from anywhere, really. I apply lipstick from plastic tubes. I buy plastic-wrapped fruit from the grocery store. Even my water filter, designed to remove harmful chemicals, is made of plastic. Although I know plastic is a problem, something still feels friendly about the bright-colored toothpaste tube, the crinkly bag of pasta. That’s the result of a life lived among successful ad campaigns, I guess. But putting a number to the microplastics in my blood had me starting to rethink. Suddenly, pollution felt personal. Was it time to stop buying plastic altogether?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5qr000g3b73jhhgdunf@published"&gt;Just how microplastics affect us from the inside, and to what extent they do, is actually largely unknown. Leslie says plastic is “like spaghetti with a sauce.” The pieces of plastic are the spaghetti, and the chemicals attached to it are the sauce. Those chemical additives are what give plastic different properties, like color, stretchiness, and flame resistance. Sometimes, the chemical “sauce” leaches out of plastic, a process that, research has shown, &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/chemicals-plastics-technical-report"&gt;can be toxic&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to the “spaghetti,” though, scientists don’t yet know how it affects our bodies. Microplastics could transport those harmful chemicals into humans. Then again, there are lots of ways for plastic chemicals to get inside us. (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723021527#sec5"&gt;They’re common pollutants&lt;/a&gt; on their own.) It’s difficult to determine whether certain chemicals in our bodies come from microplastics or are features of our environment. And the effects of the microplastics themselves remain unclear. Although some researchers suspect they can cause damage by physically disrupting tissues and cells, it’ll take more investigating to definitively assess their health effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="205" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5te000h3b73edyu0wzp@published"&gt;Even just getting an accurate measurement of microplastic pieces in the blood is difficult. “If you don’t use a really strong, robust, reliable, repeatable method—reproducible, all these things—then you are going to get a number out at the other end, but it might just be sort of a mythological number,” Leslie told me. Blueprint’s lab partner &lt;a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/products/microplastics-test?variant=49128651161885#:~:text=Our%20lab%20partner%20developed%20a%20plastic%2Dfree%20Fluorescent%20Microscopy%20(FM)%20methodology%20using%20only%20glass%2C%20metal%2C%20or%20paper%20to%20avoid%20contamination."&gt;uses a plastic-free method&lt;/a&gt; to test the blood for plastic so that it’s not contaminated during testing. But there’s no way to know whether a sample got contaminated before arriving at the testing location. Leslie notes that scientists usually use a “field blank” for lab tests: an additional sample to show whether the sampling process caused contamination. The home test’s small, single sample doesn’t allow for this safeguard. And it’s all too easy to accidentally taint a drop of blood at home. Even the alcohol wipe I cleaned my finger with could be a source of plastic if the alcohol were ever stored in a plastic container. There’s also the chance I didn’t sanitize my hands correctly. So, for all my effort to get that drop of blood out of my finger, it might not have given me a truly accurate scientific read on how much plastic I contain.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su5w3000i3b73gru77ku4@published"&gt;Overall, Leslie believes I shouldn’t draw health-related conclusions from the test. “For an individual result, a one-off measurement like this, we can’t really say anything about how you should be feeling today or if this is going to lead to a chronic disease.” Also, there’s no proven way to get rid of the plastics inside us. (Some experimental methods, like the &lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1884313232946651413"&gt;plasma replacement&lt;/a&gt; Johnson has tried, were listed at the end of my test results—but their effectiveness remains uncertain.) “I don’t know of any way to get them out of the human body,” said Landrigan. “It’s nice that somebody’s got a test, but one of the things that we’ve all learned in medicine is you don’t test for stuff that you can’t fix.” Landrigan notes that it is wise to reduce plastic use, as much as you can. “But I can tell you that anyway,” he said. “I don’t need to find microplastic particles in your blood to offer you that advice.”&lt;/p&gt;

(The results also came with tips for reducing exposure.) I found a cotton cover for my synthetic mattress. I’m on the lookout for natural fiber sponges. Yet … I’ve noticed that even these nonplastic products are often sold in plastic packaging. I’ve also realized that I’m not ready for the expense and effort of an extremely plastic-free lifestyle. While I aspire to buy only fresh, unbagged produce and to replace all my synthetic clothes, the fact is that those alternatives are pricey, and avoiding anything with plastic in it is simply out of my budget.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmb6su618000k3b73lyr0afch@published"&gt;And even if I never so much as touched plastic again, I’d still be breathing, eating, and drinking countless bits of it too small to see. In a plastic-obsessed society, reducing exposure is only getting harder. In the past 15 years, the world has produced half of the plastic ever made, and production is still speeding up. A global plastics treaty &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/un-sets-date-extra-session-finalize-plastics-treaty-2025-03-03/"&gt;is being negotiated&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear if it’ll lead to meaningful action to reduce the plastic in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it’s the perfect anecdote to share the next time I’m at a party, holding a plastic &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;cup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Scientists in Europe have tested an anti-aging drug cocktail in mice and found that it extended the animals' lifespans by around 30 percent. The mice stayed healthier for longer too, with less chronic inflammation and delayed  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="162916" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The two drugs are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus"&gt;rapamycin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trametinib"&gt;trametinib&lt;/a&gt;, which are both used to treat different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-successfully-turn-breast-cancer-cells-into-fat-to-stop-them-from-spreading"&gt;types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Rapamycin is also often used to prevent organ rejection, and has shown promise in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-cocktail-yields-greatest-lifespan-extension-ever-seen-animals-anti-ageing-mechanisms-nematodes"&gt;extending lifespans&lt;/a&gt; in animal tests. Trametinib, meanwhile, has been shown to extend the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.023"&gt;lifespan of fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;, but whether that worked in larger animals remained to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;So for a new study, a research team led by scientists from the Max Planck Institute in Germany investigated how both drugs, on their own and together, could extend lifespan in mice.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;True to its reputation, rapamycin alone was found to extend the lifespan of mice by 17 to 18 percent. Trametinib wasn't too bad either, boosting longevity by 7 to 16 percent. But when their powers combined, treated mice saw a significant lifespan extension of around 26 to 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162923" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-642x428.jpg" alt="Anti-Aging Cocktail Extends Mouse Lifespan by About 30 Percent" class="wp-image-162923 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/2025_RapamycinTrametinib_2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162923" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The combination of rapamycin and trametinib could work to extend lifespan. (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1075141?"&gt;K. Link/Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The extra time added to the animals' lifespans weren't merely offset by frailty and illness, though. The combo treatment delayed the growth of liver and spleen tumors in the mice, and reduced age-related inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen, and muscle. The animals seemed to be more active at advanced ages compared to control mice, with reduced body weight and a slower decline in heart function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;As intriguing as the results are, we shouldn't expect to be able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rapamycin-mtor-inhibitors-human-trial-boosts-immunity-elderly"&gt;pop some pills&lt;/a&gt; and live to 130. Instead, the most promising aspect for human applications might be in improving the quality of our twilight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;"While we do not expect a similar extension to human lifespans as we found in mice, we hope that the drugs we're investigating could help people to stay healthy and disease-free for longer late in life," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085316"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Linda Partridge, co-senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;"Further research in humans in years to come will help us to elucidate how these drugs may be useful to people, and who might be able to benefit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;To test the drugs, the researchers fed hundreds of mice regular doses of rapamycin, trametinib, or both from six months of age, and measured their survival for the rest of their lives. While benefits were seen from either drug alone, the best outcomes came from the combined treatment.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Median lifespans were increased by 34.9 percent in female mice and 27.4 percent in males, while maximum lifespans increased by 32.4 percent in females and 26.1 percent in males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The team says that the benefits of the drug combo don't seem to be simply down to a higher dose. Although both drugs act on the same signaling pathway – known as the Ras/Insulin/TOR network – they target different points. When the researchers analyzed gene expression, they found certain changes only occur when both drugs are given.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Importantly, no extra side effects were seen from combining the drugs, outside of those already known for each alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Human trials for the drug combo could begin relatively soon. Both drugs are already approved for use in humans in the US and European Union, with anti-aging benefits hinted at in previous studies. Rapamycin, for example, seemed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-may-extend-womens-fertility-by-years-early-results-show"&gt;extend the fertility&lt;/a&gt; of perimenopausal women by up to five years in one recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00876-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The procedure is currently offered for thousands of dollars a session at many &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/well/longevity-health-clinics.html" title=""&gt;longevity clinics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In a car, “you change the oil every 3,000 miles because it clears out debris," said Dr. Eric Verdin, the president and chief executive of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. Your blood, he said, can also accumulate potentially damaging particles that can be flushed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70103" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;first trials&lt;/a&gt; examining plasma exchange for anti-aging in humans, published Tuesday in the journal Aging Cell, offers early evidence that it may be able to slow the biological breakdown that comes with age, even in otherwise healthy people. The small study of 42 participants, with an average age of 65, found that those who got plasma exchange therapy over the course of a few months had lower concentrations in their blood of the biological compounds that accumulate with age, compared with a control group. The trial was sponsored by Circulate Health, a plasma exchange startup, and coauthored by Dr. Verdin, a company co-founder and head of the scientific advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, many other scientists who study plasma exchange are skeptical. Its anti-aging benefits for healthy people have “never been proven" in large clinical trials, said Dr. Katayoun Fomani, an associate professor and medical director of the blood bank at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and drawing blood and replacing plasma with added fluids could put patients at risk for unnecessary medical complications without a clear payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-4b4401f4"&gt;How does the procedure work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Plasma exchange is a well-established treatment for certain blood disorders, autoimmune diseases and neurological conditions, and it’s typically covered by insurance when deemed medically necessary. It is not covered for anti-aging purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;During the therapy, a provider — typically a registered nurse or a technician — hooks the patient up to a machine that draws out blood. The machine separates and discards the plasma from the blood, replaces it with donor plasma or a substitute fluid, then returns the blood back to the patient. The substitute fluid often contains a mixture of saline and proteins, like albumin; in some cases, an infusion of antibodies or drugs may also be added to boost the immune system or fight certain diseases.

Kennedy Jr.’s unilateral decision that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;would no longer recommend Covid-19 boosters&lt;/a&gt; for healthy people during childhood or pregnancy represents a bulldozing of safeguards intended to keep public health officials honest and their decisions transparent. It also tramples on individuals’ ability to make their own decisions about medical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision is deeply and maddeningly ironic, because Kennedy and other top figures in the Department of Health and Human Services are shaped by grievances about how their predecessors behaved during the Covid pandemic. At the time, they railed against decisions that they said were made without medical evidence or the consultation of important experts. Yet Tuesday’s decision to change the CDC vaccine recommendations, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/"&gt;new policy made last week&lt;/a&gt; about the way Covid shots would be regulated, takes these mistakes and amplifies them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of slowing medicine’s pendulum so that it might eventually stop at a point of truth, Kennedy, the health secretary, is now swinging it so wildly that patients and doctors can do nothing but cover their heads and duck as medicine becomes more and more vulnerable to politicized extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As we enter the colder months in Australia, COVID is &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; designated NB.1.8.1 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you need to know about this new variant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The current COVID situation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than five years since COVID was initially declared a pandemic, we’re still experiencing regular waves of infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/news-data/covid-statistics/"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt; suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAIN-Aust-COVID-19-Stats-worksheet-2025.xlsx-18.pdf"&gt;ticking upwards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;among the circulating strains&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250517.pdf"&gt;generally increasing&lt;/a&gt;. Of cases sequenced &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;up to May 6&lt;/a&gt; across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia &lt;a href="https://www.health.wa.gov.au/articles/a_e/coronavirus/covid19-wastewater-surveillance"&gt;has determined NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;collected in Perth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;late April 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences – up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia – it was the dominant variant in &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md"&gt;Hong Kong and China&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Lara Herrero, created using BioRender&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where does this variant come from?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;collected in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-hybrid-covid-strain-behind-vietnams-latest-wave-not-exactly-161879"&gt;Recombinant&lt;/a&gt;” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image to the right shows more specifically how NB.1.8.1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170225000395"&gt;came about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;a suite of mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us – specifically via the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"&gt;ACE2 receptors&lt;/a&gt;, a “doorway” to our cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;mutations include&lt;/a&gt; T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It’s early days for this variant, so we don’t have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested – suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1922810251503362351"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;LP.8.1.1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it’s possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-in-cases-recently-symptoms-associated-with-it/photostory/121373694.cms"&gt;symptoms of NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;COVID is continuing to evolve.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/coronavirus-2019ncov-virus-background-disease-cells-1712110216"&gt;Joannii/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How about the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia’s winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated COVID boosters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if neutralising antibody levels &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;are modestly reduced&lt;/a&gt; against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current COVID vaccines should still &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;protect against severe disease&lt;/a&gt; with this variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;targets JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another COVID booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;if you’re eligible&lt;/a&gt;. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, COVID can still be a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;

health officials announced last week that pertussis - perhaps better known as whooping cough - is on the rise in the popular tourist hotspot at a 'worrying rate,' &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/hi/hawaii/news/2025/05/22/whooping-cough-cases-increase-in-hawaii"&gt;according to Spectrum Local News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of May 15, the state had already recorded 108 cases this year - surpassing last year's total cases of 84, the State of Hawaii Department of Health reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It called whooping cough a 'highly contagious respiratory disease' that spreads from bacteria through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, the symptoms can resemble a cold - but they can quickly progress to 'intense coughing fits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, those fits could be followed by a 'deep breath' that makes a 'whooping sound' due to clogged airways that are not fully formed,&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/american-honeymoon-hotspot-hit-highly-contagious-illness-health-officials-warn"&gt; Fox News reports. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Complications from the disease 'can be serious and even life-threatening, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated,' health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those complications can include pneumonia, seizures, apnea, encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) - and even possibly death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pertussis - perhaps better known as whooping cough - is on the rise in one American state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of May 15, Hawaii  had already recorded 108 cases this year  - surpassing last year's total cases of 84&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Pertussis is insidious and can be easily mistaken for other respiratory diseases - including viruses,' Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel warned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that whooping cough - which is a bacterial infection - can be treated with routine antibiotics but it is 'easily missed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best protection is vaccination, including repeated boosters in teens and adults,' Siegel suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DTaP (diptheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine is administered to children under the age of seven, while the Tdap (tetanus, diptheria and pertussis) vaccine is available for older children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neha Pathak, WebMD chief physician editor, told Fox News that about 98 out of 100 children who get the DTaP vaccine are protected from the diseases for at least one year after a fifth dose and about 70 percent are still protected up to five years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also said she suggests pregnant woman get the Tdap jab during their third trimester to pass antibodies onto their newborns who are too young to get the DTaP vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawaii health officials called whooping cough a 'highly contagious respiratory disease' that spreads from bacteria through the air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Siegel further claimed that DTaP is 'highly effective' in children with nearly 100 percent protection with appropriate dosages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, multiple doses are also generally recommended for infants, children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in Hawaii, health officials say vaccination rates 'for all routinely-recommended vaccinations for school entry - including those for measles, pertussis, polio and varicella (chicken pox)' have declined since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its vaccination levels are now even below the national average, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/22/whooping-cough-cases-surge-hawaii/"&gt;according to Hawaii News Now. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The uptick in pertussis cases is concerning, but not surprising given what we are seeing with vaccine hesitancy,' Pathak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors say the best way to prevent pertussis is by getting routine vaccinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, the rise in pertussis cases in Hawaii comes as experts warn &lt;span&gt;America is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7109605/US-measles-caseload-surpasses-1-000-health-officials-announce.html"&gt;poised for a measles explosion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; if vaccine rates continue to fall at their current pace. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research from Stanford University estimates that just a five percent decline in coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) would lead to an estimated 5.7 million measles cases and at least 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's the equivalent of 228,000 cases and 320 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in a devastating scenario, a 50 percent decline in vaccinations could flood the country with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691635/Americas-measles-outbreak-reaches-terrifying-milestone-96-infected-common.html"&gt;the life-threatening disease&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to 51 million cases, including 10.3 million hospitalizations and between 151,200 and 164,700 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For context, the US has confirmed 5,567 measles cases over the past 25 years, averaging 223 per year. In 2019 alone, there were nearly 1,300 cases; in 2020, just 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If rates stay where they are, the US could &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7403205/There-reasonable-chance-lose-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;lose its measles elimination status within two decades.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Stanford research projects that if vaccinations dip by just five percent, the case count of measles could jump to 5.7 million with 2,550 deaths over the next 25 years. In the worst-case scenario, if vaccination coverage were to plummet by 50 percent, cases could exceed 51 million with between 150,000 and 164,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US&lt;span&gt; is facing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, centered in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;Gaines and Lubbock counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, West Texas, where just 74 percent and 92 percent of children are vaccinated, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas has confirmed 728 measles cases so far, with over 400 in Gaines County alone. Two children in Texas and one in New Mexico have died. New Mexico has reported 71 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii also confirmed two cases in April, but health officials since concluded there was no further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, health officials in the Aloha State warn they are not out of the woods on that yet, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles cases in the United States continue to rise, with more than 1,000 cases already reported across 30 states this year,' they said in the news release last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risk remains high for future travel-related measles cases reaching Hawaii and DOH recommends continued vigilance efforts to increase the MMR vaccination rate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It then stressed its 'strong' recommendation for children and adults to stay up-to-date on all vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 05:37:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSU5oUVBRRUhtUG9DdXJ2VTE1dVRfRUc1OWo5V2xlcHZFanZzTmI4UGNYeWRuaU0wSEdCQVNqMHRCZk4tT0dLeGt0SmlER0x2MU5QUUNJUHl3SUdMTVJ4b0VsTm1jZVVaUEtqbmVJM2d1UXE3cWpBcTdoVm16Umc2VkpzODk4MEZqc2hfYmZpaTM2MWVLcVN3LW5ZSzRlS24taV930gGoAUFVX3lxTE5KTFdnWTI1QWhrVUViRE5UdFplUEpGcUZ2R0FGU3pkU2JUZG9QY3R1S3FWVkdFY1Y0RlB1MDlFdmw4bUFSMnZldmdLVlZpYktGaU5rQWtxZnZoSjN5Q1dqTTZsb0kzM3pzbkpmcTFzTzdjanc3cWQxa1BLZmhKQWc5SjJXRkJuOWVIOXVPUlUtaUxYTnh5TTNkN2liNlpnTjFDR1JXN2xlVQ</guid></item><item><title>我归咎于压力的早期预警迹象，实际上是我40多岁的早发性阿尔茨海默氏症-每日邮报 | Early warning signs I blamed on stress that were actually early-onset Alzheimer's in my forties - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOa25lUVNRTUdrRUlOU2tBMFkydlJOdFFFbEwxem44ZXBOZi12cndFeUI2Tl9sT2FGQUhQWXlock5JTnF0Zm5FZDB6cW9vTjhna20zSFVpNUlkeTdHWnBITjZ2TzVyLW1HaEFERzc5US1tRmVteUZZaDBqYWhra0NoUjU4MUJ1ZTY3QVlFSjk0R0x4eW1Db2JaTTV3SXNqeG1rQWE1aTBtdlVSa3Z2dUQ5blgxMmNHekJ1TzlXem5PRERRTTNOVWJxNFVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca Luna says she can't remember the previous day ‘seven to eight times out of 10.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She occasionally blacks out in the middle of conversations with friends: 'It's almost like I'm not there, it's black, and it feels blank. It's a complete nothingness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she comes to, she doesn't know what she's just said or done. The mother-of -two has also forgotten to turn the stove off and unknowingly started her car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lapses are all part of Luna's rare diagnosis: &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14485077/man-alzheimers-symptom-subtle-disease-early-onset.html"&gt;early-onset Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms began two years ago, and she started seeing psychiatrists for her memory ‘blips’, which Luna first chalked up to perimenopause or her &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-d8efc380-3b11-11f0-9bce-2b2fdcade45d"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. Luna also suffered from alcoholism for years - she is now 15 years sober - and feared her lapses could be repercussions of her addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t until a neurologist administered a two-hour cognitive test, which she failed, and took detailed MRI scans, that she learned the truth nine months ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Canadian native has grappled with the knowledge that the neurodegenerative disease will rob her of time with her children and has had to explain to them that, given her diagnosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;the mother they know her as will likely begin to disappear&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is more progressive, with a shorter life expectancy of about eight years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Luna's early-onset Alzheimer's symptoms appeared about two years ago. She would black out mid-conversation, lose her keys only to find them in her car's ignition, forget what she did the day before, and left to stove on at home for an hour before returning to find her kitchen full of smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wheredidrebeccago/video/7492897462038842629"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘It’s really hard to think about that stuff because I am in denial. So when my brain is like, let’s look at the facts, sometimes I look at my neurology documentation with all the scientific facts – they’re not just out of nowhere, they’re not perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have to look at that stuff to make it real for myself because I just love gaslighting myself… It is a progressive illness. We’re catching it super early, which is amazing, but there is no cure.’  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna had noticed a growing number of troubling instances over around two years in which she couldn’t remember doing basic, everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, she returned to her car in the gym parking lot and realized she couldn’t find her keys. She checked around and underneath the car and even looked on the roof, thinking she had left them there like she'd done in the past with her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, she realized: the car was running, and the keys were in the ignition. She had already gotten in the car and turned it on but it didn't register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My car was on that whole time.

Doctors also check for memory, language, and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She failed all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months ago, when she went to a neurologist for specialized care to confirm what the tests had found, she underwent a more expansive series of tests assessing her memory, attention, language, reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each test in the neurological evaluation has its own scoring system based on what is normal for a person's age beyond just looking at whether the patient scored high or low on a test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end, the doctor reviews all of the individual test scores to spot certain patterns, such as an usually low memory score with normal attention and language skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps the doctor spot signs their patient is dealing with Alzheimer's specifically, the type of dementia whose first symptom is memory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna said: ‘Then he looked at my MRIs, looked at other things noted by the psychiatrist, and he just walked in with pamphlets of early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There was no diagnosis at that time. This was his suspicion.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing, including her medial temporal atrophy (MTA) score, which is a diagnostic tool for dementia, led to a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly 7million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s is not typical Alzheimer’s disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it’s passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to administering lengthy cognitive tests, Luna's doctor took scans of her brain to document the shrinkage that had occured until then. This is not Luna's scan, but demonstrates what brain atrophy looks like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While early-onset Alzheimer's if often hereditary, Luna did not say whether she has a family history of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people with early-onset Alzheimer's often go about 1.6 years longer before getting diagnosed than those with late-onset Alzheimer's, likely because symptoms are missed or doctors take more time to evaluate younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis, Luna's family, including her daughter and mother, is in denial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘About two months ago, I sent her [my mother] the [doctor’s] clinical notes where he's put Alzheimer's on it. And she lost it then because I think she wasn't believing it until she saw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so weird. I make fun of it all the time because that's just generally who I am. I like to keep things kind of light and funny. It's important for me to make fun of myself, to keep the morale high for the people around me, but I also need it because it is so serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could totally take this and just go on an isolation/depression bender, and I do not want to do that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna began a TikTok account where she updates her 29,000 followers about her symptoms, her daily life, and her tips for self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia will rise sharply from 6.7 million in 2023 to 12.7 million by 2050, driven largely by the aging baby boomer generation, who face a higher risk of the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has found a community on the site and many helpful tips from people in the comments section enduring similar diagnoses or helping a loved one cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the best she has heard and implemented is minimizing clutter in her home, making playlists of songs that bring her back to herself, and journaling during the day, ‘because what's one of my new things is I shower and then two hours later I feel like I need to have a shower.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘If you are a loved one [of someone with Alzheimer’s], my suggestion is to meet them where they're at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What I've found really helpful with my partner is not to be questioned but reminded, and to just believe them.

It's a complete nothingness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she comes to, she doesn't know what she's just said or done. The mother-of -two has also forgotten to turn the stove off and unknowingly started her car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lapses are all part of Luna's rare diagnosis: &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14485077/man-alzheimers-symptom-subtle-disease-early-onset.html"&gt;early-onset Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms began two years ago, and she started seeing psychiatrists for her memory ‘blips’, which Luna first chalked up to perimenopause or her &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-d8efc380-3b11-11f0-9bce-2b2fdcade45d"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. Luna also suffered from alcoholism for years - she is now 15 years sober - and feared her lapses could be repercussions of her addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t until a neurologist administered a two-hour cognitive test, which she failed, and took detailed MRI scans, that she learned the truth nine months ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Canadian native has grappled with the knowledge that the neurodegenerative disease will rob her of time with her children and has had to explain to them that, given her diagnosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;the mother they know her as will likely begin to disappear&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is more progressive, with a shorter life expectancy of about eight years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Luna's early-onset Alzheimer's symptoms appeared about two years ago. She would black out mid-conversation, lose her keys only to find them in her car's ignition, forget what she did the day before, and left to stove on at home for an hour before returning to find her kitchen full of smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wheredidrebeccago/video/7492897462038842629"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘It’s really hard to think about that stuff because I am in denial. So when my brain is like, let’s look at the facts, sometimes I look at my neurology documentation with all the scientific facts – they’re not just out of nowhere, they’re not perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have to look at that stuff to make it real for myself because I just love gaslighting myself… It is a progressive illness. We’re catching it super early, which is amazing, but there is no cure.’  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna had noticed a growing number of troubling instances over around two years in which she couldn’t remember doing basic, everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, she returned to her car in the gym parking lot and realized she couldn’t find her keys. She checked around and underneath the car and even looked on the roof, thinking she had left them there like she'd done in the past with her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, she realized: the car was running, and the keys were in the ignition. She had already gotten in the car and turned it on but it didn't register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My car was on that whole time. I had completely blanked out the process of getting in, putting the key in, and turning the ignition on,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/i-have-early-onset-alzheimers-im-48-100001051.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIKzB4JHK31GEmdl2AXQxqYvK341rLNj2mOtC4uHs-KMPi5YsaLoJUJLgFmaDiGyC44CxjrDxvt1pOCIwvvIqh3VKza90FqXZu3YXMPToGoAksbqW_eFQHbNKu72aGah9E2MoBl6-1BlaH_cRDNjDKvzCI__Od9fgY-C7uJLa32J"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another time, she began boiling an egg on the stove, forgot about it, and left home for about half hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she eventually realized what she had done, she ran home to find her kitchen filled with smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using Framingham Heart Study data through 2009, researchers estimated that at age 45, the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s dementia was about 20 percent for women and 10 percnet for men, with slightly higher risks at age 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So, it literally almost caught my house on fire,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna's psychiatrist administered several cognitive tests, which ask people to recall words, name objects, follow simple instructions, or draw shapes. Doctors also check for memory, language, and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She failed all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months ago, when she went to a neurologist for specialized care to confirm what the tests had found, she underwent a more expansive series of tests assessing her memory, attention, language, reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each test in the neurological evaluation has its own scoring system based on what is normal for a person's age beyond just looking at whether the patient scored high or low on a test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end, the doctor reviews all of the individual test scores to spot certain patterns, such as an usually low memory score with normal attention and language skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps the doctor spot signs their patient is dealing with Alzheimer's specifically, the type of dementia whose first symptom is memory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna said: ‘Then he looked at my MRIs, looked at other things noted by the psychiatrist, and he just walked in with pamphlets of early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There was no diagnosis at that time. This was his suspicion.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing, including her medial temporal atrophy (MTA) score, which is a diagnostic tool for dementia, led to a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly 7million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s is not typical Alzheimer’s disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it’s passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to administering lengthy cognitive tests, Luna's doctor took scans of her brain to document the shrinkage that had occured until then. This is not Luna's scan, but demonstrates what brain atrophy looks like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While early-onset Alzheimer's if often hereditary, Luna did not say whether she has a family history of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people with early-onset Alzheimer's often go about 1.6 years longer before getting diagnosed than those with late-onset Alzheimer's, likely because symptoms are missed or doctors take more time to evaluate younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis, Luna's family, including her daughter and mother, is in denial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘About two months ago, I sent her [my mother] the [doctor’s] clinical notes where he's put Alzheimer's on it. And she lost it then because I think she wasn't believing it until she saw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so weird. I make fun of it all the time because that's just generally who I am. I like to keep things kind of light and funny. It's important for me to make fun of myself, to keep the morale high for the people around me, but I also need it because it is so serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could totally take this and just go on an isolation/depression bender, and I do not want to do that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna began a TikTok account where she updates her 29,000 followers about her symptoms, her daily life, and her tips for self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia will rise sharply from 6.7 million in 2023 to 12.7 million by 2050, driven largely by the aging baby boomer generation, who face a higher risk of the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has found a community on the site and many helpful tips from people in the comments section enduring similar diagnoses or helping a loved one cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the best she has heard and implemented is minimizing clutter in her home, making playlists of songs that bring her back to herself, and journaling during the day, ‘because what's one of my new things is I shower and then two hours later I feel like I need to have a shower.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘If you are a loved one [of someone with Alzheimer’s], my suggestion is to meet them where they're at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What I've found really helpful with my partner is not to be questioned but reminded, and to just believe them. And give them a hug. Tell them you love them. Because really, if I'm being completely honest, what I need is a hug from my family.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"Over time, this fat can lead to the formation of scar tissue, which is known as stage 1 fibrosis," she adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the disease progresses, the damage deepens. "With more and more scar tissue forming, the liver becomes harder, this is stage 3 &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-target-for-treating-heart-failure-study-101726467425404.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fibrosis"&gt;fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Wendi continues. She points out that at this point, the damage can begin to affect liver function more seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risk of irreversible damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, if left unchecked, the scar tissue can become irreversible.

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt about it — walking is a seriously underrated way to boost your fitness. It’s free, it’s low-impact, and it’s accessible to almost everyone. That said, as someone who walks every single day for her physical and mental health, I know that sometimes, it can get a little dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here on the Tom’s Guide fitness desk, we love a walking challenge. You can read what happened when I recently tried this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked"&gt;Japanese walking method&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/fart-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/fart-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;everything you need to know about ‘fart walking’&lt;/a&gt;, as well as what happened when our Fitness Editor Sam Hopes tried &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt;. Next on my list? The 5-4-5 walking technique. Read on to find out how to do it, and how I found it after giving it a go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-5-4-5-walking-technique-3"&gt;What is the 5-4-5 walking technique? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Japanese Interval Method of walking, the 5-4-5 walking technique involves changing the pace of your movement to raise and lower your heart rate, similar to HIIT training. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer and get warmed up — this could be walking for ten minutes at a reasonable intensity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run or jog for five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walk for four minutes at a relaxed walking pace, think an effort of 4 or 5 out of ten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speed up your walk so you’re walking at a brisk pace for five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the 14 minute circuit as many times as you want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed to be lower-impact than just running, this is designed to boost your heart rate, then let it recover, before elevating it slightly again. If you repeat the circuit twice through, you’ll have a 28-minute workout. Do it three times and you’ll have run/walked for 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you’ll be running for five minutes, it’s a good idea to set out with a pair of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes"&gt;best running shoes&lt;/a&gt; on your feet. These don’t have to be expensive, but you’ll need a comfortable, supportive pair of sneakers, rather than a set of hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-3"&gt;What are the benefits? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this workout moves between high, low, and medium intensity, you’ll burn more calories than if you were walking at a steady pace for the same amount of time. The running element of the workout will boost your heart rate and metabolism, followed by a four minute walk to aid recovery, then a brisk walk to work on your cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll work on your endurance and stamina during this workout, and it’s gentler on the joints than heading out for a non-stop run. If you’re a complete beginner, looking to build up to running your first 5K, this is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-RyyPtPMZkNya2Szm5zQJhK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-RyyPtPMZkNya2Szm5zQJhK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This workout is generally safe for most people, as it only involves short amounts of running, but if you’re recovering from an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to speak to a doctor beforehand. If you are new to running, remember that this isn’t a sprint — you should still be able to hold a conversation with someone running next to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-tried-the-5-4-5-walking-technique-for-a-week-and-i-m-hooked-3"&gt;I tried the 5-4-5 walking technique for a week — and I’m hooked &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened when I added the 5-4-5 walking technique to my routine for a week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-loved-the-variety"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I loved the variety &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll caveat this by saying I’m a marathon runner, so I’m very used to the running element of this workout. For the first day of this challenge, I opted to do two sets of the workout, and I immediately enjoyed the gentler start to my day than my usual run. I’m a year postpartum, but have built back up to running five miles three mornings a week, but I’m currently recovering from a head cold, and am on antibiotics for a throat infection, so this was a much kinder way to add movement to my morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found it easiest to program the intervals into my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10&lt;/a&gt;, using the custom workout feature. This meant the watch buzzed when I needed to change pace, so I didn’t have to check it every few seconds. Most of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; on the market will allow you to do this, but if you don’t own one, just use the timer function on your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-had-to-really-focus-on-keeping-the-slow-walk-slow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I had to really focus on keeping the slow walk slow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a tendency to rush through my workouts, so the four minute recovery walk was a challenge. I had to really focus on slowing my pace down, taking deep breaths, and letting my heart rate recover during this part of the workout. After all, this is designed to be the recovery part of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found myself breathing in for four, and slowly exhaling, almost like I was in a yoga class, and made an effort to look at my surroundings, rather than watch the seconds go by on my watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-helped-beat-boredom"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It helped beat boredom &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the intro, I walk every day for my physical and mental health. Most days I’ll have my dog with me, some mornings I’ll have my toddler in tow, but this workout made the walk fly by, and really made it more interesting. On my days when I had my baby with me, I strapped him into the running stroller, and he loved the faster intervals. The dog, on the other hand, seemed mighty confused, but I’m sure he’ll get over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My morning walks outside help me manage the stresses and strains of everyday life, and this was definitely an endorphin buster. I personally prefer running outside, but if you’d rather, this could easily be replicated on one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-treadmills" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-treadmills"&gt;best treadmills&lt;/a&gt;, manually changing the speed of the belt to reflect the different paces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this felt a little easy to replace my morning runs for good, it was a great form of active recovery, and a fantastic way to keep my legs moving when I wasn’t feeling 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d definitely recommend this to beginners, and will be returning to it on mornings when I want more than a steady walk to wake me up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Apple Watch Series 10" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Today's best Apple Watch Series 10 deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

But the movement in the Senate suggests an increasingly hawkish mood on Capitol Hill and a growing frustration with Russia’s intransigence among Republicans, who are ramping up their calls for decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, is leading the bipartisan push on the Russia sanctions bill, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. Last week, speaking from the Senate floor, Mr. Graham appeared to be aiming his remarks directly at the president in a bid to persuade him that any influence he may imagine he has over President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia does not appear to be having much impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Putin, in my view, is playing us all,” Mr. Graham warned. He laid out missed opportunities for diplomacy that he said proved Russia was not serious about peace. “President Trump called for a 30-day cease-fire. Ukraine said yes; Russia said no,” he said. “President Trump urged Zelensky and Putin to go to Istanbul — I was over there — and meet to have direct talks. Zelensky went; Putin didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’ve given Russia plenty of opportunity to find an honorable and just end to this war,” Mr. Graham continued. “They’re not interested. And they’re not going to change until we up the ante. So we need moral clarity here. Putin is dragging this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Trump has in recent days hinted at a change in posture. After Russia’s latest assault, he told reporters that he was “not happy” with Mr. Putin and was “considering more sanctions.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused the Russian president of “playing with fire,” saying that if it were not for Mr. Trump, “lots of really bad things would have already happened in Russia.” That prompted a bellicose response from one Russian official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII,” Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Kremlin’s security council, wrote in a social media post. “I hope Trump understands this!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;But it was not clear whether Mr. Trump’s heated rhetoric indicated any change in his broader view that it is time for the United States to wash its hands of involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has signaled a desire to move beyond the war, musing about a potential economic partnership with Russia after a peace deal. A White House adviser recently &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title=""&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that additional sanctions could hinder business opportunities, adding that the president instead wants to focus on maximizing economic opportunities with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;The White House did not reply on Tuesday to requests for an update on Mr. Trump’s stance on sanctions against Russia, and did not say whether he backed the Senate measure or was willing to send more aid or weapons to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In response to questions about Mr. Graham’s bill, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “The Russia-Ukraine war is Joe Biden’s fault, and President Trump has been clear he wants to see a negotiated peace deal. President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;So far, though, Mr. Trump’s desire to look past the current state of the war stands in stark contrast to the views of many Republicans in Congress, who maintain their party’s longstanding view of Russia as a bitter adversary that deserves to be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In a social media post on Monday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa declared that he had seen enough of Mr. Putin killing innocent civilians and publicly urged Mr. Trump to “take action,” urging him to consider “AT LEAST SANCTIONS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;On Tuesday, Mr. Grassley wrote on social media that he thought Mr. Trump had been sincere in thinking his friendship with Mr. Putin would bring an end to the war, but that “ITS TIME FOR SANCTIONS STRONG ENUF SO PUTIN KNOWS ‘game over.’” And he suggested that Mr. Trump should be at least as harsh in trying to cut off Mr. Putin from the world financial system as he has been in seeking to cut off Harvard University from federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Sanctions for Putin like no fed grants for Harvard,” he wrote in his post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Even before the latest assault, other Republicans had called for a tougher stance against Mr. Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Obviously, he’s not been serious about the negotiations,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas said last week when discussing the Russian president’s reluctance to engage in peace talks. Mr. Cornyn praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to bring both countries to the table for negotiations, but said the Russian president would first “have to get serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Both senators, like many Republicans on Capitol Hill, have tried to maintain deference to Mr. Trump’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In an opinion essay published in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday morning, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-u-s-senate-wont-tolerate-putins-games-vladimir-russia-war-ukraine-sanctions-16780c2f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Graham wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “President Trump has asked Vladimir Putin to provide a term sheet outlining the requirements for a cease-fire, bringing the roadblocks to peace to a head.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found drugs in the class, such as baricitinib, which is sold under the brand name Olumiant for the treatment of alopecia - slow down the genes that respond to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These genes play a crucial role in the body's response to viral infections,' said Aleksandr Ianevski, an NTNU researcher and co-author of the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By stopping or slowing down this pathway, JAK inhibitors remove the body's 'antiviral shield'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allows viruses to more easily gain a foothold in the body and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used advanced techniques in a lab to look at how JAK inhibitors impact organs and how viruses attack the body once they have been exposed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined cells from the lungs, eyes and brain, as well as laboratory-created mini-organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of their findings Erlend Ravlo, a PhD research fellow at NTNU, said: 'Although JAK inhibitors are effective in the treatment of inflammation, this shows that they can pose a hidden risk for patients who have latent or active viral infections.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest healthcare professionals should be cautious when prescribing JAK inhibitors, especially during viral outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common side effects of the medications include headaches, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, acne, and elevated cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, rarer but more serious side effects include severe infections like pneumonia or shingles, damage to the stomach or intestines, and changes in blood cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Sarah Erickson, who specializes in treating hair loss, sounds the alarm about JAK inhibitors in one of her TikToks where she notes some of the 'harsh' side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They are relatively new drugs, and the first JAK inhibitor, sold under the brand name Jakafi for cancer treatment, was only just approved by the FDA in 2011 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the immunosuppressive effects of the drugs could be harmful, the researchers point out that it could be useful in controlled environments, such as in the development of vaccines or screening of antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend further studies to better understand how the drugs can be used optimally, especially during virus outbreaks or pandemics,' says Ianevski. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope to increase awareness among doctors and researchers about the effects of these drugs to prevent patients from developing new illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially important for vulnerable patients, such as the elderly or individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in the medical journal, NAR Molecular Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 02:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>肠癌在年轻人中迅速上升：沉默杀手的原因和症状-印度时报 | Bowel cancer is rising rapidly in younger people: Causes and symptoms of the silent killer - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer in young people is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Scientists have found that a bacterial toxin called colibactin may be causing the rise in bowel cancer among young adults. As per them, being exposed to this toxin in childhood could increase the risk of developing cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although researchers are not certain how this exposure occurs, they know that colibactin is produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria in the gut.

It can be caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the lining of the colon or rectum, often starting as small polyps. Symptoms can include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is colibactin linked to bowel cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin has been linked to bowel cancer before, but researchers had not specifically studied its effects on people under 50 until now. This link may help explain why bowel cancer is expected to be the leading cancer-related cause of death for young adults in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that childhood infections produce colibactin, which then harms DNA in the bowel. These mutations can increase the chance of developing cancer later on, often many years after the colibactin is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin-related DNA mutations were found to be 3.3 times more common in adults diagnosed with cancer before age 40 compared to those diagnosed at 70 or older. In older patients, the DNA patterns were more often linked to normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26656679" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="causes-of-bowel-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Causes of bowel cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer is a complex disease with multiple potential causes and risk factors, including age, family history, diet, lifestyle, and certain medical conditions. While the exact cause is not always known, certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing bowel cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key risk factors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The risk of bowel cancer increases significantly with age, with most cases occurring in individuals over 50. However, younger adults of the age group 25-49 are getting more susceptible to the disease with the passing days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Family history:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A family history of bowel cancer or certain inherited conditions like Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) can increase the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A diet low in fiber and high in fat can increase the risk of bowel cancer.

Other common symptoms include rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, abdominal pain or cramping, and a feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely. Fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and weakness are also possible symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Detailed look at symptoms:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Changes in bowel habits:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This can include diarrhea, constipation, or alternating between the two.

Mr. Kennedy, who as health secretary oversees the C.D.C., has repeatedly said that children are at almost no risk from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s true that for many children, a case of Covid will be inconsequential. They might have a runny nose, a cough or other mild symptoms, if any at all, and bounce back within a few days. But some children do become seriously ill and, in rare cases, die from their infections. And data shows that over one million U.S. children have developed long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That discrepancy is at the root of a continuing debate among medical researchers about just how much of a risk Covid poses to children, and whether they should receive annual vaccines against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many agree that the original course of vaccination offered significant protection against serious illness in children. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7248a2.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Data from the C.D.C.&lt;/a&gt; shows that two or more doses of Covid vaccines were 40 percent effective at preventing emergency room visits and hospitalizations among children under the age of 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the question of whether children need annual vaccines to protect against the latest circulating variants is more contentious. Children might not benefit as much as adults would from a yearly shot because their immune systems can remember vaccinations for much longer, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has extensively studied Covid. Another argument against annual shots is that most children in the United States now have some degree of protection from previous infections or vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;COLLIN COUNTY, Texas — Collin County &lt;a href="/article/news/health/second-case-measles-reported-in-collin-county-officials-confirm/287-0c485eb1-e9e3-48b2-b829-137e03d71bdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Health Care Services &lt;/a&gt;announced that a person who was in the county from May 19 to 22 and visited multiple businesses has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a news release from the department, the person visited the following locations in Collin County: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collin County Health Care Services says they are working closely with the Texas Department of State Health Services to monitor the exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted from person-to-person through the air or contaminated surfaces," Health Care Services said. "Measles can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area. Measles can lead to serious health complications."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the listed locations during the specific dates and times should monitor themselves for measles symptoms, Health Care Services said, which include: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflamed eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Koplik’s spots: Small white spots with bluish-white centers located inside the mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, Health Care Services said you should stay home and avoid contact with others, contact your healthcare provider and call before visiting a clinic or hospital to prevent exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The star ingredient of this calming beverage—and the reason behind its golden hue—is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561449/health-benefits-of-turmeric-ginger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;. Known for its vibrant color, turmeric is a root that’s typically enjoyed in powdered form, and it’s brimming with anti-inflammatory compounds that may support gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies suggest that curcumin—the main active compound in turmeric—can help reduce inflammation of the gut lining and, as a result, may help protect against autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to turmeric, golden milk contains several other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7824258/best-anti-inflammatory-spices-for-fighting-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory spices&lt;/a&gt;, including cinnamon, ginger and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-black-pepper-11707883" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;black pepper&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to providing its own anti-inflammatory benefits, black pepper has also been shown to enhance curcumin absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

However, Hochreiter notes that this warming spice may also help keep food moving through your digestive tract, also known as gut motility. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While more research is needed, studies suggest that ginger may help promote gastric emptying, improve gut motility and minimize &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921623/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-an-upset-stomach-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;indigestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s thought that these benefits are due to active compounds found in ginger, including gingerols and shogaols, which may help stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and promote gastrointestinal contractions to keep things moving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated is key for making bathroom visits a smoother experience—literally. Drinking enough fluid can help make stool easier to pass and reduce the risk of constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While we typically think of water when it comes to hydration, milk and plant-based milk alternatives also count toward your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily fluid goal&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some people suggest that turmeric may have a gentle laxative effect and be helpful for reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including constipation. However, research is limited, with larger studies needed to confirm this effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-include-golden-milk-in-a-nightly-routine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Include Golden Milk in a Nightly Routine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a warm mug of golden milk can be a nutritious addition to your bedtime routine, helping you wind down after a long day—and if you don’t have a bedtime routine yet, it may be a good time to start. Research shows that maintaining a regular sleep-hygiene routine can improve sleep quality, which in turn can support numerous other aspects of health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hochreiter agrees: “Pairing your drink with a relaxing bedtime ritual helps to transform this nourishing drink into an act of self-care. When sipped slowly, this warm and soothing drink can help to shift your body into a parasympathetic ‘rest and digest’ state, promoting restful sleep and optimal overnight gut healing.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start by getting into comfortable, breathable clothes, putting your phone away and stepping into your kitchen. Add coconut milk (or other plant-based or cow’s milk), turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper and sweetener of choice to a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the milk into a mug and find a cozy, quiet spot in your home to sip slowly while reading or doing a guided meditation. Wrap up your routine by putting your mug in the sink, and don’t forget to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054788/oral-hygiene-improve-gut-health-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brush your teeth&lt;/a&gt;—after all, your dental hygiene can have a big impact on your gut health, too!

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-drink-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Drink for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, there’s no one “best” drink that’s helpful for everyone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why Hochreiter recommends being wary of trendy beverages that make too-good-to-be-true claims about their benefits on gut health. Instead, she recommends sticking to these general guidelines and selecting a drink that works for your needs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars, Artificial Sweeteners and Gums: &lt;/strong&gt;When possible, opt for drinks with minimal or no added sugars or artificial additives, as they may &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871982/worst-food-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;disrupt the microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and trigger symptoms, like bloating, in some folks. Instead, choose drinks that are naturally sweetened and contain easily recognizable ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Caffeine-Free Options: &lt;/strong&gt;Caffeine-free beverages, like water, milk and herbal teas, tend to be gentler on digestion and less likely to disrupt your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for Prebiotics or Probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;While they aren’t the right fit for everyone, drinks containing prebiotics or probiotics may be beneficial for some. For example, kefir is a nutritious option that provides probiotics, as well as protein and potassium. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rethinking your nightcap may be just what you need to fall asleep faster while also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting gut health&lt;/a&gt;. And when it comes to which drink to sip on before bed, Hochreiter recommends opting for a warm mug of golden milk. In addition to lending a soothing aroma, the spices in this golden-hued beverage may help protect against inflammation in the gut and support healthy digestion. Plus, it’s a flavorful way to boost your fluid intake for the day. So what are you waiting for? Make sure your spice cabinet is stocked and brew yourself a cup of golden milk for a moment of Zen before bed—it might just lead to better zzz’s too!

But like many young people, she started to use more heavily during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The youngest of four sisters, she was was "the light of our lives," her sister Kathleen Dial told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Ms Caldwell's use continued to escalate, to the point that her addiction "started running her life".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She temporarily lost use of her legs after an overdose, which also rendered her incontinent. Still, she continued to use, buying it in local smoke shops, inhaling it in the car park and then heading straight back into the shop to buy more. She sometimes spent hundreds of dollars a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She died last November, in one of those car parks just outside a vape shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"She didn't think that it would hurt her because she was buying it in the smoke shop, so she thought she was using this substance legally," Ms Dial said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The progression of Ms Caldwell's addiction – from youthful misuse to life-threatening compulsion – has become increasingly common. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers found there was a 58 % increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide in the US between 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a worst-case scenario, inhalation of nitrous oxide can lead to hypoxia, where the brain does not get enough oxygen. This can result in death. Regular inhalation can also lead to a Vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause nerve damage, degradation of the spinal column and even paralysis. The number of deaths attributed to nitrous oxide poisonings rose by more than 110% between 2019 and 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Possession of nitrous oxide was criminalised in the UK in 2023 after misuse among young people increased during the pandemic. But while many states have also outlawed the recreational use of the product in the US, it is still legal to sell as a culinary product. Only Louisiana has totally banned the retail sale of the gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Galaxy Gas, a major manufacturer, even offers recipes for dishes, including Chicken Satay with Peanut Chili Foam and Watermelon Gazpacho on their website. With flavours like Blue Raspberry or Strawberries and Cream, experts warn this loophole - as well as major changes in packaging and retail - has contributed to the rise in misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Until recently users would take single-use plain metal canisters weighing around 8g and inhale the gas using a balloon. But when usage spiked during the pandemic, nitrous oxide manufacturers began selling much larger canisters online – as large as 2kg – and, eventually, in shops selling electronic vapes and other smoking paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Companies also began to package the gas in bright colourful canisters with designs featuring characters from computer games and television series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pat Aussem, of the Partnership to End Addiction, believes these developments are behind increased misuse:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even being called Galaxy Gas or Miami Magic is marketing," she said. "If you have large canisters, then it means that more people can try it and use it and that can lead to a lot of peer pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The BBC reached out for comment to both Galaxy Gas and Miami Magic but did not receive a response. Amazon, where the gas is sold online, has said they are aware of customers misusing nitrous oxide and that they are working to implement further safety measures. In a response to reporting from CBS News, the BBC's news partner in the US, Galaxy Gas maintained that the gas was intended for culinary use and that they include a message on their sites warning against misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Concern about nitrous oxide misuse increased last year, after several videos of people using the product went viral online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On social media, videos of young people getting high on gas became a trend. A video uploaded in July 2024 by an Atlanta-based fast-food restaurant featured a young man inhaling Strawberries and Cream flavoured nitrous oxide saying "My name's Lil T, man", his voice made deeper by the gas. To date the clip has been viewed about 40 million times and spawned thousands of copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Misuse also featured heavily in rap music videos and Twitch streaming. Guests tried it on the Joe Rogan Show and rappers including Ye (formerly Kanye West) spoke about abusing the substance publicly. Ye has since sued his dentist for "recklessly" supplying Ye with "dangerous amounts of nitrous oxide".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In response to the trend, TikTok blocked searches for "galaxy gas," and redirected users to a message offering resources about substance use and addiction. Rapper SZA also alerted her social media followers about its harms and slammed it for "being MASS marketed to black children".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an official alert warning against inhaling the gas after it "observed an increase in reports of adverse events after inhalation of nitrous oxide products". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The FDA told the BBC that it "continues to actively track adverse events related to nitrous oxide misuse and will take appropriate actions to protect the public health".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Flavoured nitrous oxide cans sold in a smoke shop near Washington, DC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But for some, these warnings came too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2023, the family of a 25-year-old woman, Marissa Politte successfully sued Nitrous Distributor United Brands for $745m in damages after the radiology technician was killed by a driver high on nitrous oxide. The jury found the company responsible for selling the product in the knowledge that it would be misused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Marissa Politte's death shouldn't have happened in the first place, but my God, it should be the last," Johnny Simon, the Politte family's lawyer, said at the time. In the years since there have been several fatal traffic accidents involving the gas both in the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Meanwhile, Ms Caldwell's family have launched a class action lawsuit against manufacturers and distributors of nitrous oxide, hoping to remove the product from retail sales across the US for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The people who administer nitrous oxide in a dentist office now have to go through hours and hours of training, she said. "It just is crazy to me that the drug can be purchased in a smoke shop to anyone who goes in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Unfortunately, it's become very obvious that the manufacturers and the owners of the smoke shops are not going to do the moral thing and take this off the shelves themselves," Ms Dial said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:20:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5vVXVwempXVWpkNzB0QllTZDMzajloZUJFS1BxTDNBVjd4ZXpaTE9JSGJCMW1JOFBLdUZmWnIwR0I5UzBTaWl5dzExeEZYWUNvVEJxWmVtd1VUd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1OZ1UzQTlLSnExV0ljNUctUUphbnR0OW9LTUQxVHFmTWcycnlqNVFiY1U1MUJlbFl0UExLVGhRSE9sd3JLbXJrOW9KUDdoem9VV2Q0UXZNN2R2OEVZaVlZ</guid></item><item><title>科林县警告在麦金尼的4个公共场所接触麻疹-达拉斯新闻 | Collin County warns of measles exposure at 4 public venues in McKinney - Dallas News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPX3hnNnY1QWswbF9HSk1OYlMtajVkVGhNSDdvcC1DSUdCZU5KOXZJWS01SlZHd0lFeng0d1RxOWhlNTlNTXZGS18tTmtkLXdubnpGaWV2ZTluTjNhcHBORjNNbjRIMzVFeGREV0JsY2RQU1dNSUZuWnJ5ZHFjOWFGWkFwckR5eTdTbWFRZ2I3cnJVdk1LbkdjUWdxYjUyU3VSalAyaGdHZVd0NVg1V3MyS09MSnUxMWJGZWlmZXYyMU4yOFotNWE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="body-text dmnc_features-article-body-body-module__Ldbl- mb-8 false"&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Amid an outbreak of &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/measles/" rel=""&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in Texas, Collin County officials on Tuesday warned the public of exposures at four different locations in McKinney last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In a news release, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/collin-county/" rel=""&gt;Collin County&lt;/a&gt; Health Care Services said there was a measles exposure between May 19 and May 22 at the following locations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="body-text-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;24 Hour Fitness, 1601 N.

Collin County officials said the virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The virus, however, spreads mostly amongst people who are not vaccinated against it.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that managing eight risk factors may help people with hypertension avoid early death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risk factors include cholesterol, blood sugar, smoking status and physical activity, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each factor improved, the researchers observed a lower risk of early death.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hypertension is a major health issue that increases the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and early death. Studies show that more than 30% of adults around the world are affected by hypertension, making it a top cause of preventable deaths globally.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; People with high blood pressure are at a greater risk of developing certain other concerning health conditions, but research has found that managing multiple health factors together can greatly lower these risks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By controlling these factors, individuals with high blood pressure may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce their chances of heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and even eliminate some of the extra risks associated with the condition. For a recent study&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;researchers wanted to further understand how managing multiple risk factors together could lower the chance of dying early for people with high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a result, the researchers determined eight health factors that could help people with high blood pressure lower their risk of early death. The results were published in &lt;em&gt;Precision Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt;—let’s unpack what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was the Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers evaluated data from the UK Biobank study, a large research project that collected health data from more than 500,000 adults aged 40 to 69. Participants provided information about their health and lifestyle through touchscreen questionnaires or interviews at 27 centers across the United Kingdom. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this specific analysis, researchers focused on people with high blood pressure (hypertension), which resulted in 70,898 individuals being included in the study. These participants were then carefully matched with 224,069 people without hypertension based on their age, gender and the center they visited for the study. This matching process ensured the groups were similar, making it easier to compare and understand the effects of hypertension accurately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at eight key health factors to see how well they were being managed. These factors included: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blood pressure &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body mass index (BMI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waist size&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking habits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical activity &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants could have any number of factors under control, from zero to eight. The main focus of the study was to understand early deaths and what might contribute to them. The researchers looked at deaths from all causes, cancer, heart and blood vessel diseases (known as cardiovascular disease) and other causes that happened before the age of 80. To define “early death,” they followed previous research that uses 80 years as the cutoff age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over a follow-up period of almost 14 years, researchers studied over 70,000 individuals with high blood pressure and recorded 6,466 early deaths. These included deaths from cancer, heart disease and other causes. They found that people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/a-healthy-lifestyle-may-offset-genetic-risk-factors-8642546" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better control over key health risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;managing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding smoking, had a significantly lower chance of dying early. Specifically, the risk of dying early from cancer went down by 12%, from heart disease by 21% and from other causes by 10%. People who managed seven or more risk factors effectively showed the most significant protection, lowering their risk of premature death by 40% for all causes, 39% for cancer, 53% for CVD and 29% for other causes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers found that as more health risk factors were well-managed, people with high blood pressure experienced an even lower chance of dying early from all causes, including cancer and heart disease, compared to those without high blood pressure. For those with high blood pressure who kept four or more risk factors under control, their risk of early death was similar to those without high blood pressure. Overall, better control of risk factors led to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-may-reduce-premature-death-risk-by-23-percent-8656685" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significant reductions in early death rates&lt;/a&gt;, with improvements ranging from 30% to over 100% for different causes of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to recognize a few limitations of this study. First, the researchers didn’t take into account any changes in risk factors that might have happened during the follow-up period. Second, even though they adjusted for many different factors, there’s still a chance that some unmeasured factors could have influenced results. Third, most of the participants were white Europeans, so more research is needed to see if the findings apply to people across other groups and identities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, because this study was observational, it’s hard to draw definitive conclusions about cause and effect. While the study points to potential associations, further experimental research is necessary to establish whether these relationships are truly causal or simply coincidental. Finally, the researchers weren’t able to include lifestyle factors in their analysis because of limited data and incomplete reporting by the participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-this-applies-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How This Applies to Real Life &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings of this research highlight how proactively managing multiple health factors may help reduce the risks associated with high blood pressure. If you are living with hypertension, this means that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintaining healthy habits&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;controlling blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/total-exercise-matters-more-than-number-of-days-8725667" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding smoking and maintaining a healthy body weight may drastically improve overall health outcomes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study suggests that even small improvements across key health areas may collectively lower the risk of early death, offering a clear and actionable strategy for individuals aiming to manage their hypertension more effectively. Steps people with high blood pressure should consider taking, based on this study, include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor your blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;Regularly check your blood pressure to ensure it stays within a healthy range, typically below 120/80 mmHg. Consider reducing sodium intake and managing stress levels to help keep it under control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a healthy body weight. &lt;/strong&gt;Though &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;BMI is not a helpful metric&lt;/a&gt; for everyone, these researchers suggest trying to stay within a healthy weight range, which a health care provider can help you determine. Sticking with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-fiber-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-11733961" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;a healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt; can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to keep a healthy waist circumference. &lt;/strong&gt;Some research suggests using waist circumference—not BMI—as a way to gauge how much visceral fat you might be carrying. These researchers recommend a circumference of about 88 centimeters or less for women and 102 centimeters or less for men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat plenty of heart-healthy foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Those foods—like oats, nuts and fatty fish—can help you&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;manage your cholesterol levels. We’d recommend you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-1-thing-to-avoid-if-you-have-high-cholesterol-8691621" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;avoid excess saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, too. And if you’re really concerned about your cholesterol, get support from a health care provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep an eye on your blood sugar. &lt;/strong&gt;Foods like complex carbohydrates, proteins and healthy fats can help keep your blood sugar at a healthy, stable level. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-when-you-wake-up-for-better-blood-sugar-8761186" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Exercise and hydration&lt;/a&gt; can help, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay on top of your kidney health. &lt;/strong&gt;Drink plenty of water daily, limit high-sodium foods and monitor your intake of over-the-counter medications, as excessive use may strain the kidneys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking. &lt;/strong&gt;If you smoke, seek support to quit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay physically active. &lt;/strong&gt;Incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity weekly. To enhance muscle mass and overall fitness, try for a mix of strength training and cardio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in &lt;em&gt;Precision Clinical Medicine &lt;/em&gt;underscores the effect that managing multiple health risk factors may have on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing the risks associated with hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. By addressing areas such as blood pressure, weight, cholesterol and lifestyle habits, people with high blood pressure may significantly lower their risk of early death from various causes, including heart disease and cancer. Small, sustained improvements across these key factors can contribute to meaningful positive outcomes.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A judge ultimately let Jirah reunite with her parents in late March, but Alandria continues to face criminal charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, prosecutors pursued an indictment against the mother, and a grand jury indictment claimed Alandria caused her daughter's injury by 'aggressively grabbing, twisting or pulling the arm of an infant child.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A heavily-redacted arrest warrant obtained by CBS News also described the incident as involving 'grabbing and pulling with force sufficient to cause the fracture.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alandria is now due to make her first court appearance next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, a spokesperson for Children's Health told the outlet that its 'top priority is the health and wellbeing of all our patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to patient privacy concerns, we do not discuss the status of individual patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Child Protective Services also declined to comment, citing confidentiality, but noted that it is complying with all court orders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 22:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNSmtxdmswR3lTSlMzeklodjk3SlZib0Z0alVHM0pBN3VPMG9CdzZ4WFgwTmRWY1JrQVRKOHVkRkd0WmNrVVE5N2laeGx2bnJYbktJVU5TNzVUdFB0M1FJSnRvVGNHSGNHcGhUbXFCcm1NeGNsTjJPRjE1TXEyU0dDZ2s3bUV3VnRNR2ZyVVB1Sk83cmF0MkY0WURVb19EMGpYeHhmUEYyelh1ZGVUdEZHQtIBtgFBVV95cUxPZW45MDE1U0kwSVk0bkFyVlBWa2Z6WjJFbXdUMDUtWWwwYWpMMmlZMG9BUldjZG9JZ3VxbG1lSm51Z2lqZVZreWVaSFV2MUF0NWlJazZvbHZNWFpOelhuSU1zcXV4aDQ1VWxSdjZNTFBIcDNqbDhSSEI0Y1RfNDlNTFFPamRiTTB1ZW5CMzhGNkVpc3VFV0RleUd0Y285alljLXgzMzhjRGtVNlRTb0JwOGxnaklQZw</guid></item><item><title>蜱虫给你的ick ？如果您、您的孩子或宠物被咬，您应该和不应该做什么—雅虎 | Ticks giving you the ick?

Tell them about the recent tick bite, when it occurred and the place it likely occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While a bull’s eye rash is a telltale sign of Lyme disease, it’s not the most common way a Lyme disease rash will present itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Fever, aches, and abrupt and severe fatigue can be the main symptoms of acute Lyme,” according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.hopkinslyme.org/lyme-education/lyme-disease-prevention-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins research center;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Johns Hopkins research center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-antibiotics-necessary-after-a-tick-bite"&gt;Are antibiotics necessary after a tick bite?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, the CDC doesn’t recommend taking antibiotics after a tick bite in order to prevent tick-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“However, in certain circumstances, a single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite in an area where Lyme disease is common may lower risk of Lyme disease,” the CDC website says. It advises that people talk to their health care provider about whether antibiotics are right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-found-a-tick-crawling-on-me-but-it-hasnt-attached-to-my-skin-can-i-get-sick"&gt;I found a tick crawling on me, but it hasn’t attached to my skin. Will I get sick?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. A tick has to bite the skin and feed on a person’s or pet’s blood in order to spread any possible diseases. If you have found one crawling on you, another person or a pet, do a tick check for any other ones that may have attached. If found, remove promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-long-does-it-take-for-an-attached-tick-to-spread-disease"&gt;How long does it take for an attached tick to spread disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It depends on the type of tick and the disease.

You may have been bitten by a different tick that was infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bottom line is that if you have been infected, you will likely develop symptoms before the test results are ready.

And just like humans, pets can also get tick-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is, however, a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7733144/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lyme disease vaccine;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lyme disease vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for dogs.

At the same time, the percentage of mothers who said their mental health was poor increased — particularly among those who were single parents, or whose children had Medicaid or were uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings come at a fraught moment in the national conversation around parenting and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/health/birth-rates-cdc.html" title=""&gt;declining birthrates&lt;/a&gt;. The Trump administration is said to be &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html" title=""&gt;weighing strategies&lt;/a&gt; to persuade more Americans to get married and have children. But just last year, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, who was then the surgeon general, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/upshot/parents-stress-murthy-warning.html" title=""&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; about declining parental mental health in an advisory that described many who were raising children as “exhausted, burned out and perpetually behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The surgeon general’s report led the researchers behind the new study to begin analyzing data from nearly 200,000 mothers who participated in the National Survey of Children’s Health — an annual survey of households with children up to age 17. Researchers found that one in 20 mothers reported her mental health was poor or fair in 2016; by 2023 the ratio was about one in 12. In contrast, one in 22 fathers surveyed reported fair or poor mental health in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are limitations to the study, which was cross-sectional — meaning it looked at snapshots in time but did not follow the same women year over year. It also relied on self-reporting. Still, the findings are not surprising to experts in the field of maternal mental health, who have been observing the decline in emotional well-being for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Tamar Gur, endowed director of the Soter Women’s Health Research Program at Ohio State University, said that if nothing else, the new findings would help reassure the mothers she treats that they are not the only ones struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
