In 2020, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/violinist-plays-surgeons-operate-remove-brain-tumour-n1138436" target="_blank"&gt;violinist played jazz &lt;/a&gt;classics as a tumor was removed from her brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a79b5d" class="body-graf"&gt;Bacon also said she had seen early progress in her walking and is now looking forward to returning to activities such as swimming and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c490b9" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;For the next 20 years, the chest-implanted pulse generator will help Bacon by constantly delivering electrical impulses, and giving her the chance to return to the hobbies and passions she loves, King’s College Hospital said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:03:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQWldRck9weTRDMEtLY0lFNlE1RU52QlpzLUJUN2M3QUtrQ0xKdVZQRkg5bXlMMUlwanVSRndKLXRWVHhHam1MS2JvWk5seG12UERMM1paMjRJbDNTLVMzWDhkb0NqbnBQS2VlN0ZqeXVJbHR6OWVvXzlqZ3E2TGF5dUNoN19QbEE1NWoyc3VTSHZFQnJYdkpxcmF5V21RdlJLbmpNeFhrdks5YThjS3NxLUc1aE9hSG_SAVZBVV95cUxOQlNnODZwdmxmeU1uS3RyQUJlWFpaOU0xdG5OWGk5eDYyakh3djdqMC1lVWdHWlBJUVA2cmdmcEJDRHVVMHktLTJha0lKakwtMDJqQmU5dw</guid></item><item><title>一些尿路感染的一个令人惊讶的原因：受污染的肉类- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/urinary-tract-infections-caused-by-contaminated-meat-rcna238984</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4679d7" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have identified a surprising cause of some urinary tract infections: contaminated meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddf4ca" class="body-graf"&gt;A four-year study found that nearly 1 in 5 UTIs detected among a group of patients in Southern California were most likely caused by the consumption of chicken, turkey, pork or beef that carried E. coli bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-840bd7" class="body-graf"&gt;The common understanding is that most UTIs are caused by improper hygiene or sexual contact. Around 6 million to 8 million cases are recorded in the United States every year, and around &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection" target="_blank"&gt;80% are caused by E. coli bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But the strains responsible for the majority of UTIs are not the ones typically associated with foodborne illnesses, which cause diarrhea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8abcda" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25" target="_blank"&gt;published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal mBio, hints at the prevalence of foodborne UTIs, which were largely unknown to scientists two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4faf66" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is the latest in a long series of studies that have shown that we’re getting some of our urinary tract infections from food,” said Dr. Martin Blaser, a microbiologist at Rutgers University, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da3ec2" class="body-graf"&gt;“A study like this allows people to draw inferences, to understand what’s going on,” he added. “If somebody develops a urinary tract infection, they’re now wondering, ‘Well, was it the hamburger I ate three days ago or five days ago?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d102f" class="body-graf"&gt;When E. coli bacteria from food wind up causing a UTI, they first enter the gut after people touch contaminated meat in the cooking process or eat undercooked meat. From there, the bacteria can get into the urethra as a result of poor hygiene or improper wiping in the bathroom, then ascend into the urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25cebe" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the study’s authors, Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, said he was inspired to investigate the link between UTIs and contaminated meat about 15 years ago, when he noticed that most of the chicken and turkey he tested carried the bacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-796bfe" class="body-graf"&gt;“For some reason, that was basically being ignored. If it didn’t cause diarrhea, it was being ignored. And so that started me on this path,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad4fc5" class="body-graf"&gt;Price’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000381" target="_blank"&gt;previous research estimated, based on modeling, &lt;/a&gt;that foodborne E. coli could account for up to 640,000 UTIs in the United States every year — around 8% of the total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5dc1ce" class="body-graf"&gt;His new findings come from a collaboration with researchers at Kaiser Permanente, who collected more than 2,300 urine samples that were positive for E. coli in Southern California from 2017 to 2021. They also took more than 3,300 samples from meat sold in major grocery stores in the area over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ef358" class="body-graf"&gt;A lab at George Washington University then analyzed the genetic material to determine the origins of people’s infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-431eac" class="body-graf"&gt;“Strains have different DNA signatures, and you can see whether the strains in the animals and the strains in the people match up or not. And they found a number of matches,” Blaser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4e2ee" class="body-graf"&gt;Among the meat sampled, contamination rates were highest in chicken and turkey products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02f5e9" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also found that low-income neighborhoods in Southern California had a 60% higher risk of foodborne UTIs than wealthier neighborhoods. Price and his co-authors suggested that grocery stores in those areas might not have proper storage temperatures or that they may keep products out for too long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1a809" class="body-graf"&gt;Price said he has seen poorly packaged meat sold in some stores in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d37b2" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would buy these packages of chicken that were just bloated, just so full of saline that when I put it on the conveyor belt ... it would just be wet,” he said. “And I know what’s in that liquid: It’s bacteria, and often drug-resistant bacteria, that’s spilling onto these conveyor belts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-640c3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Urinary tract infections can cause painful and frequent urination, and if they are left untreated, they can lead to serious or life-threatening complications, so people with suspected UTIs should seek treatment right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbc9d3" class="body-graf"&gt;“The bladder is a major gateway to the bloodstream for E. coli. And when you get these E. coli in your blood, they can kill you,” Price said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb6add" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors treat UTIs with the same antibiotics regardless of whether the E. coli originated from contaminated meat or another source. (Doctors and patients rarely know the source of an infection, Price said.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f74442" class="body-graf"&gt;Although thoroughly cooking meat and poultry can kill bacteria, Price said, the transmission of foodborne E. coli is mostly due to cross-contamination in the kitchen, so it is important to keep raw meat separate from other items and wash your hands thoroughly after you prepare food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aebd09" class="body-graf"&gt;His study also recommends that meat producers and regulatory agencies consider stricter measures to limit E. coli contamination, such as making sure packages are sealed tightly and do not contain excess liquid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcaca2" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Everybody should have leak-proof packaging in the United States,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOaHV4UFI4NkwwR3ZyV2NsSmVZdkYyUTlKOWdIMk42LW9hX1RuUmNob24wOWkwMGJHQThzUDlRXzZhRi1KUDgtLWdVUVRFNTlpX1Z3eVFYa2F6VUF6REZMRFZsVFZJeW1oTWhfcU5SdThUM1pnWWlGSVh5NXZCbDM3Ml9HTlpqNE5pcXJ0MFNoZjdZSTY1YnE2NGxnZlY2RXZDNU8tVlMtVVdjd9IBVkFVX3lxTFBEWGtKajRqaFo4aS04Tndpc0x1aE9DckVnMDQxOTNzbWVoLWhfRzM1YVVkMUlDbXh6T1UxdzdoWWg2UUQyeEcxeW43MGdQXzhuaWVoLXdn</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19疫苗可以帮助一些癌症患者对抗肿瘤- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The most widely used &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; may offer a surprise benefit for some cancer patients – revving up their immune systems to help fight tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00063b6qyepwfa39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People with advanced lung or skin cancer who were taking certain &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/4c83cc7cc92a430b8c026691e77815c2" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy drugs&lt;/a&gt; lived substantially longer if they also got a Pfizer or Moderna shot within 100 days of starting treatment, according to preliminary research being reported Wednesday in the journal Nature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00073b6q6epnm2ri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it had nothing to do with virus infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00083b6qj2jml1sn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mrna-kennedy-rfk-jr-covid-flu-51babaaeb003c45473080a52d67d7d72" target="_blank"&gt;the molecule that powers those specific vaccines, mRNA&lt;/a&gt;, appears to help the immune system respond better to the cutting-edge cancer treatment, concluded researchers from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct00093b6qvo9ahzw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine “acts like a siren to activate immune cells throughout the body,” said lead researcher Dr. Adam Grippin of MD Anderson. “We’re sensitizing immune-resistant tumors to immune therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000a3b6qjky8kzw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised skepticism about mRNA vaccines, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-pfizer-moderna-1fb5b9436f2957075064c18a6cbbe3c9" target="_blank"&gt;cutting $500 million in funding&lt;/a&gt; for some uses of the technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000b3b6qfym710z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But this research team found its results so promising that it is preparing a more rigorous study to see if mRNA coronavirus vaccines should be paired with cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors — an interim step while it designs new mRNA vaccines for use in cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000c3b6qgq5f5j1k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A healthy immune system often kills cancer cells before they become a threat. But some tumors evolve to hide from immune attack. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viRPsgoqfas&amp;amp;list=PLslqZ7OaczKEUNNDVq-u_OE31P2k7UwKc&amp;amp;index=19" target="_blank"&gt;Checkpoint inhibitors remove that cloak&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a powerful treatment – when it works. Some people’s immune cells still don’t recognize the tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000d3b6q0z0vw6l4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Messenger RNA, or mRNA, is naturally found in every cell and it contains genetic instructions for our bodies to make proteins. While best known as the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-71306bd18785477f3a85a69caa6e09c9" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning technology behind COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have long been trying to create personalized mRNA “treatment vaccines” that train immune cells to spot unique features of a patient’s tumor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000e3b6qvcrqmhrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research offers “a very good clue” that maybe an off-the-shelf approach could work, said Dr. Jeff Coller, an mRNA specialist at Johns Hopkins University who wasn’t involved with the work. “What it shows is that mRNA medicines are continuing to surprise us in how beneficial they can be to human health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000f3b6qqx2m7dp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grippin and his Florida colleagues had been developing personalized mRNA cancer vaccines when they realized that even one created without a specific target appeared to spur similar immune activity against cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000g3b6qjf4hfwyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grippin wondered if the already widely available mRNA coronavirus shots might also have some effect, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000h3b6qajtq56em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So the team analyzed records of nearly 1,000 advanced cancer patients undergoing checkpoint inhibitor treatment at MD Anderson – comparing those who happened to get a Pfizer or Moderna shot with those who didn’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000i3b6qgagydoxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccinated lung cancer patients were nearly twice as likely to be alive three years after beginning cancer treatment as the unvaccinated patients. Among melanoma patients, median survival was significantly longer for vaccinated patients – but exactly how much isn’t clear, as some of that group were still alive when the data was analyzed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2cpbct000j3b6qhe6ovmbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Non-mRNA vaccines such as flu shots didn’t make a difference, he said.

They also were more likely to say that they lost weight, were able to concentrate more, and had better energy than they did before. The researchers even noticed physical changes, like the participants had better blood pressure, vascular health, and liver function, and had less &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a64254355/supplements-for-insulin-resistance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which is considered a precursor to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who cut back—but didn’t quit entirely—saw some improvements in those health metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants were also more likely to drink less and have less signs of alcohol use disorder during a six-month follow-up. Dry January “likely provided an opportunity for self-reflection,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fcitations%3Fuser%3DmyHwm9EAAAAJ%26hl%3Den&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69123057%2Fsober-october-no-alcohol-benefits-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Megan Strowger, PhD;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Megan Strowger, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and post-doctoral research associate at University at Buffalo. “Dry January is a great opportunity to re-evaluate your relationship with alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does skipping alcohol for a month benefit your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, alcoholic drinks have calories, and they can also impact how much people eat, says &lt;a href="https://nursing.gwu.edu/susan-kelly-weeder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Susan Kelly-Weeder, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Susan Kelly-Weeder, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; researcher and dean of the George Washington University School of Nursing. “People often eat after drinking in an attempt to decrease the impact of the alcohol and so consume extra calories,” she says, adding that drinking lowers inhibitions, which could further influence what and how much you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being at an unhealthy weight can raise the risk of a host of health issues, while cutting out alcohol can help with healthy weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, alcohol can mess with your sleep, which can impact your physical and mental health, Kelly-Weeder points out. “Most adults do not get enough quality sleep and we know that alcohol use interferes with deep restful sleep,” she says. “Once alcohol is eliminated, people begin to sleep better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the mental health side, alcohol can do a number on your brain, Strowger says. “Alcohol’s reputation is people having fun and the social benefits, but alcohol is fundamentally a depressant. Over time, that can impact mood, happiness, and mental health. By removing that influence in a short period [like Sober October or Dry January], it allows the brain to stabilize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you cut back (but don't quit)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found you can still see health perks if you just drink here and there. “The key takeaway is that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reduction in alcohol consumption helps,” Strowger says. Even if someone didn’t fully avoid alcohol for the entire month, cutting back from their usual amount resulted in some health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, experts say it’s a good idea to reduce your alcohol use when you can. “Every little bit helps,” Kelly-Weeder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 11:36:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5oOFJ3VlpSV2NPVnA3S0Vhb1ZaZk02dHFFQXRaMkFJY2hlMnkxdlRkZ1RxaWQ5RTgzXzI4R3loSjA1UVFKSkN5M0xnNTRadjR1NEE5R0ltaTV6ZVMtUGNhRFdBeU9YUHRoRGZKRWszU2RTLV9sal9oWGdjdTI</guid></item><item><title>爱达荷州禁止接种疫苗。活动人士希望将其作为国家的典范- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/health/idaho-vaccine-mandates-propublica</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Three women become choked up as they deliver news in a video posted to social media. “We did it, everybody,” says Leslie Manookian, the woman in the middle. She is a driving force in a campaign that has chipped away at the foundations of modern public health in Idaho. The group had just gotten lawmakers to pass what she called the first true “medical freedom” bill in the nation. “It’s literally landmark,” Manookian said. “It is changing everything.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28379i00063b6qwk0h4nty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With Manookian in &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v6ro3bt-idahos-health-freedom-act-becomes-law.html" target="_blank"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt; are two of her allies, the leaders of Health Freedom Idaho. It was April 4, hours after the governor signed the &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title73/t73ch5/" target="_blank"&gt;Idaho Medical Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt; into law.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh27kg8200003b6qawgsdcip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The act makes it illegal for state and local governments, private businesses, employers, schools and daycares to require anyone to take a vaccine or receive any other “medical intervention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmh2fgrvn003v3b6q3d6quy66@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283gfv000c3b6qjzcq6oge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether the law will actually alter day-to-day life in Idaho is an open question, because Idaho already made it easy to get around the few existing vaccination requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283gfv000d3b6q9l5rl5sq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it could have a significant effect in other states, where rules aren’t already so relaxed. And it comes at a time when diseases once eradicated from the U.S. through vaccination are making a resurgence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283f7h000a3b6qw9fh0dzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The law runs against one of the hallmarks of modern public health: that a person’s full participation in society depends on their willingness to follow certain rules. (Want to send your child to public school? They’ll need a measles vaccine. Want to work in a retirement community during flu season? You might have to wear a mask.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000i3b6qgete73be@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Idaho law flips that on its head. It not only removes the obligation to follow such rules, it makes the rules themselves illegal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000j3b6qgcjs50p4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new law sets Idaho apart from even conservative-leaning South Carolina, where &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unvaccinated-students-quarantining-measles-south-carolina/" target="_blank"&gt;two schools recently&lt;/a&gt; quarantined more than 150 unvaccinated children after measles arrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000k3b6q4hu5lvj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A person &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/communication-resources/clinical-diagnosis-fact-sheet.html#:~:text=Disease%20course,4%20days%20after%20rash%20onset" target="_blank"&gt;can spread measles&lt;/a&gt; for four days before symptoms appear. During the South Carolina schools’ quarantine, five students began to show symptoms, but the quarantine kept them from spreading it, &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-increases-measles-case-count-16-total-2025-12-related-upstate" target="_blank"&gt;the health department said this month&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000l3b6qrilyw9f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That precaution would now be illegal in Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000m3b6qj3ch7app@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho’s law caught the attention of people who share Manookian’s belief that — contrary to &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of years of public health evidence and rigorous regulation in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; — vaccines are worse than the diseases they prevent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283rml000n3b6qp3m1y8sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also caught the attention of people like Jennifer Herricks, a pro-vaccine advocate in Louisiana and &lt;a href="https://www.familiesforvaccines.org/staff-bios/#jenniferherricks" target="_blank"&gt;advocacy director for American Families for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh283pvm000g3b6qqqvnl99h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Herricks and her counterparts in other states say that vaccine requirements have “done so much good for our kids and for our communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000s3b6qwq8stm7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;analysis published last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; found that routine childhood vaccines prevented more than 1.1 million deaths and 32 million hospitalizations in the U.S. over three decades, saving $540 billion in direct costs and saving society about $2.7 trillion. The analysis was limited; it didn’t account for the lives and money saved by vaccines for flu or RSV, which kill and hospitalize babies and children each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000t3b6qyx9ibixg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho’s move was “pretty concerning,” Herricks said, “especially seeing the direction that everything is headed at the federal government.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000u3b6qsp8rpw7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The law is the culmination of a decade of anti-vaccine activism that got a boost from the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000v3b6q0fe8u7uu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s rooted in a belief system that distrusts institutions — government health agencies, vaccine makers, medical societies and others — on the premise that those institutions seek only money and control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000w3b6qqv2t72f7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian said in an interview that she believes one person should never be told to risk their health in “the theoretical” service of another.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2843nu000x3b6qwdbpumvb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manookian and her allies have a new goal in their sights: to make Idaho’s legislation a nationwide standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="vossi-divider" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/divider/instances/cmh2fjc2n00433b6qe2upy654@published" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2842d1000q3b6quwauaxj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho was already more permissive than other states when it came to vaccine rules. Parents since at least the 1990s could send unvaccinated children to school if they signed a form saying vaccination went against their religious or personal beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00143b6qk7k3bkni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That wasn’t good enough for Idahoans who describe themselves as advocates for health freedom. They worked to shift the paradigm, bit by bit, so that it can be easier now for parents to get a vaccine exemption than to show the school their child is actually vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00153b6q8m1odeo0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In recent years, lawmakers ordered schools and daycare centers to tell parents about &lt;a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title39/T39CH48/SECT39-4801/" target="_blank"&gt;the exemptions allowed in Idaho&lt;/a&gt; whenever they communicate about immunizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00163b6qlwwjvhh7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state also decided to let parents exempt their kids by writing a note, instead of having to fill out a form — one that, in the past, required them to acknowledge the risks of going unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00173b6qbawdi4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (There is conflicting data on whether these changes truly affected vaccination rates or just led more parents to skip the trouble of handing in vaccine records. Starting in 2021, Idaho schools reported a steady drop in the share of kindergartners with documented vaccinations. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/childvaxview/about/interactive-reports.html" target="_blank"&gt;Phone surveys&lt;/a&gt; of parents, by contrast, showed vaccination rates have been largely unchanged.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00183b6qwz2h4qqs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An enduring backlash against Idaho’s short-lived COVID-19 mandates gave Manookian’s movement more momentum, culminating this year in what she considered the ultimate step in Idaho’s evolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284l2a00193b6q8crxnzw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian had a previous career in finance in New York and London. She transitioned to work as a homeopath and advocate, ultimately returning to her home state of Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284jn800123b6qv19975d2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bill she came up with said that almost nobody can be required to have a vaccine or take any test or medical procedure or treatment in order to go to school, get a job or go about life how they’d like to. In practice, that would mean schools couldn’t send unvaccinated kids home, even during a measles outbreak, and private businesses and daycares couldn’t require people on their property to follow public health guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284xb7001e3b6qy53ay4pb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state had just passed “the Coronavirus Stop Act” in 2023, which banned nearly all COVID-19 vaccine requirements. If lawmakers did that for COVID-19, Manookian reasoned, they could do the same for all communicable diseases and all medical decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh284vva001c3b6qsvqaorn9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her theory was right, ultimately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001j3b6qapsmxvfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bill she penned in the summer of 2024 made it through the Republican-controlled House and Senate in early 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001k3b6q6rgroaj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian took to social media to rally support for the legislation as it sat on the desk of Gov. Brad Little.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001l3b6qenatem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the governor vetoed it. &lt;a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/veto_s-1023aaaa_2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;In a letter&lt;/a&gt;, he explained that he saw the bill as government intrusion on “parents’ freedom to ensure their children stay healthy.” During an outbreak, he said, schools wouldn’t be able to send home students “with highly contagious conditions” like measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001m3b6qwlpcvgoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian tried again days after the veto. In the next version of the bill, protections during a disease outbreak applied only to “healthy” people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28585r001n3b6q4hq4och7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, Little signed it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="vossi-divider" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/divider/instances/cmh2fjmbv00463b6qj6cyn8bs@published" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2856jy001h3b6qmx0c19u2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weeks after the signing, Manookian joined like-minded advocates on a stage in Washington, D.C., for a launch event for the MAHA Institute, a group with strong ties to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (MAHA stands for Make America Healthy Again.) The new Health and Human Services secretary had denounced vaccines for years before President Donald Trump appointed him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285ob5001u3b6qyq6umh4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the gathering, Manookian announced her next mission: to make it “a societal norm and to codify it in law” that nobody can dictate any other person’s medical choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285ob5001v3b6qlbkx1vxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to roll that out to other states, and we’re going to make America free again,” Manookian &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fONtd73sNJg?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=81" target="_blank"&gt;told the audience&lt;/a&gt; in May.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285ob5001w3b6qzyfz6w09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian’s commitment to bring along the rest of the country has continued ever since.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285n48001s3b6qcmnckkz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her nonprofit, the Health Freedom Defense Fund, is now distributing &lt;a href="https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/" target="_blank"&gt;model legislation and a how-to guide&lt;/a&gt;, with talking points to persuade legislators. Manookian said in podcast interviews that she is working with the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://standforhealthfreedom.com/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;Stand For Health Freedom&lt;/a&gt; to mobilize activists in every state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285yyf00213b6q1loqbusp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview with ProPublica, Manookian said her objective is for people to “understand and appreciate that the most basic and fundamental of human rights is the right to direct our own medical treatment — and to codify that in law in every state. Breaking that barrier in Idaho proves that it can be done, that Americans understand the importance of this, and the humanity of it, and that it should be done in other states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285yyf00223b6qjjp9o7om@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her efforts were rewarded over the summer with a visit from none other than Kennedy, who visited Boise and toured a farm &lt;a href="https://x.com/LeslieManookian/status/1950684276510629904" target="_blank"&gt;with Manookian and state lawmakers in tow.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285yyf00233b6qchq9myla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This state, more than any other state in the country” aligns with the MAHA campaign, Kennedy told reporters at a news conference where no one was allowed to ask questions. Kennedy called Idaho “the home of medical freedom.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh285x9j001z3b6qok66uvdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to ProPublica’s request for comment from Kennedy or his staff on Idaho’s law and his visit to the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq00283b6qc2fh8pn6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children’s Health Defense, the organization Kennedy built into one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines, took interest in the Idaho bill early on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq00293b6qz5xqz8iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group promoted the bill as it sat on the governor’s desk, as he vetoed it, then as Manookian worked successfully to get a revived bill through the statehouse and signed into law.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002a3b6qz9wcowgz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization’s online video programming featured Manookian five times in late March and early April. One show’s host told viewers they could follow Idaho in its “very smart strategy” of taking a law against COVID-related mandates, “crossing out ‘COVID,’ making a few other tweaks, and you have an incredible health freedom bill after that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002b3b6qds4b5uu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children’s Health Defense CEO &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/mary-holland-j-d/" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Holland&lt;/a&gt; said she’s known Manookian for more than 15 years and pushed the national organization to publicize Manookian’s work. Holland introduced her at the Washington, D.C., event.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002c3b6qax4d8nbc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whereas most states put the onus on unvaccinated people to show why they should opt out of a mandate, Idaho’s legislation made unvaccinated people the norm — shifting the burden of accommodation onto those who support vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002d3b6q38a1ktxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, parents of infants too young for a measles vaccine can’t choose a daycare that requires immunization. Parents of immune-compromised students must decide whether to keep their children home from school during an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases, knowing unvaccinated children won’t be quarantined.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002e3b6q7otzr5gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements imposed by states like California and New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286gyq002f3b6qsxocitcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think you could certainly do that in Idaho.” Holland said. “It wouldn’t be a public school. It might be the Church of Vaccinia school.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="vossi-divider" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/divider/instances/cmh2fjw0q00493b6qoly8fmmx@published" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh286fkj00263b6qe3iivdad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The day Idaho’s Medical Freedom Act was signed, a legislator in Louisiana brought forward &lt;a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=25rs&amp;amp;b=HB555&amp;amp;sbi=y" target="_blank"&gt;the Louisiana Medical Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt;. In a hearing later, she pointed to Idaho as a model.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2895cp002m3b6qprj9cz3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Louisiana followed Idaho once before in 2024, when it &lt;a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=245567" target="_blank"&gt;passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that requires schools to describe the exemptions available to parents whenever they communicate about immunizations. Idaho had passed an almost identical law three years earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2895cp002n3b6qgn3gfqw2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Herricks, the Louisiana pro-vaccine advocate, said she watched the Idaho Medical Freedom Act’s progress with “a lot of concern, seeing how much progress it was making.” Now it’s set a precedent, Herricks said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh2893yk002k3b6qaeinf532@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland, the Children’s Health Defense CEO, said she looks forward to Idaho’s approach spreading.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002s3b6qkten8za6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She pointed to a September announcement by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo that he intends to rid his state of all vaccine mandates. Holland said she expects other Republican-controlled states to take a serious look at the Idaho law. (Ladapo’s office did not respond to requests for comment.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002t3b6qv2o41jqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a big change,” Holland said. “It’s not just related to vaccines. It’s a blow against the notion that there can be compulsory medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002u3b6q1nufh5qz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people support the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/requirements-research" target="_blank"&gt;more-than-century-old notion&lt;/a&gt; that compelling people to be vaccinated or masked will provide such enormous collective benefits that it outweighs any inconvenience or small incursion on personal liberty.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002v3b6q3t29t962@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others, like Holland and Manookian, do not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002w3b6q2dnr8gw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the heart of laws like Idaho’s is a sense of, “‘I’m going to do what I want to do for myself, and I don’t want anybody telling me what to do,’ which is in direct contrast to public health,” said Paul Offit, pediatrician and vaccinologist at the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002x3b6qxv2l6vwr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Offit, who co-invented a vaccine against rotavirus, is a critic of Kennedy and was removed from a federal vaccine panel in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002y3b6q5tbbtspl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A more fundamental conflict is that some people believe vaccines and other tools to prevent the spread of illness, like masks, are harmful. That belief is at odds with the overwhelming consensus of scientists and health experts, including Kennedy’s own &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251015193709/https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/safety/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251012054453/https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289gd8002z3b6qm74tk096@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both tensions are at play in Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289esg002q3b6q6x6vgf5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As is the case nationally, Idaho’s “health freedom” movement has long pushed back against being labeled “anti-vaccine.” Idaho lawmakers and advocates have stressed that their goals are bodily autonomy and informed choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289rzc00343b6q9te14vww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They do not take a stance on the bodily autonomy principle when it comes to abortion, however. Almost all state legislators who voted for the Idaho Medical Freedom Act also voted to ban abortion, if they were in office at both times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh289qpw00323b6q3zlvfqag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every action has to be evaluated on its individual morality,” not on whether it does the most good for the most people, Manookian said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr00393b6qbxnhd4rf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Manookian’s rejection of vaccine mandates goes beyond a libertarian philosophy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr003a3b6qxxei4978@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian has said publicly that she thinks vaccines are “poison for profit,” that continuing to let daycares require vaccination would “put our children on the chopping block,” that measles is “positive for the body,” that the virus protects against cancer, and that it can send people “into total remission” — an assertion she made on an Idaho wellness center’s podcast in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh28a4rr003b3b6qz4ucta54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manookian told ProPublica she believes infectious diseases have been made “the bogeyman.”

            Against those claims, research has shown that having the measles &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;suppresses immunity to other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon dubbed &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;“immune amnesia”&lt;/a&gt; that can make children who have recovered from measles &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;more susceptible to pneumonia and other bacterial and viral infections&lt;/a&gt;. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected will die from complications of the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            And while researchers have studied using engineered measles viruses in a cancer treatment, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619619304628" target="_blank"&gt;those same researchers have written that&lt;/a&gt; they were “dismayed to learn” their research has been misconstrued by some who oppose vaccination. They said they “very strongly advise” giving children the measles vaccine, that there “is no evidence that measles infection can protect against cancer” and that measles is “a dangerous pathogen, not suitable for use as a cancer therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, meanwhile, is safe and highly effective, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/infectious-disease/measles/know-the-facts" target="_blank"&gt;the Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, among others. The CDC says the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;most common negative reactions&lt;/a&gt; are a sore arm, fever or mild rash. Two doses of the vaccine provide near total protection, according to the CDC.

&lt;p&gt;How many steps do you need to reap health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/10/13/bjsports-2025-110311"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by investigators from Harvard and Mass General Brigham examined 13,547 older women, comparing their step counts over a one-week period against their mortality and cardiovascular disease rates over the next decade. The researchers found that achieving just 4,000 steps one or two days per week was associated with lower risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease — and with more steps came even greater benefits, up to a point when risk reductions leveled. The results were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-harvard-gazette-supporting-content alignleft supporting-content" id="supporting-content-928eff49-67bc-47a0-8875-e207b6ab6726"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health benefits seem to be associated with the total volume of steps taken, rather than how many days per week a particular threshold was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In countries like the United States, advances in technology have made it such that we don’t really move very much, and older individuals are among those least active,” said senior author I-Min Lee, an epidemiologist at Mass General and at the Harvard Chan School. “Because of today’s low step counts, it’s increasingly important to determine the minimum amount of physical activity required to improve health outcomes, so that we can offer realistic and feasible goals for the public.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this federally funded study, researchers conducted a prospective cohort study of 13,574 older women (71.8 years old on average) without cardiovascular disease or cancer from the long-running &lt;a href="https://whs.bwh.harvard.edu/"&gt;Women’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;. The women wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers to track their steps over seven days between 2011 and 2015. For the next 10 years, the researchers monitored mortality and cardiovascular disease incidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were sorted by how many days per week they achieved step thresholds at or above 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, or 7,000. Those who got 4,000 steps one or two days per week had 26 percent lower mortality risk and 27 percent lower cardiovascular disease risk compared to those who never hit 4,000 on any day. What’s more, reaching 4,000 steps three or more days in a week decreased mortality risk further to 40 percent. As for women who reached the higher step thresholds, cardiovascular disease risk leveled out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the health benefits seem to be associated with the total volume of steps taken, rather than how many days per week a particular threshold was achieved. This suggests that there isn’t a “better” way to get steps — women with a similar total volume of steps, achieved either by consistent steps throughout the week or sporadic steps in just a few days, had similar health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to explore whether these effects hold in populations beyond older, mostly white women in the U.S. Additionally, the researchers are curious to analyze even lower step count thresholds to determine whether fewer than 4,000 steps can produce similar health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I hope our findings encourage the addition of step count metrics to physical activity guidelines, including the upcoming 2028 U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines,” said lead and corresponding author Rikuta Hamaya of Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “If we can promote taking at least 4,000 steps once per week in older women, we could reduce mortality and cardiovascular disease risk across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other authors on the study were &lt;a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/kelly-r-evenson/"&gt;Kelly R. Evenson&lt;/a&gt; of UNC, Chapel Hill, and &lt;a href="https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/people/daniel-e-lieberman"&gt;Daniel Lieberman&lt;/a&gt; of Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in a complete freefall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the reign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the longtime crank turned U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cdc-terminations-workforce-shutdown-rifs/"&gt;thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; have lost their jobs, the organization’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; have been hijacked by allies of the anti-vaccination movement, and workers there have endured a deadly shooting committed by a man whose motives were likely &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/08/17/im-gonna-shoot-up-cdc-patrick-joseph-whites-father-details-his-familys-horrors/"&gt;influenced by misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about the covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most dramatic upheaval &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;occurred&lt;/a&gt; in late August, when former CDC director Susan Monarez was fired just four weeks into taking the role. Monarez has since &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk"&gt;publicly testified&lt;/a&gt; that she was let go for refusing to sign off, without review, on the vaccine-related recommendations of RFK’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;handpicked advisors&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom—like Kennedy himself—have a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Immediately after Monarez’s reported firing, in a coordinated act of protest, three senior staff members at the CDC turned in their resignation notice: Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer, Daniel Jernigan, former director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (a fourth senior official, Jennifer Layden, former director of the CDC’s Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology, also resigned).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“We should practice detachment from the organizations and focus on the mission. And the mission is the health of the public.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gizmodo reached out to Daskalakis to discuss the events within the CDC leading up to the resignation, the fallout since, and what the path forward might look like in a world where trust in the CDC has eroded. The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Cara, Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you take us through the first days and weeks of the second Trump administration for you and others at the CDC? What was the general mood?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demetre Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; Soon after the election, when President Donald Trump announced that RFK Jr. was going to be his candidate for the Secretary of Health and Human Services—that was obviously the beginning red flag.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prior to the CDC, I had worked in New York City for many years in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. While there, I had been involved as the incident commander over the measles outbreak from 2018 to 2019. And that’s the first time that I had any awareness of the sort of anti-vaccine strategies of RFK Jr. and the organizations he participated in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So while we were running the measles response, one of his organizations, Children’s Health Defense, was working to undermine the work we were doing. It supported anti-vaccine messaging, and RFK Jr. would go on to &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2019/07/10/robert-f-kennedy-jr-sues-new-york-in-attempt-to-stop-state-from-outlawing-religious-exemptions-to-vaccinations/"&gt;sue the health department&lt;/a&gt; while we were in the middle of our response, trying to destabilize what we were doing. At that point, I was like, “There’s this kooky guy who’s a Kennedy who is really trying to interfere with this important work to prevent kids from getting sick.” So when they said his name as the candidate, I was like, “Oh boy.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: Kennedy founded Children’s Health Defense and served as its chairman and chief litigation counsel before resigning ahead of his failed presidential run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then I did research on it, and not just me, all the doctors at CDC who were in leadership. We all read books, we looked at papers, to figure out what we were up for. And also to see where there were opportunities for us to integrate our sort of science and strategy in public health with what will be the vision of the new secretary. It’s what you do as a civil servant: How do I work with the new leadership and still make sure that we’re protecting the health of the country?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before he was appointed, though, there were the confirmation hearings. Ahead of those hearings, his cousin [Carolyn Kennedy] &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5278407/caroline-kennedy-rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing"&gt;came out&lt;/a&gt;, called him a predator and said that he was dangerous for American health. So that was something. And watching the hearings, I was not particularly impressed. He seemed not very well prepared, but that’s probably less his problem and more his teams. But we made it through that and then he got confirmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next thing that I did was, when he gave his &lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/rfk-jr-delivers-welcoming-remarks-to-hhs-staff"&gt;big talk&lt;/a&gt; at HHS after he was sworn in, I made my whole team stop doing work so they could hear what he had to say. And honestly, it was good. He said gold standard science and radical transparency are things that he was going to uphold. And he made it seem like he was going to engage with the scientists and the experts across HHS to make sure that we’re going down the right scientific path. So we took copious notes, and we felt like we could do it—we’re going to figure out how to work with this guy. We prepared all these transition documents, all these plans, all these things to be ready to talk to him.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Then what happened?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; Then he landed and we never, ever heard from him. We reached out to try to brief him. He never said yes. We talked to his teams. They never said yes. And the communications we were getting were some combination of dismantling CDC and doing really unhinged policy things. Around February 14th, we had our &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge"&gt;first CDC massacre&lt;/a&gt; where they fired a bunch of people who were newly hired staff. April 1st, we had our &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/01/g-s1-57485/hhs-fda-layoffs-doge-cdc-nih"&gt;next CDC massacre&lt;/a&gt; where they literally deleted thousands of positions from CDC. And then just now, we had our &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/cdc-job-cuts-partial-reversal"&gt;third CDC massacre&lt;/a&gt;. We’re now about a quarter down of the staff that we had in CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“There’s no need to destroy public health to rebuild it.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there’s all the policy things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He changed the covid-19 vaccine recommendations for kids and pregnant women via a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; [in late May]. We had heard nothing about it before that. He had never conferred with any scientists. When we asked him if we could get the documents underlying the data that support your decision, his staff said no. So CDC was directed to make changes and no one had ever seen the data underneath it. So we made it; we tried to mitigate that and made it a little bit not as bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then fired all of the experts on the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), which is the body responsible for guiding CDC on what they should do for vaccine policy. And he replaced them mostly with people who were, frankly, political appointees who were ideologically aligned to his desire to dismantle and destroy vaccines. They’ve changed the way that the committee works. The entire agenda, the entire membership, all of the conversations are only driven by these people that he put in who are his ideological clones and the scientists are completely sidelined, only being able to provide data as requested rather than really engaging in the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And then, of course, Susan Monarez was fired. There was this brief shining moment when we had a scientific leader who was going to help be a diplomat to build the bridge between us and the secretary. And then he basically told her that he didn’t want her science here; he just wanted her to sign off on these recommendations. And they fired her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;So the Monarez firing was the breaking point that led you and your senior colleagues to resign in protest?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s what led all of us to get together, and for me to say that it was time to go, because I can’t support something that’s not going to use good science, something that will potentially end up making terrible decisions for the country that could impact the health of people.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But we had all been writing our resignation letters. I started my resignation letter when he fired ACIP because I was like, “I just need to have all this documentation for the moment when I have to get out of here, because I can’t do any good anymore.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. was dictating things in a way that wouldn’t let science get done or be reviewed adequately. But then I was very excited when Susan came aboard, when she had this moment of like, let’s try to work with this and make it better. She had a vision for how to do it. And he just threw it aside. She was like a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-secretary-kennedy-swears-in-susan-monarez-as-cdc-director-to-advance-make-america-healthy-again.html#:~:text=%22Dr.%20Monarez%20is,and%20biosecurity%20threats.%22"&gt;trusted expert&lt;/a&gt; two months before, and now she’s absolutely a demon. So when we lost that scientific leadership, it was the end.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“These are a bunch of rookies that don’t know even how to run a medium-sized organization, much less one that’s complex like CDC.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bottom line, their office of the director at CDC only had one person other than Susan who was a scientist, and that was Debra Houry. So when that conversation began and she said she was also going to leave, that was the end of that. It’s like having a head and body but with no neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you say to the critiques made by RFK Jr. and his allies that all this chaos is needed? That the only way to “Make America Healthy Again,” as his saying goes, is to dismantle the status quo of the CDC and the country’s public health systems in general?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; I call bullshit on it. It’s garbage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no need to destroy public health to rebuild it. There is a rational way to do it. The CDC, especially since covid, has changed a lot. Could it change more? Yes, but do you do it by destroying CDC? That’s like flying a plane holding hundreds of people, thinking that the engine’s not so great, and trying to rebuild the engine while it’s flying. Even worse, it’s like blowing up a plane while it’s flying and hoping all the parts will land somewhere safe and the people will be fine. It’s beyond irrational.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tearing the CDC apart while saying that you’re going to make it better also means that we’re completely not prepared in the event that something disastrous happens. And frankly, we’re not really prepared for the routine work either, because it’s like an interconnected organism. We had already made proposals on how to make the CDC more efficient and how to do it quickly. But they wouldn’t take them. Instead, they’re taking this tech bro strategy of, “Let’s break it and then see how it goes.” And you don’t want your public health done that way.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;How has the CDC been doing since your resignation, in your opinion?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s just getting worse, and they still don’t have any scientific leadership. The guy who they claim is the acting director of CDC, Jim O’Neill, has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/29/politics/jim-oneill-cdc-vaccine-meetings#:~:text=O%E2%80%99Neill%20has%20had%20little%20discernible%20interaction%20with%20the%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20rank%20and%20file%20since%20joining%20the%20administration%20in%20June%2C%20the%20people%20familiar%20with%20the%20matter%20said."&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/10/the-cdcs-weekend-of-whiplash/684549/"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with the senior leadership at CDC—it’s now been about five weeks since he was appointed. And yet he feels comfortable, as a non-scientist, tweeting out things about &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1975208317850116544"&gt;separating&lt;/a&gt; the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1971675338918023441"&gt;congratulating themselves&lt;/a&gt; for taking down websites that are important for people’s health because they have the word “equity” or talk about gender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this latest reduction in force, it’s disastrous, even if some of those firings have been reversed. Right now, the CDC doesn’t have an &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/13/trump-kennedy-cdc-firings-rehirings#:~:text=ethics%20office%20that%20reviews%20conflicts%20of%20interest"&gt;ethics office&lt;/a&gt;; they don’t have an &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/whiplash-cdc-hundreds-employees-are-terminated-then-reinstated#:~:text=Staff%20with%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20institutional%20review%20board%2C%20which%20reviews%20the%20design%20of%20studies%20involving%20human%20subjects%2C%20were%20also%20let%20go"&gt;institutional review board;&lt;/a&gt; and they don’t have the organization that looks after the advisory committees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: Some of the employees fired in this latest round were responsible for overseeing conflicts of interests in these committees, while the Trump administration has previously &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/healthcare-associated-infections/trump-administration-shuts-down-federal-advisory-committee"&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; several advisory committees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s supposed to be radical transparency, but they can’t communicate because they got rid of all their communicators. They can’t run a advisory committee because they got rid of the advisory committee groups. And they can’t review science to be able to go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;What about those still left behind at the CDC? How have they been faring through all this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis: &lt;/strong&gt;The staff is horribly traumatized. Two months ago, that place was shot with 500 bullets. My office has a giant hole in the window because of a bullet. And RFK Jr. came down, said thoughts and prayers, and then immediately went to an interview and said not to trust experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author’s note: During an August 11 interview three days after the shooting, RFK &lt;a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/rfk-jr-in-interview-with-scripps-news-trusting-the-experts-is-not-science"&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt;, “Trusting the experts is not a feature of either science or democracy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one seems to cares. When an ICE facility got shot up last month, the president ten minutes later had a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552278/trump-blames-dallas-ice-shooting-on-radical-leftists"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about it. He has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/08/15/trump-cdc-police-officer-silence/"&gt;never said one word&lt;/a&gt; about the shooting at CDC; not one word about the police officer who died to protect us. So they do not value the workers, they do not value the work. For them, dismantling the CDC is no big deal and, frankly, it’s because they don’t understand the value that public health gives to the country and the world. Because these are a bunch of rookies that don’t know even how to run a medium-sized organization, much less one that’s complex like CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Circling back a bit, it seems like breaking up the MMR vaccine—something that both acting CDC director O’Neill and President Trump have called for—would be the most dramatic change in vaccine policy seen yet. Just how realistic are the odds of that happening?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; A year ago, I would have said it’s totally not possible. First of all, there’s no separate measles vaccine that’s produced and available in the U.S., and there’s no such thing as a separate mumps and rubella vaccine, either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these people don’t follow any sort of political norms. And as we’ve seen with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trump-and-rfk-jr-blame-tylenol-for-autism-in-new-report-but-experts-push-back-2000662054#:~:text=This%20cautionary%20tale,of%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mandell%20said."&gt;leucovorin&lt;/a&gt;, the drug that they approved for autism, they also don’t follow any sort of standard regulatory pathways. So I can’t predict if they’re going to do it. I don’t put anything past this administration’s ability to circumvent science and process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Remarkably, we’re not even a full year into this second term. Given how dire the CDC’s situation is right now, what’s to be done, in your opinion? Is there a way to navigate ourselves out of this catastrophe in the making?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daskalakis:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a complicated question, but I have a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now, looking at CDC, it is pretty irreparably damaged. We can criticize the pandemic response, but CDC did a lot of important functions and did actually function very well for most of what it was doing. Post-pandemic, there were many changes to CDC, related to what the experience was during the pandemic. But now, with a quarter of the staff gone, with no strategic plan around why they’re gone, it’s all just patchwork. What CDC is like now is a smartphone with all of its apps but no operating system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my simple answer is that federal public health has now been compromised—it has been taken over by ideology, it’s been weaponized. If you look at the CDC website, the “About” webpage is literally &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-republicans-trump-administration-hud"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; around extremely partisan views. My advice to the world is that we should practice detachment from the organizations and focus on the mission. And the mission is the health of the public. And so I think that focusing a lot of energy in trying to repair CDC is actually the wrong direction, because that damage has been done. And for me, the bottom line isn’t just that there’s no political will to fix it, it’s the opposite—there’s a strong political will to break it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing that we’re going to be able to do at this moment to resist the breaking of CDC. But what we can do is turn to local jurisdictions, states, and other professional organizations outside the federal government. They’re going to have to be the renaissance that will follow after the dark ages. I don’t know what that renaissance will look like, but I know it’s not going to come from the feds down. It’s going to come from the states, the jurisdictions, the organizations, and the people on the ground. Because there will be something that can be rebuilt or built up, but it’s not going to be out of the minds of the people who are literally trying to destroy public health.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

As a 2021 review of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/9/1/26/5998648?login=true" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;fever in the Covid-19 pandemic era&lt;/a&gt; put it: "blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defence against infection".   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Using medication to quell the impacts of fever can also have adverse effects at a population level. A 2014 study, for example, found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2570" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;suppressing fevers caused by the flu can lead to higher transmission rates&lt;/a&gt;. That's because if infected people simply treat their feverish symptoms, they soon resume their everyday activities, from work to socialising, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2570" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;spreading the disease further than if they felt the need to rest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the case of mild fevers, it's therefore better in some circumstances to let them do their job, says Perretti. Theoretically, he says, one could give the body 24 to 48 hours to perform the necessary inflammatory response. However, he warns, this could still be dangerous in some situations, so you should always consult your clinician, who can identify the best course of treatment for your specific scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Scientists are still working out when to treat fevers, and when to leave them alone. But the next time you have one, as the sweat drips from your body and the shivering sets in, take the opportunity to marvel at your immune system's efforts to protect you from further harm. It's been millennia in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="*-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-physician-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;* All content within this column is provided for general information only and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

                A new study found the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the U.S., called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, tended to have fewer side effects than some older medications.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that antidepressants come with side effects for cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a major analysis from a team of researchers in the U.K. has, for the first time, pulled together data from more than 150 clinical trials to compare the physical side effects of dozens of antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study,&lt;a href="https://info.thelancet.com/hubfs/Press%20embargo/Antidepressantsmeta.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;the Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this week, details how each medication can affect weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol and other areas of health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The end result is something akin to a "sports league table" for 30 different antidepressants based on their side effect profile, says lead author &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/toby-pillinger" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Toby Pillinger&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatrist at King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's never been done at this scale before and no one's ever put specific numbers to the amount of weight you'll put on, or to the amount that your cholesterol goes up," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings are based on existing data, mostly from 8-week drug studies, that altogether represent more than 58,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the U.S. — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5504044/ssri-antidepressant-withdrawal-side-effects" target="_blank"&gt;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825" target="_blank"&gt;SSRIs, like Zoloft and Prozac &lt;/a&gt;— tended to have fewer physical side effects, according to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other medications, particularly some of the older drugs, were shown to have more significant impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a person who took nortriptyline, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046983" target="_blank"&gt;a tricyclic antidepressant&lt;/a&gt;, could, on average, have an increase in heart rate that was 20 beats higher than the SSRI fluvoxamine. For other medications, the expected weight change could be four pounds gained, or lost.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pillinger says the intention is not to single out certain antidepressants as better than others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It may be that one medication which is pretty bad for one person actually is pretty good for another one. I think that is the message, rather than naming and shaming certain drugs," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pillinger hopes the data can help prescribers and their patients make individualized decisions about the best medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, he and his colleagues have created&lt;a href="https://www.psymatik.com/" target="_blank"&gt; a free digital tool &lt;/a&gt;that's already being used by clinicians all over the world to create a "menu" of options, based on a patient's underlying health and what side effects they'd most like to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/departments/psychiatry-and-behavioral-health/education/research-residency-track/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nina Kraguljac&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Ohio State University, who was not involved in the research, says the study was well-done — and largely reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What surprised me about this study is that side effects are not that severe," says Kraguljac, who is also chair of the American Psychiatric Association's council on research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, she stresses that "side effects alone should not guide a clinical decision," since the study's results ultimately reflect an average, not the individual patient.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Side effects do not happen in every patient and are not necessarily a reason to deter people from taking the medications," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study does have some notable limitations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though many people take these drugs for months or years, the data was largely from 8-week randomized controlled trials, which are the most common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And some prominent side effects — that cause some people to stop taking antidepressants — were not evaluated, says &lt;a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/david-j-hellerstein-md" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. David Hellerstein&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He points out the impact on sexual function, gastrointestinal issues, and "emotional blunting" — a sense that feelings are being muted — are all common complaints that weren't looked at.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Most of the side effects detailed in the study are already well-known, although he believes the work will still be "a useful touchstone" for patients and prescribers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Big picture, most of these drugs seem quite safe on a lot of physical parameters, especially the newer drugs, like the SSRIs and SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But for some groups of people, the side effects might be significant, he cautions, "and could affect what medicine the doctor would choose or what medicine a patient would prefer."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And he notes, side effects aren't always a downside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hellerstein has a patient who had lost a significant amount of weight due to depression, meaning an antidepressant that also led to some extra weight would actually be "healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say that is not a side effect. That is a benefit of treatment," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

The United Nations health agency has set a goal of &lt;a href="/news/2021/11/4/hpv-jabs-reduce-cervical-cancer-risk-by-up-to-87-percent-study"&gt;eradicating cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; globally by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the vaccine has met resistance in Pakistan, as conspiracy theories about inoculations have circulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is more about what HPV is, how it causes cervical cancer, and why the vaccine rollout in Pakistan has faced a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-hpv-and-what-are-the-symptoms"&gt;What is HPV and what are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is a common group of viruses that enter the body via skin-to-skin contact, typically through a cut or abrasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 100 types of HPV, and they are often spread through sexual contact.  Infection can be hard to identify because many people who have contracted an HPV have no symptoms at all, and it can take many years for cancer to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of the virus eventually cause warts on the genitals or other parts of the body. These may appear flat or bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-hpv-cause-cervical-cancer"&gt;How does HPV cause cervical cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 95 percent of the 660,000 cervical cancer cases recorded each year worldwide are caused by HPV, according to the WHO. In Pakistan, more than 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported every year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some strains of HPV can cause different types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, vulvar cancer or vaginal cancer. However, cervical cancer typically develops 20 years after the onset of the HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the body’s immune system can clear away many strains of HPV within two years of infection, certain strains are more persistent. When the body’s immune system is unable to fight off the more persistent HPV strains, the virus interferes with normal cell growth, causing cells to become abnormal and potentially leading to a pre-cancerous state. If this is left untreated, cancer can develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sufferers of cervical cancer do not experience symptoms in its early stages. Hence, women aged 30 to 65 are advised to have a pap smear every three years, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-have-vaccines-been-rolled-out-in-pakistan"&gt;How have vaccines been rolled out in Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s HPV vaccine campaign began on September 15. While the first phase was scheduled to run until September 27, it was later extended to October 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 49,000 government health workers – all women – have been trained by the WHO to administer the vaccines across the country. The WHO and Pakistan’s government partnered to conduct this training with funding support from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, a public-private partnership that works to improve access to immunisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advance of the first phase, vaccine centres were set up in public buildings such as schools. Health workers also went door-to-door to administer the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single dose of Cecolin, an HPV vaccine developed in China, was administered free of charge. While most HPV vaccines require either two or three doses, WHO confirmed in October last year that Cecolin could be used as a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the rollout in Pakistan, girls between the ages of nine and 14 from Sindh, Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the Islamabad Capital Territory received the single-dose vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_4054542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4054542" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4054542" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ap_68f9d3885bba6-1761203080.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="A health worker gives an injection of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to a girl during a campaign aiming to protect girls from cervical cancer, at a school in Lahore, Pakistan, Monday, Sept. 22, 2025.

Do not fall prey to negative campaigns. This vaccine is safe, effective and essential for protecting our girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamal told Al Jazeera that when the vaccine campaign started, there was a lot of criticism and scepticism towards it. “A few unknown people had spread some fake videos and fake information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that during the first four days of the campaign, the response to the vaccine was negative. “The refusals were very high, so much so that there are schools which had committed before [to serve as vaccination centres], but refused our workers entry into the school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day, Kamal got his own daughter publicly vaccinated during a ceremony at the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) office in Karachi. During the event, Kamal told journalists: “I have never brought my family into the public eye in my 30-year political career. But to put an end to these baseless rumours, I have taken this step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that after this, the refusals went down and acceptances went up. He added that this upward trend of acceptance and vaccine administration continued till the end of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was noticed that after clarifying rumours, people started to get vaccine. Especially, schools were requesting to send teams as parents were agreeing to get their daughters vaccinated,” Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, the health minister of Sindh province, told Al Jazeera in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial reluctance is why, she said, the vaccination campaign was extended by four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-cecolin"&gt;What is Cecolin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cecolin vaccine does not contain the live HPV virus. Instead, it contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins, laboratory-made proteins that mimic the outer shell of the virus but do not have any viral DNA and therefore cannot cause infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other countries have used the US-manufactured Gardasil HPV vaccine, which also does not contain the live HPV virus and contains recombinant L1 capsid proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-the-vaccine-only-being-given-to-girls-aged-nine-to-14"&gt;Why is the vaccine only being given to girls aged nine to 14?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government says that this particular age group of girls was selected per the recommendations of the WHO’s National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), responsible for providing evidence-based recommendations for immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As per WHO, the immune response generated by the body after the vaccine jab is maximum at this age of 9-14 years, and the child gets the best and long-term protection. Hence, this particular age group,” Pechuho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, the vaccine is available free of cost for 9-14-year-old girls only. There have been talks at the federal ministry level to make this vaccine available commercially so others [boys, women and teenage girls, etc] can benefit, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-recipients-of-the-vaccine-say-about-it"&gt;What do recipients of the vaccine say about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Sana Ali Manzoor and her husband – who say they are strongly in favour of vaccinations for their children – took their 11-year-old daughter to be vaccinated at her private school campus in Karachi after school hours. The whole process took about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor said she heard about the vaccine rollout via a mobile application operated by her daughter’s school, Haque Academy, which is located in the upmarket neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority. Parents were invited to register on the mobile app and accompany their children for the vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor, a lactation specialist who supports new mothers, said approximately 30-40 other children were also present when her daughter received her vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we went to school, and there were two or three tables set up. The health workers were there. They first checked if our name was on the list. After that, we went and got the vaccination done. And then right after that, there was a manual card entry filling that was done, then they gave us the card.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described the process as “very organised”. Manzoor says she was encouraged by friends, including a paediatrician and a gynaecologist, to get the HPV vaccine for her daughter. She has also had her children vaccinated against chickenpox, which she travelled to Dubai to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-successful-has-the-vaccination-drive-been-so-far"&gt;How successful has the vaccination drive been so far?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rollout has not hit its target, authorities say — though they insist that despite this, the campaign counts as a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around 13 million girls were supposed to be vaccinated in the first phase of the HPV vaccine campaign. So far, 9.2 million have been vaccinated, which is 78 percent of the total target,” Pechuho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the southern province of Sindh, the estimated target for the HPV campaign was 4,081,279 girls. Sixty-six percent of the total target was reached, with 2,674,210 girls vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low take-up is down to a general hesitancy towards vaccines in Pakistani society, experts say. Compounding this, specific concerns about the HPV vaccine have been fuelled by misinformation, particularly online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="will-others-get-the-vaccine"&gt;Will others get the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine will eventually roll out to other provinces, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The government has not yet announced when the next phase will begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every age girl will be vaccinated periodically,” Kamal, the federal minister, said. He added that the government hopes to vaccinate boys and men against HPV once girls and women have been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-driving-vaccine-hesitancy-in-pakistan"&gt;What is driving vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vaccine hesitancy is a global phenomenon, in Pakistan it was aggravated by the CIA’s use of a fake hepatitis B vaccination campaign in Pakistan’s Abbottabad as cover for a manhunt for fugitive al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine campaign, carried out in collaboration with a local doctor, was used to covertly collect blood samples to find links to bin Laden and his family. The plan was to compare the DNA of any of bin Laden’s children to that of his sister, who had died in Boston in 2010. The al-Qaeda leader was eventually killed in a military operation in Abbottabad by US Marines in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was never revealed whether the CIA obtained any DNA from bin Laden’s family. However, news outlets at the time said that one source suggested the operation had not succeeded. In 2014, the White House promised that the CIA would never again use a false vaccination campaign for espionage. However, mistrust towards vaccines persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were free, but according to a recent study, 30 percent of people in Pakistan did not want to get vaccinated. An opinion piece, co-written by a Pakistani doctor and published on the website of GAVI, said: “Misconceptions that the [COVID] vaccine could lead to infertility, death or be tied into shadowy foreign agendas circulated rapidly through social media and community gossip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor said she has herself noticed “anti-vaxxer” sentiment among some of her clients. She recalled advising a young mother not to bring her unvaccinated newborn into her house, explaining that it is not a sterile environment. The young mother responded, “It’s fine, we don’t believe in such things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-specific-concerns-about-the-hpv-vaccine"&gt;What are the specific concerns about the HPV vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine has faced especially heated pushback in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some argue that, as HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, it is not required in Pakistan, where consensual sex before marriage is not only culturally frowned upon, but is also illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani user wrote on X, “Cerv. Cancer is spread via Sexual contact which is NOT IN PAKISTAN for 9-14 year old – only in west.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another user wrote, referring to the vaccine, “its common in societies where women has multiple sex partners!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzoor said that she had her daughter vaccinated because, to her, it made sense to ensure that her daughter remains safe from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not even about being sexually active, it’s even about, God forbid, molestation. It’s not always consensual,” Manzoor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Islamabad-based NGO Sahil reported that, on average, one child was sexually abused every two hours in Pakistan. According to the &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World Population Review&lt;/a&gt;, 5,867 rape cases were reported in Pakistan in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another conspiracy theory circulating online is that the HPV vaccine causes infertility. There is no evidence to support this claim. Pakistan, with a population in excess of 250 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, according to World Population Review. While &lt;a href="/features/2024/10/13/choosing-to-be-child-free-in-an-apocalyptic-south-asia"&gt;birthrates&lt;/a&gt; in the country have declined, much like the rest of the world, Pakistan’s current birthrate is 3.32, well above the replacement rate of 2.1 required to maintain current populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, a peer-reviewed US study found no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. However, this study was conducted in the US, and the sample was inoculated with a different vaccine – Gardasil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rumours, along with pictures and videos, have spread online. A video which attracted more than 340,000 views on X this year shows girls in school uniforms collapsing, with the caption asserting that these girls became sick after “forced vaccinations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the video was filmed last year and shows a scene in which police are clashing with protesters over electricity taxes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tear gas shells fired by the police are what caused the girls at the school to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-the-hpv-vaccine-safe"&gt;Is the HPV vaccine safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine has an excellent safety profile. It has been around for almost two decades now. It doesn’t contain any virus, but the active component is the HPV L1 protein,” Pechuho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an assessment of Cecolin published last year, the WHO said that “the vaccine was safe and showed a good immunogenicity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can cause a few mild side effects, Pechucho said. “Most common side effects are related to any other vaccine, like fever, pain at the injection site and, rarely, allergic reactions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamal too insisted that the most common side effect is a fever, which subsides in a day or two with the help of over-the-counter medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People used to die of diseases like polio and tuberculosis. They’re not dying today because we now have vaccines. People are not dying of COVID because we have vaccines. The world has moved to prevention,” Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The point of an effective healthcare system is to prevent people from becoming patients. And people will be safe from becoming patients when they take preventative measures and get their children vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 08:16:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPSzFfUXZzbFI2bTUwdWMtSi15YmhEMkp2QUVsdVk3YUNWSTRtcy1tZGZicUxhMzQzbXRZbVVYM3o3cWd5TEdJQ3V6aU00amlkNmc5bGVhMXdmdTlPek1wSkJwcVEzbms0THl6ck5lMmhObXYySWJmcXFqcFE0aVNQdzF0VXVrbHQtcUY5OEJ2MkdtQzIydmFUWkJ6bzFLQdIBowFBVV95cUxNdmROd0dNcnV5SHpTeXpxbnhMemdMYUotXzJEY19heUlKSnZmZnM0a25uaEF5ZWp4RDdyZkp0WW9UWm1yTHctQ2hQdG5EMFZBVFZYOWhkZmg5a0ozWmkxZWRxVnhYYWtzcXlYWVpGSndjN2E2d0g0WmpkVnpramEwc0RyVTlMNjlGdmNCRFBiVlZDWV9JdDZxM20wNEFRMVdiTE84</guid></item><item><title>“屁股呼吸”技术实际上可以帮助有肺部问题的人，科学家说-独立报</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/butt-breathing-method-lung-patients-ig-nobel-b2850602.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 bxpovR sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iBibVd"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 dDhojf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 cUJDWn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 jEZjIj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

rectally – one of the winners of the 2024 “Ig Nobel” satirical science prize – may one day actually help &lt;a href="/news/health/copd-ild-treatment-lung-disease-singing-benefits-b2835257.html"&gt;lung disease patients&lt;/a&gt;, after achieving a key step in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique was first demonstrated in 2021 by Japanese researchers, who showed in experimental &lt;a href="/news/science/pig-lungs-human-transplant-surgery-china-b2813923.html"&gt;pig models&lt;/a&gt; that oxygen could be delivered to the body via the rectum in gas form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enema-like process delivers &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://indy-cms-new-prod.brightsites.co.uk/article/edit/2849950"&gt;super-oxygenated liquid&lt;/a&gt; to the large intestine where the life-supporting gas is absorbed into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this method of rescuing people with blocked airways led the research team to win a parody award, it might not be a joke after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt; reports encouraging data from the first human clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefits of this “enteral ventilation” technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first human data, and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness,” Takanori Takebe, an author of the study from the University of Osaka, said. “Now that we’ve established tolerance, the next step will be to evaluate how effective the process is for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Efficacy of anal breathing method examined in mammals such as mice and pigs&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

– without it being oxygenated – for 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study evaluated the safety of this method in humans for the first time, using a special liquid called perfluorodecalin with exceptional oxygen-carrying ability,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 20 of them held the liquid for the entire hour, including amounts up to 1,500 ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the largest volumes, though, the participants reported feeling abdominal bloating and discomfort, but no serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a trial with 27 healthy male volunteers, the authors found that administering this liquid rectally was safe and well tolerated,” the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were hoping to repeat the experiment using oxygenated liquid to measure how much of it was needed and for how long to improve blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important safety milestone,” they concluded, “paves the way for future studies to see if this technique can help patients with respiratory failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 04:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSjRuelJUQmxJLVRuMFRMRGhPOFVfNEJyQ2RNZGhRNnNCcWtYWk5zVGhBN1hEdWQ0NUZJSVl4QW9WcktaX1dqbmFPMl83bjVvS3dfa1ppRi04SnNfUGhWQi1UTnUtVnVobDE5SkQyLU1HTEwwM3QtZndPeHRTSU9wcVZpVjJCREFmbW0tQ0psRHJ5a2ljbVBOZ1JuaDJHYWZyN1FR</guid></item><item><title>接种新冠肺炎mRNA疫苗的癌症患者生存期显著延长-彭博社</title><link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/covid-mrna-vaccine-found-to-enhance-response-to-cancer-immunotherapy</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content"&gt;&lt;p class="ArticleBodyText_articleBodyContent__17wqE typography_articleBody__3UcBa" data-component="paragraph"&gt;The same &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/" title="Link to Nobel Press Release" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="media-ui-Link_link-tVkXhPLPofs-" data-component="link"&gt;Nobel-winning&lt;/a&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Reducing cholesterol levels might not just be good for your heart; they might also be effective at reducing your risk of dementia, according to a comprehensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="177959" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; involving close to a million participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results imply that medications commonly taken to reduce cholesterol levels, including statins and ezetimibe, may also have benefits for our cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from the University of Bristol in the UK and the Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark, the study builds on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/statins-could-reduce-dementia-risk-even-in-people-with-low-cholesterol"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; linking 'bad' cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or LDL-C) and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-you-make-your-coffee-could-affect-your-cholesterol-levels"&gt;How You Make Your Coffee Could Affect Your Cholesterol Levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a new idea, but this latest research gives us one of the most detailed datasets and strongest pieces of evidence yet that the association exists – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;that treatments&lt;/a&gt; could potentially tackle both problems at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The present data suggests that cholesterol lowering earlier in life likely will reduce the risk of dementia later in life," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70638"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn't track people taking medication for high cholesterol. Instead, it used genetic variants that tend to lower cholesterol as a stand-in for a lifetime of taking drugs like statins – an approach known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian Randomization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderlyPeople.jpg" alt="Elderly people" class="wp-image-177962 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderlyPeople.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderlyPeople-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderlyPeople-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ElderlyPeople-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Around 57 million people are living with dementia worldwide.

That in turn could lead to brain damage, and we know that certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;types of dementia&lt;/a&gt; are driven by problems with the brain getting enough blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Astro" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to see  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="177959" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in which the cholesterol drugs can be administered and their brain-protective effects can be observed to confirm the link identified in this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be a really good next step to carry out randomized clinical trials over 10 or 30 years, for example, where you give the participants cholesterol-lowering medication and then look at the risk of developing dementia," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/october/cholesterol-dementia-study.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nordestgaard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70638"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pottstown, Pennsylvania&lt;/em&gt; — Illeana Casiano-Vazquez and her husband Sam cherish every minute together. Six years ago, she was diagnosed with triple-negative &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mammograms-breast-cancer-screening-questions-experts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an aggressive form of the cancer that has fewer treatment options and a higher rate of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first thing I thought about were my boys," Casiano-Vasquez told CBS News. "So, in the same feeling of, 'Oh my God, am I going to die?' sort of was this immediate like, 'I'm not going to die.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy and a double mastectomy eliminated signs of cancer. But naturally, she is still worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mental struggle that comes with the fear of recurrence is real and strong," Casiano-Vazquez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angela DeMichele, Casiano-Vazquez's oncologist and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, told CBS News that Casiano-Vazquez had a 25% chance that the breast cancer would come back within five years. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeMichele co-leads a team at Penn conducting a clinical trial that identifies and targets breast cancer "sleeper cells," which are cells that break away from the main tumor and can resurface later to spread cancer throughout the body. They &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03877-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published their results&lt;/a&gt; last month in the scientific journal Nature Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way that we follow patients, we are not going to, right now, find the cancer until it's already found its way to another part of the body, and by that time it's incurable," DeMichele explains. "So our goal was to find a way to identify the cells that actually were lurking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were sleeper cells in Casiano-Vazquez's bone marrow, so DeMichele gave her drugs to attack the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeMichele said that after six months of treatments, doctors were "so thrilled we could no longer see these dormant cells in her bone marrow." &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 51 women in the Penn School of Medicine trial. After seven years, only two people saw the cancer come back, far below the expected rate, according to DeMichele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next steps are to take this to larger trials to confirm this, and then to really see if this could also apply to other cancers," DeMichele said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casiano-Vazquez counts herself incredibly fortunate to have time with her now-teenage boys and their family rock band. She's now part of a follow-up study at Penn.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only chance I have is if this clinical trial continues to work," Casiano-Vazquez said. "It's a chance that other women have, to give them hope that it won't come back."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

                A cloud of smog hovers above Lebanon's capital Beirut on August 14, 2025. Air pollution from diesel generators and smokey tailpipes are among the reasons that cancer is surging in Lebanon.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/about/people/ali-mokdad" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali Mokdad&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands in the heart of Beirut. Cars and trucks and motorcycles rumble everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you look at a car passing by, you see smoke coming out of it — that's illegal in Lebanon. But nobody enforce[s] it," says Mokda, the chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, Beirut has terrible air quality and is often submerged under a blanket of exhaust. And it's not just in the big cities — vehicles belch pollution across the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's one reason that cancer is surging in Lebanon. Mokdad co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01635-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a global survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that revealed that the tiny nation on the Mediterranean is experiencing the fastest increase in cancer incidence and mortality anywhere in the world. According to the study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, the frequency of new cancer cases in Lebanon has increased by an astounding 162% from 1990 to 2023, with cancer-related deaths increasing by 80% over that same period. In 2023, for every 100,000 people in the country, there were 233.5 new cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The news is sobering elsewhere too. The survey predicts that cancer cases and cancer deaths will continue to rise worldwide through at least 2050, especially in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Lebanon has reason to be especially alarmed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's behind the dramatic rise in cancer in Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mokdad grew up in Lebanon before moving abroad almost 40 years ago. For him, like many here, the disease is personal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm losing cousins," he says. "I'm scared. I'm losing them at a very young age. It's not only death. It's also diseases. They have so many health problems."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94534" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;There are various reasons why cancer is surging in Lebanon. A big one is air pollution from both vehicles and diesel-fueled generators that many homes and businesses use due to unreliable state electricity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition, "we overuse chemicals for our agriculture," says Mokdad. Some of these compounds along with sewage ends up in certain rivers. "People don't drink it but they wash their tabbouleh and their fattoush with it. They're consuming this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By far the biggest risk factor, however, is smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is no more taboo about smoking," Mokdad says. "Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's gotten to the point where Mokdad keeps a set of clothes in Lebanon that he only wears there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are no public health campaigns warning against the dangers of smoking or secondhand smoke. Instead, Mokdad says &lt;a href="https://www.regie.com.lb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the government&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is actually in the business of &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccotactics.org/article/lebanon-country-profile/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;buying and selling tobacco&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The inevitable result is that lung cancer rates have jumped nationwide. In addition, leukemia and pancreatic and liver cancers have risen. The increases in prostate, colon and breast cancers are all preventable through early screening and detection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The issue, says Mokdad, is that although screening is available, most people don't know to seek it out. "Health education is a problem," he explains. "If you caught [cancer] earlier," people wouldn't have to die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The global survey on cancer and Lebanon's troubling trends with the disease caught the attention of members of the Lebanese parliament. It's why they invited Mokdad to come talk to lawmakers and experts about his findings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change will be a journey, a slow one at that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Mokdad traveled to Beirut for the meeting, which was held inside one of the Parliament buildings. After walking through the results of the study and describing the peril that cancer poses, Mokdad suggested to the officials that Lebanon could improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch a set of aggressive anti-tobacco ads. By way of example, he pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFQ6YoDAoeY" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public health campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. a decade ago, one that the CDC and other researchers say prevented &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(20)30468-2/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;129,100 early deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between 2012 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94530" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Ali Mokdad briefs lawmakers about his report which shows how serious the frequency of cancer is in Lebanon. He tells lawmakers the country needs to improve its health screening, ban smoking in public spaces and launch an aggressive anti-tobacco campaign.  "Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? "

   &lt;p&gt;Inaya Ezzeddine is a member of parliament and a physician who ran the proceedings. She explains that any kind of government response will take time. "It's a journey," she says. "It's not something that we can implement overnight because it has to do with a lot of sectors. We have to work hard toward this political will."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A committee will be formed to examine the data and determine which laws will need enacting or strengthening to address the problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the attendees, &lt;a href="https://aub.edu.lb/pages/profile.aspx?memberID=nuwayhid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iman Nuwayhid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of public health at the American University of Beirut, believes that individuals should take responsibility too. "We're accountable to making our country cleaner, reduce pollution, improve the environment," he says. "Of course, the government plays a bigger role, but we have a big responsibility. Local communities again should push in that direction."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mokdad argues that the time is now for the government to act and support people in making the right decisions about their health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I know Lebanese have to deal with a lot of things," he says. "But cancer is killing. Many people in the parliament said, 'I'm not surprised with this finding.' And my question: What are you doing about it? Why have you been waiting so long to take action?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A couple blocks from the building where the meeting was held, a mother and son are seated outside, taking a break from work.

   &lt;p&gt;She says she's recently lost several loved ones to cancer — her mother, her sister and a close friend. "It's very dangerous and I'm afraid of it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mourda is hopeful that the government will do something, even while acknowledging that she shouldn't be smoking. She knows it's bad for her. She's tried to stop but hasn't been able to kick the habit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her son, Marwan Bizri, looks on. "Lebanese people are dying because of cancer," he says. "We're losing people we love."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Julia Beverly/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE SCIENTISTS GATHERING INSIDE a cavernous convention hall here this week weren’t chanting or carrying protest signs or wearing frog costumes. But over the course of four days, they engaged in what felt like their own brand of political resistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were there for IDWeek, the annual gathering of professional societies that work on infectious diseases. And in many ways the meeting was like any other medical conference. Participants attended mostly narrow, technical lectures on topics like tuberculosis, HIV, and tropical diseases—one session had the title of “Big Beasts of Clinical Mycology”—with occasional breaks for networking at receptions and strolling among the vendors in the exhibit hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the meeting at the Georgia World Congress Center, which goes four stories down into the side of the hill, so that riding the escalators down was a bit like entering a concrete bunker. And that felt fitting, given the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was the first IDWeek gathering of Donald Trump’s second presidency, meaning it was the first since Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary—launched his assault on federal public health institutions. That includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose Atlanta headquarters are just a few miles away and where there are still bullet dimples in the walls from the August assault by a gunman &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0y796qqp9o" rel&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was impossible to miss, attendees told me, and it started with who was there—or, more accurately, who was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC staff traditionally attend IDWeek in large numbers, to present and to learn—and to make connections for future collaborations, including in a potential crisis. A year ago, when the Atlanta location for this year’s meeting was announced, everybody assumed CDC attendance would be higher than usual because it would be almost literally down the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no CDC staff were present in their official capacity this week. The immediate reason was the federal shutdown, which includes government-wide rules forbidding conduct of most normal business. But several former officials who were at the meeting told me the agency’s new political leaders had made clear long before the shutdown that they would be dramatically limiting attendance and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS officials did not confirm that, or (yet again) respond to my queries for this article. But scaling back CDC participation in the conference would be consistent with Kennedy’s contempt both for expertise and for experts—and with the way he has treated the CDC more generally, through a series of cuts, firings, and forced resignations that have effectively wiped out whole divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason I came to Atlanta this week was to get a better sense of just how big a toll Kennedy’s actions had taken. The answers I got were not exactly encouraging. The attendees I met (along with some CDC veterans I reached separately) painted a picture of an agency that is struggling to carry out some basic operations, and in which scientists are subject to a level of political control that goes well beyond anything in CDC history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of this devastation, however, something quite unique to the scientific community has arisen: a coordinated effort to step into the void the CDC is leaving, as a source of information the public can trust. Nobody thinks these efforts can come close to making up for what the CDC is no longer doing. But there was a discernible sense that the effort itself has value—that by taking action the scientists were making clear not only their determination to call out the administration’s attacks, but to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE FIRST STEP in pushing back against the administration has been to catalogue the damage it has done. But that is proving a difficult task, because HHS has not published detailed lists of who’s gone and who’s left—or how many have departed. Making things even more difficult is the ambiguous status of many employees, since pending lawsuits have blocked some layoffs and a number of people are on forced administrative leave, being paid but not actually at work or doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And all of that is separate from the government shutdown, which has most of the agency’s workers on furlough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best estimates come from crowdsourcing efforts by former employees. Acting through existing or new groups, they’ve combined what they’re hearing from old colleagues along with information from unions. And based on that, it looks like the CDC has effectively &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/as-more-layoffs-hit-the-cdc-atlanta-braces-for-the-effects/" rel&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; between a fourth and a third of the roughly 12,000 people who were working there as of January, according to Barbara Marston, who retired from the CDC in 2022 and is coordinating a network of former staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These losses are scattered across the agency, IDWeek attendees told me—sometimes in ways that reflect obvious ideological motives, like the shuttering or hollowing out of offices that deal with equity or LGBTQ issues, but sometimes in ways that don’t appear to have any particular logic other than an imperative to cut staffing levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’d describe the CDC as Swiss cheese, with holes throughout it, or maybe Jenga, where you’ve built it up and then taken out a whole bunch of blocks,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/events-and-meetings/policy-action-institute/speakers/abigail-tighe" rel&gt;Abigail Tighe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, founding member of a group of former CDC employees called the National Public Health Coalition, told me. “We are not tipping over yet, but we are very close, in a couple of different ways.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about the cuts and their effects is to think about the types of personnel who have been lost. And one underappreciated category, attendees told me, were staff in departments like human resources or accounting whose positions might have looked ancillary or less essential to Trump administration budget cutters, but whose day-to-day work is essential for an agency that has to award and manage grants—or dispatch personnel to work with cities and states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there are the changes at the very top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;JIM O’NEILL, THE ACTING CDC DIRECTOR who &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/jim-oneill-cdc-acting-director/" rel&gt;took over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; after Kennedy forced out Susan Monarez, is believed to be the first non-scientist to head up the agency, even on a temporary basis. But more disturbing to some of the attendees I met was the fact that the other senior members of the agency director’s office—typically about ten in all—appear to be mostly or all political appointees, rather than career officials, as in the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When I was in the CDC Office of the Director, there was one political appointee—and that was the director,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eseanetwork.org/sched/E21/presenter/kathleen-ethier" rel&gt;Kathleen Ethier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a twenty-six-year CDC veteran who left in January, told me. “Now I think—I can’t verify the number—but I think it’s about ten. As best as I can tell, there is no one in a leadership position at CDC who is not a political appointee.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attendees I met said it’s a clear sign of how science is now being driven by political agendas in ways that go well beyond anything they’ve seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One example, as pointed out to me by several at the conference, was new language on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html" rel&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; critical of “harm reduction,” a strategy that seeks to minimize ill effects of substance abuse (like the spread of bloodborne disease through dirty needles) without necessarily curbing drug-taking behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new language characterizes harm reduction as “efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm”—a description consistent with longstanding beliefs many conservatives hold but inconsistent with a large body of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/what-is-harm-reduction" rel&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; showing harm reduction can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-the-harm-reduction-model" rel&gt;improve health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/15/1123108839/controversial-harm-reduction-strategies-appear-to-slow-drug-deaths" rel&gt;save lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; without leading to greater drug use or discouraging treatment. Programs based on harm reduction, the site says, will be “deprioritize[d].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is on vaccines where the politicization of science has been most visible, thanks in part to Kennedy’s purging of the official advisory committee that makes immunization recommendations to the CDC director. And this is where outside scientists have most clearly taken the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, they even made a little news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It came from epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, who, along with former CDC director &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/rochelle-walensky-md-mph" rel&gt;Rochelle Walensky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, has been heading up the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/manuscript" rel&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—an initiative, backed by several foundations, to provide trusted information about vaccines both to the public at large and to scientists who have traditionally relied on the CDC’s analysis of data to guide their decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To carry out the latter effort, the Vaccine Integrity Project has spent the past few months conducting what is basically a giant literature review of published evidence on the efficacy and safety of reliable vaccines. During Sunday’s opening session, in a conversation on the main stage, Osterholm announced the review was complete and under consideration at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;—where, he said, he hoped it would get quick approval.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This would be a big deal, given the number of medical societies and states that have said they will be making their own vaccine recommendations because they can no longer rely on the CDC. To make those recommendations, these states and societies need reliable analysis of the underlying research. If the Vaccine Integrity Project’s analysis gets the imprimatur of a publication as widely respected as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, states and medical societies will be able to trust it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’re not trying to be an ACIP in the shadows, we can’t do that,” Osterholm, coauthor of a new book on pandemics called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/wake-covid-osterholm-takes-big-one-new-book" rel&gt;The Big One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, told me. “But we said we need this scientific information out there, so that other people and organizations can make sound judgments and recommendations, and took it upon ourselves to do that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort that went into the analysis is impressive: A team of scientists started with abstracts of more than 17,000 academic references, then began whittling down the papers to the most relevant and reliable—subjecting each smaller group to more scrutiny—until finally they had about 500 to study carefully, and present as a new evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, Walensky told me, they approached about eight researchers to do the work. It ultimately took about twenty-five, she said, all working on their own time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People were doing this outside of their day job, just to get the data out there,” said Walensky, an infectious disease specialist now back at Harvard Medical School after having led the CDC for two and a half years under President Biden. “So many people were like, ‘I don’t know what to do, but I’m feeling at this moment like I need to help the country.’ And so while we were all working these ridiculous hours, I think we all felt like we were doing something important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE VACCINE INTEGRITY PROJECT is just one of several likeminded efforts—from groups like the National Public Health Coalition, which originally called itself “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://firedbutfighting.org/" rel&gt;Fired but Fighting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” to efforts from established outside organizations like the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cspi.org" rel&gt;Center for Science and the Public Interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which has started producing a blog called “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cspi.org/cspi-news/straight-shot-federal-vaccine-updates-oct-15-2025" rel&gt;The Straight Shot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” that provides updates and fact-checks on changes to federal vaccine policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then there is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/washington-watch/washington-watch/117996" rel&gt;CDC Alumni and Friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which had been operating as a more casual social and civic organization until this year. Now it’s a full-blown activist group that—in addition to holding press conferences and helping crowdsource information about personnel—has led rallies outside CDC headquarters, in order to show solidarity with the workers still inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Every Tuesday afternoon they would be standing outside, forty or fifty of them, while everybody was getting fired—everything was being destroyed—and they were just out there, saying we love you, you do good work,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/health/havers-cdc-vaccines-kennedy.html" rel&gt;Fiona Havers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a top agency expert on vaccines who left in June, told me. “It really meant a lot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nobody thinks these efforts can come close to filling all the gaps left by the cuts at the CDC. And none of the attendees I met thought rebuilding trust with skeptical members of the public would be easy. They remained concerned about how their startup initiatives could reach people who get information through TikTok and Facebook, not CNN or the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, especially when competing against the bully pulpit enjoyed by Kennedy and his legions of MAHA influencers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM" class="captioned-button-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="preamble"&gt;&lt;p class="cta-caption"&gt;Pop this newsletter into a friend’s inbox or post it to social media:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share"}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSTERHOLM’S CONVERSATION was the final part of the opening plenary. It followed what was the emotional high point of opening day—and maybe the whole event—when infectious disease specialist Demetre Daskalakis received an award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The award was for his years of work on HIV. But the standing ovation he got was for his high-profile resignation from a senior CDC post after Kennedy’s firing of Monarez—and the high-profile commentary he’s given since (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-cdc-purge-anti-vaccination" rel&gt;including here at &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-cdc-purge-anti-vaccination" rel&gt;The Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;) about the threats Kennedy’s changes pose to public health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis used his acceptance speech to fire up the crowd, urging attendees to follow his example and use their voices—as individuals, as practitioners, and as parts of a larger organization—to make the case for scientifically sound practices and for agencies like the CDC that, whatever their flaws, do essential work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy isn’t as strange for infectious-disease specialists as it might be for some other scientific disciplines. That’s especially true for those who got their start back in the 1980s, fighting for AIDS patients at a time when the president wouldn’t even say the name of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this time it’s the scientists—and their science—under assault. That’s new. It requires a level of engagement that goes beyond anything this community has done before. And at the end of the day, they are still doctors and researchers, more at ease fighting microbes than a political movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days after Daskalakis got his award and spoke, with the conference more than half over, I asked him how he thought the meeting compared to past versions—and what kind of mood he was detecting from the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think everyone is still experiencing shock and awe from all of the things that are happening to public health,” he said. “But I feel like people know that we’re in it for the long haul. And they know it’s not going to be an easy long haul, or a good long haul—that people’s careers are gonna be affected and people’s lives are gonna be affected—but that we can come out the other side with something that’s more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/cdc-diaspora-fights-back-public-health/comments" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:24:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE51b0FrV214UFc5M1NhYXRNMERod0ZIdFh5NzlqUEQzYk1WcVUwUlBoYWNiZFI2SWs5VjRxQW55dGhzQzRjZ2xMUEkwTDliRmNPYXVlUTRaLUIyckFvcHU2aWxzYmVpejdINGg3ZDJlRGhKbmVtR1E</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，您的麸质敏感性可能完全是另一回事- The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/your-gluten-sensitivity-might-be-something-else-entirely-new-study-shows-267098</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media and lifestyle magazines have turned gluten – a protein in wheat, rye and barley – into a dietary villain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/novak-djokovic-gluten-free-diet"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/food/pictures/celebrities-who-follow-gluten-free-diets/"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have promoted gluten-free eating as the secret to better health and performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;review in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; published today challenges that idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining decades of research, we found that for most people who think they react to gluten, gluten itself is rarely the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms but not coeliac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease is when the body’s immune system attacks itself when someone eats gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But people with gut or other symptoms after eating foods containing gluten can test &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; for coeliac disease or wheat allergy. They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we did and what we found&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were “gluten sensitive” reacted equally – or more strongly – to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn’t have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests most people who feel unwell after eating gluten are sensitive to something else. This could be FODMAPs such as fructans, or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can 
sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn’t mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there’s no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;optimise the quality of someone’s overall diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured re-introduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn’t explain someone’s symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That’s because expectation, stress and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic “gluten is bad” narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

The other half were given a dummy drug, known as a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous analysis of the data found that semaglutide reduced the risk of major adverse cardiac events by 20%. Researchers have now found the benefit was apparent regardless of how much weight people lost while taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Academics said the findings suggested there were multiple ways the drug could benefit the heart, rather than the protective effect achieved solely by weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that even people who were only mildly overweight, with a body mass index (BMI) score of 27 – the average BMI score for UK adults – experienced similar benefits to those who had the highest BMI scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The benefits were also largely independent of how much weight people lost in the first four months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, researchers did notice a difference between shrinking waistlines, measured by waist circumference, and heart benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, they said that an “estimated 33% of the observed benefit on major adverse cardiovascular events was mediated through waist circumference reduction”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author, Prof John Deanfield, of UCL’s Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: “Abdominal fat is more dangerous for our cardiovascular health than overall weight and therefore it is not surprising to see a link between reduction in waist size and cardiovascular benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“However, this still leaves two-thirds of the heart benefits of semaglutide unexplained. These findings reframe what we think this medication is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is labelled as a weight-loss jab but its benefits for the heart are not directly related to the amount of weight lost – in fact, it is a drug that directly affects heart disease and other diseases of ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added: “This work has implications for how semaglutide is used in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You don’t have to lose a lot of weight and you don’t need a high BMI to gain cardiovascular benefit. If your aim is to reduce cardiovascular disease, restricting its use to a limited time only and for those with the highest BMIs doesn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the same time, the benefits need to be weighed against potential side-effects. Investigations of side-effects become especially important given the broad range of people this medicine and others like it could help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxQdVZrendnOG9tUUJ0cDdNZVNwWnEweTZvSXo0NEpmVXpOSHh3S3FqOHBnckZRRUdXSTNuc0lqSnNINVJyU25TQ3hKYmxpUEgwekdzTGlnM2pudXJNSlQtdnRmUDBpaVV5MFV3UGhzeG5lT2hTQ1pzQ0docktyN2h0RnIwSExQbEhUNktkTzZjYUlRMzI3cVV6bUI5aVRKSHpkVG8yeGpuYnJ4Tl8zekV6dDBsdkpJdk52STV0aTNaYmhKYXBQMlVIMVA4Zw</guid></item><item><title>想让医生远离吗？新的人工智能研究揭示了“每天五个”的秘密- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/want-to-keep-the-doctor-away-new-ai-study-reveals-the-five-every-day-secret/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 22:28:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUG5SVndyQXlfNURmZW9YNUhKMlpreGxJSGFLVmpVaVJORjZZNG9kd0FOS3BHRElmWGh2ZVZ2SU1HTjhzQUdaX2lXVy0wZTMzNE80QjQtT0toVVNQNFdJUHktSnE1Vjg0STJKeDNoZGItekp3TWJ5bEJGZWh4YmptcW5TWGpCaVVwa1otcHpRbjBEOUltNmxoS1V6czQxcHpnSXpj</guid></item><item><title>90 ％的美国人面临着他们从未听说过的疾病的风险-金钱谈话新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic-syndrome/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 20:58:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1sQTlDbVFLOHRHMF9QTnBJYkR2MWdYcXdRNW1zVVBjSDB3dE45ZDlqUHdDenJOZnR2OFFRRUpLVEstUDk0Yl82WXY0bmFBV1dmTERualE4OTZXX1ZrVWFCcENoYXk1TEpzdTN1R0ZCTTh4TXlXWm1PNkpsZDk</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，牙龈疾病可能与中风和脑损伤的风险增加有关- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gum-disease-increased-risk-stroke-brain-damage-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping your mouth healthy may help keep your heart and brain healthy too, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in Neurology Open Access, researchers found adults with gum disease may be more likely to have signs of damage to the brain's white matter than people without gum disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gum disease is associated with a higher chance of inflammation, and inflammation has been tied to atherosclerosis as well as hardening of the small blood vessels, as we saw in this study," study author Dr. Souvik Sen told CBS News. Arteriosclerosis is a disease that causes abnormal thickening of the artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000036" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; led by Sen and published in the same journal Wednesday, researchers found having both gum disease and cavities is linked to an 86% increased risk of stroke compared to people with healthy mouths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What the study suggested was that if you have cavities on top of gum disease, it is double trouble. It means your risk of stroke or adverse heart event doubles," Sen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if someone takes care of their mouth — including brushing, flossing and regular dentist visits for preventative cleaning — risk decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their risk of having a stroke dropped by as much as 81%, which is a very big finding," Sen said of the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research just shows an association, so it does not prove that poor oral health causes strokes — but these findings add to growing evidence that oral health may have a significant impact on cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/18-11-2022-who-highlights-oral-health-neglect-affecting-nearly-half-of-the-world-s-population" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;3.5 billion people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide suffering from gum disease or cavities, according to the World Health Organization, researchers say prevention and treatment could be an important part of stroke prevention. According to the American Heart Association, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more than 795,000 people&lt;/a&gt; have a stroke each year in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

Using advanced genetic and metabolic profiling, researchers revealed that saliva from MS patients also had lower levels of hypotaurine, a molecule that supports antioxidant defense and nerve health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial and metabolic differences suggest that oral bacteria may contribute to immune dysregulation in MS. The findings could pave the way for simple saliva-based diagnostic tools and new treatments that restore healthy bacterial communities to support neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Oral Microbiome:&lt;/strong&gt; MS patients showed reduced levels of beneficial bacteria and increased inflammatory microbes in saliva.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower levels of hypotaurine, a protective metabolite, were linked to nerve health and antioxidant function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Saliva tests may one day help diagnose or monitor MS, and restoring healthy oral bacteria could become a therapeutic strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Iowa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With ads everywhere for pro- or pre-biotic foods and supplements, most people are familiar with the gut microbiome—the trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that colonize our digestive tract—and the idea that keeping our gut microbiome healthy improves our overall health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other areas of our bodies harbor their own unique microbiomes as well, and researchers are now starting to explore the role these microbial ecosystems play in health and disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Iowa Health Care researchers have produced the most comprehensive genetic and metabolic analysis to date of the oral microbiome associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), a progressive autoimmune disease that damages nerves in the brain and spinal cord. They found that people with MS have a distinct (dysbiotic) oral microbiome compared to healthy individuals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the gut microbiome has long been linked to MS, the oral microbiome, our mouth’s rich microbial ecosystem, has received far less attention, even though it’s the second most diverse microbiome in the human body and has been linked with other neurological diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, and inflammatory diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis,” says Ashutosh Mangalam, PhD, UI professor of pathology and senior author of the new study, which recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Bioflims and Microbiomes&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your mouth may reveal more about your overall health than you think,” he adds. “Our study shows that people with MS have measurable differences in the bacteria and metabolites found in their saliva. And this isn’t just about losing a few good bacteria; it suggests a there is a breakdown of the oral ecosystem in people with MS.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are treatments that can slow down MS, which causes muscle weakness, balance issues, and problems with vision and thinking, there is currently no cure for MS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge gleaned from the new study could eventually help doctors develop simple saliva-based tests to detect or monitor MS and may open the door to new classes of MS treatments that replace or restore healthy bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MS characterized by loss of good bacteria, enrichment of bad bacteria &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangalam and his team used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to study how changes to the entire community of bacteria in the mouth and small molecules (metabolites) these organisms produce might influence MS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed saliva from 50 people with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), the most common form of MS, and from 50 healthy controls. Compared to healthy people, individuals with MS had a disrupted oral microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance was primarily characterized by a loss of beneficial “early colonizer” bacteria, such as Streptococcus and Actinomyces that are the building blocks of a healthy oral community, and an increase in bacteria with the potential to cause disease, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and several Prevotella species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic profile of the saliva, a measure of the small molecules (metabolites) produced by both patient and bacteria, was also distinct. People with MS had reduced levels of a protective metabolite called hypotaurine, which is involved in antioxidant defense and nerve health. The study suggests that the decreased hypotaurine levels are likely linked to the altered bacteria in the MS oral microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that oral microbial and metabolic changes may contribute to inflammation and disease processes in MS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed a novel machine-learning approach called topic modeling that allowed them to identify groups of bacteria that coexist as communities. This analysis uncovered microbial networks that are unique to healthy individuals and showed that five microbial communities were significantly lost in MS patients. This loss suggests a fundamental breakdown in the cooperative microbial network that maintains oral health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This multi-omics approach revealed how bacterial composition, function, and metabolite profiles are interconnected, highlighting specific bacterial taxa and metabolic signatures that may shape inflammation and immune dysregulation in MS,” Mangalam says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings provide one of the most detailed views to date of the relationship between oral microbes, bacterial function, and host metabolism in MS. The results expand our understanding of MS beyond the gut and brain and highlight the mouth as another important site of immune-microbial interaction.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral microbiome offers opportunities for new diagnostics, therapies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings could lead to better ways to diagnose, monitor, and even treat MS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because saliva collection is simple and non-invasive, the oral microbiome and metabolome could become valuable biomarkers for monitoring disease activity or response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, microbiome profiling could be used to create a diagnostic signature for MS, and measuring hypotaurine levels in saliva could be simple, non-invasive biomarker to aid in diagnosis or disease monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, since the oral microbiome is easier to access and manipulate than the gut microbiome, the findings could open the door to a new class of MS treatments that replace or restore healthy bacteria to improve disease management and patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary research team included scientists from the UI Carver College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Public Health, College of Nursing, and Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. In addition to Mangalam, the team included Rachel Fitzjerrells, lead author and a graduate student in Mangalam’s lab, Leeann Aguilar Meza, Meeta Yadav, Heena Olalde, Mishelle Paullus, Jemmie Hoang, Catherine Cherwin, Tracey Cho, Grant Brown, and Sukirth M.

This microbial imbalance, or dysbiosis, may contribute to immune dysfunction that worsens MS symptoms and progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761165021451"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did the study reveal about saliva biomarkers and multiple sclerosis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The study identified unique saliva biomarkers in people with MS, including reduced levels of the protective molecule hypotaurine, which supports nerve health and antioxidant defense. These findings suggest that simple saliva tests could one day help detect or monitor MS activity based on metabolic and microbial signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761165038330"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why are oral bacteria important for understanding inflammation in MS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The mouth hosts one of the body’s most complex microbial ecosystems, and this study shows it plays a key role in systemic inflammation linked to multiple sclerosis. By mapping how oral bacteria interact with immune and metabolic pathways, scientists are uncovering how microbial imbalances in the mouth may influence the brain and nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#58323d3636313e3d2a7534753a2a372f36182d31372f39763d3c2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jennifer Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="ttps://uiowa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Iowa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jennifer Brown – University of Iowa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-025-00787-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multiple sclerosis patients exhibit oral dysbiosis with decreased early colonizers and lower hypotaurine level&lt;/a&gt;” by Ashutosh Mangalam et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Biofilms and Microbiomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple sclerosis patients exhibit oral dysbiosis with decreased early colonizers and lower hypotaurine level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although gut microbiome dysbiosis is implicated in the pathobiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), the role of the oral microbiome (OM), the second largest microbiome, remains poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the salivary metabolome has been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases; its role in people with Relapsing-Remitting MS (pwRRMS), the most prevalent form of MS, is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining shotgun metagenomics with untargeted metabolomics, we identified a reduced abundance of several early colonizing species including &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Actinomyces&lt;/em&gt; in pwRRMS and an enrichment of bacteria with pathogenic potential including &lt;em&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and several &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt; species. pwRRMS had an altered metabolite profile including a decreased hypotaurine compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus we report altered oral microbiome and metabolome in pwRRMS which might contribute to MS pathobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer potential microbiome-metabolome based diagnostic biomarkers for MS and pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions to improve disease management and patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 20:45:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE82bkN6Wk9PdFFoQ1VlLXpadFcyZDJMaFNiZWlJVnhMX0tITkstS1hEQmlvemR2b1VCNHBmZElySnMzZnlJaXNGMFBUZHVJWTRVQ2hZZU9LQkwzYTNiaDZNSDYxOWd2R2NEbGpIQnNnc2xkd2Vib1A5RGJ3</guid></item><item><title>曾经有希望的抗炎药物未能在试验中改善长期COVID功能结果- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/once-promising-anti-inflammatory-drug-fails-improve-long-covid-functional-outcomes-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A randomized clinical &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2840468"&gt;&lt;span&gt;trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; finds that the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine, once thought &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/news-scan-jun-24-2020"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt; for treating COVID-19, is no better than placebo in terms of functional capacity, respiratory function, symptoms such as depression or fatigue, or inflammation in long-COVID patients 1 year after infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-blind trial, led by researchers at the George Institute for Global Health India in Delhi, randomly assigned 346 adult long-COVID patients to 28 weeks of colchicine therapy (162 patients) or placebo (157) at eight hospitals in six states in India from January 2022 to July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants, who had functional limitations and/or elevated inflammatory markers, were evaluated 12, 26, and 52 weeks after randomization. Of the 346 participants, 60.4% were women, and the average age was 46 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colchicine is often used to reduce inflammation and pain in patients with gout, a buildup of uric-acid crystals in the joints, and is approved in the United States to treat inflammation in heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published this week in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alternative therapies needed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 35.0% of participants were hospitalized for their infections, 15 were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 4 needed mechanical ventilation.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The most common persistent symptoms were muscle pain (72.0%), breathlessness (63.0%), and insomnia (41.0%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this randomized clinical trial, among adults with long COVID, colchicine did not improve functional capacity, respiratory function, or inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 52 weeks, no difference was noted between colchicine and placebo recipients in average change in 6-minute walk test distance. Similar null results were observed for all studied outcomes, except for a modest, nonclinically relevant difference in pulmonary function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment effects didn't differ by body weight, hospitalization for COVID-19 infection, sex, or any underlying medical condition.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The rate of adverse events (AEs) was similar between the two groups (colchicine, 19.9%; placebo, 17.6%). Most AEs were mild or moderate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this randomized clinical trial, among adults with long COVID, colchicine did not improve functional capacity, respiratory function, or inflammatory markers," the study authors concluded. "These findings underscore the need to explore alternative therapeutic approaches for long COVID."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The study compared ketamine with a psychoactive placebo and found no meaningful differences in objective or self-reported depression scores, cognition, or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers caution that previous studies may have overestimated ketamine’s antidepressant efficacy due to unblinding and placebo effects. The findings emphasize the importance of rigorous trial design before adopting ketamine more widely for depression treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Added Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketamine did not outperform midazolam in reducing depression symptoms or improving quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placebo Effect Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; Most participants correctly guessed their treatment, possibly inflating perceived effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings call for recalibrating expectations about ketamine’s antidepressant potential and ensuring careful evaluation before clinical adoption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;TCD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings from a randomised and blinded clinical trial investigating repeated ketamine infusions for treating depression have revealed no extra benefit for ketamine when added onto standard care for people admitted to hospital for depression&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113511"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a syringe." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/ketamine-depression-placebo-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;No significant differences were found between the ketamine and midazolam groups on secondary outcomes for cognitive, economic or quality-of-life outcomes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KARMA-Dep (2) Trial involved researchers from St Patrick’s Mental Health Services, Trinity College Dublin, and Queens University Belfast, Ireland. It was led by Declan McLoughlin, Research Professor of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin and Consultant Psychiatrist at St Patrick’s Mental Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression has been recognised by the World Health Organization as a leading cause of disability globally.  According to the Health Research Board’s most recent report, there were 15,631 adult admissions to psychiatric services in Ireland in 2023. Similar to previous years, depressive disorders accounted for the highest proportion (about 24%) of all admissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that about 30% of people with depression do not respond sufficiently well to conventional antidepressants, which mostly target monoamine neurotransmitters, for example serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline.  There is thus a need for new treatments.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such novel treatment is the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine when given intravenously in low sub-anaesthetic doses. Ketamine works differently to other antidepressants and is believed to mediate its effects in the brain through the chemical messenger glutamate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single infusions of ketamine have been reported to produce rapid antidepressant effects, but these disappear within days. Nonetheless, ketamine is increasingly being adopted as an off-label treatment for depression even though the evidence to support this practice is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that repeated ketamine infusions may have more sustained benefit. However, this has so far been evaluated in only a small number of trials that have used an adequate control condition to mask the obvious dissociative effects of ketamine, e.g. altered consciousness and perceptions of oneself and one’s environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KARMA-Dep 2 is an investigator-led trial and was funded by the Health Research Board. The randomised trial was developed to assess antidepressant efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life during and after serial ketamine infusions when compared to a psychoactive comparison drug midazolam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial participants were randomised to receive up to eight infusions of either ketamine or midazolam, given over four weeks, in addition to all other aspects of usual inpatient care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial findings revealed that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no significant difference between the ketamine and midazolam groups at the end of the treatment course on the trial’s primary outcome, which was an objective measurement of depression. This was assessed with the commonly used Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of the treatment course on a subjective, patient-rated, scale for depression.  This was assessed with the commonly used Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Self-Report scale (QIDS-SR-16).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No significant differences were found between the ketamine and midazolam groups on secondary outcomes for cognitive, economic or quality-of-life outcomes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite best efforts to keep the trial patients and researchers blinded about the randomised treatment, the vast majority of patients and raters correctly guessed the treatment allocation. This could lead to enhanced placebo effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the impact of the findings, Declan McLoughlin, Research Professor of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin and Consultant Psychiatrist at St Patrick’s Mental Health Services, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our initial hypothesis was that repeated ketamine infusions for people hospitalised with depression would improve mood outcomes. However, we found this not to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Under rigorous clinical trial conditions, adjunctive ketamine provided no additional benefit to routine inpatient care during the initial treatment phase or the six-month follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous estimates of ketamine’s antidepressant efficacy may have been overstated, highlighting the need for recalibrated expectations in clinical practice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author of the study, Dr Ana Jelovac, Trinity College Dublin, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our trial highlights the importance of reporting the success, or lack thereof, of blinding in clinical trials. Especially in clinical trials of therapies where maintaining the blind is difficult, e.g. ketamine, psychedelics, brain stimulation therapies.  Such problems can lead to enhanced placebo effects and skewed trial results that can over-inflate real treatment effects.”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761155643074"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What was the goal of this study on ketamine and depression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The trial tested whether repeated low-dose ketamine infusions improve depression outcomes when added to standard inpatient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761155679238"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: There was no significant difference between patients receiving ketamine and those given a psychoactive placebo (midazolam) across all major depression and quality-of-life measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761155697181"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is this important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Despite growing off-label use of ketamine for depression, this rigorously blinded trial suggests its antidepressant benefits may have been overstated, underscoring the need for more cautious clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761155718137"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What could explain the results?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Many participants accurately guessed which treatment they received, possibly amplifying placebo effects and influencing perceived mood improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology, ketamine, and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6f5f9e5fef3f78ff6c2d5d298dfd3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ciara O’Shea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ciara O’Shea – TCD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.3019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Serial Ketamine Infusions as Adjunctive Therapy to Inpatient Care for Depressio&lt;/a&gt;n” by Declan McLoughlin et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial Ketamine Infusions as Adjunctive Therapy to Inpatient Care for Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial ketamine infusions are being increasingly adopted as off-label treatment for major depression in routine clinical practice, yet robust psychoactive placebo-controlled trial evidence for short- and long-term efficacy and safety remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess antidepressant efficacy, safety, tolerability, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life during and after serial ketamine infusions compared with midazolam as an adjunct to usual inpatient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KARMA-Dep 2 trial was an investigator-led, double-blind, randomized, midazolam-controlled, pragmatic trial conducted at an academic center in Ireland between September 2021 and August 2024.

In the analysis of primary outcome, end-of-treatment MADRS scores did not significantly differ between the ketamine and midazolam groups (adjusted mean difference, −3.16 points, 95% CI, −8.54 to 2.22; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .25; Cohen &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;, −0.29).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there was no significant between-group difference between Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, Self-Report, scores (adjusted mean difference, −0.002; 95% CI, −2.71 to 2.71; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; .99; Cohen &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;, −0.0004). There were no significant between-group differences on other secondary outcomes, including cognition, cost-effectiveness, or quality of life. Most patients and raters accurately guessed treatment allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serial adjunctive ketamine infusions were not more effective than serial midazolam infusions in reducing depressive symptoms in inpatients receiving usual psychiatric care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial Registration&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04939649?id=NCT04939649&amp;amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NCT04939649&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 18:03:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBnUFBhbWpWOFZGQ0M5aU1ITlRVX0l0RWJidlM0WXAwSzJoWWpRMVUxSXhMLUJfbk1YZ21sc1VmQklaTWVfZTRQZVJ2SHZMY0h0ODh0eXI2eFNYZ3hyVGU0cDZyaG9ZZEw4aXJ4VlRfT2U</guid></item><item><title>1300年前的粪便揭示了困扰墨西哥“死亡儿童洞穴”史前人类的病原体-现场科学</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/1-300-year-old-poop-reveals-pathogens-plagued-prehistoric-people-in-mexicos-cave-of-the-dead-children</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Antidepressants, medications used to treat depression, anxiety and other health conditions, can cause a wide range of physiological side effects depending on which one you take, according to a new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2825%2901293-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed more than 58,000 participants to compare 30 antidepressants with a placebo for an average of eight weeks, finding "clinically significant" differences between the drugs' effect on blood flow and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences noted in the study include weight change, heart rate, blood pressure and total cholesterol.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weight change, researchers found some antidepressants, including maprotiline and amitriptyline, were associated with weight gain in almost half of participants — about a 4-pound average increase with maprotiline, for example. However, other drugs, such as agomelatine, were associated with weight loss in 55% of patients who lost approximately 5.5 pounds on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For heart rate, some drugs caused increases — like a 14 beats-per-minute increase on average for nortriptyline — while others caused decreases, such as an average decrease of 8 beats-per-minute for fluvoxamine.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels and heart rhythm were not majorly effected by most antidepressants, according to the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings should not deter people from taking antidepressants, which remain effective treatments, the study's authors write, but instead should highlight the need for better tailoring of treatments to best fit a patient's health and preferences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do know that these medications are life-saving and life-changing, but they can have variation from person to person depending on a person's metabolism, their age (and) what other medications they're on," psychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma, who was not involved in the study, said on "CBS Mornings Plus" Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated depression also can cause the side effects explored in the study, including weight gain or loss, Varma added, making it important to "weigh the risks and the benefits" of medications.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She suggests doctors make it clear to patients that antidepressants can potentially exacerbate underlying conditions like elevated cholesterol or diabetes, make a plan to monitor side effects carefully and provide an array of lifestyle interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's not cause panic, but these medications do have really important side effects," Varma said.  &lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8996025/"&gt;2021 study published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; taking into account roughly 4,000 people backs this up, showing that participants who supplemented with magnesium experienced higher quality sleep than participants who didn’t supplement with magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 magnesium-rich foods worth adding to your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, it’s best to get magnesium through diet versus supplements because you’ll be consuming other important nutrients at the same time. The magnesium-rich foods included here all have other nutrients that either support sleep, mood, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Pumpkin seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds top both Pratt and Dryden’s lists for the best magnesium-rich foods for better mood and sleep. &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;It has more magnesium than any other food&lt;/a&gt;, with 156 milligrams per serving, or 37% of the recommended daily value. “Pumpkin seeds also contain tryptophan, which is an amino acid that’s important for relaxation and sleep,” Dryden says. If you don’t plan on carving any pumpkins this fall, pumpkin seeds are easy to find at most grocery stores. They make a nice, crunchy topper for salads, oatmeal, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Chia seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another seed that’s high in magnesium is chia seeds. “Two tablespoons of chia seeds is going to give you a pretty decent amount of magnesium,” Dryden says. Besides magnesium, she says that these tiny seeds are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain function and decreasing inflammation—both important for avoiding depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Leafy greens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One magnesium-rich food Kriegler recommends is leafy greens because it’s super versatile and high in many other important nutrients, including &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-fiber-diet-2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. You probably already know how important fiber is for gut health.

To the untrained eye, they basically look the same as what you’d expect a sauna to look like—wood paneling, benches, some guy who just had to bring his phone inside—and both actually share a bunch of the same health benefits. But why does every gym, wellness club, and boutique &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-get-the-benefits-of-hiit-workouts-without-burning-out"&gt;HIIT workout&lt;/a&gt; studio suddenly seem to have these new-wave sweat boxes in their &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gq-125-rules-for-modern-gentlemen-manners-etiquette-guide"&gt;locker rooms&lt;/a&gt;? For one, it’s a matter of practicality. Infrared saunas give off way less heat, thus making the surrounding area a much more habitable place for those who’d prefer not to partake. But, more importantly, the wellness industry loves a shiny new thing—especially one that conveniently doesn’t give club members the tools to burn down the building. And, as it turns out, infrared saunas actually have some unique benefits of their own. (For one, they’re less likely to overheat your iPhone, not that we’d know anything about that.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared vs. traditional sauna: What’s the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, there are several variations of saunas, but they mostly tend to get lumped into two categories: traditional and infrared. A true traditional sauna, also called a Finnish sauna, uses a wood fire to heat stones, which in turn heat the air inside the sauna. Nowadays, you can also find electric saunas (these tend to get filed under “traditional”), which also use stones, but the stones are heated by electricity rather than fire. Traditional saunas can maintain temperatures between 150-220 degrees Fahrenheit. “These typically operate at higher temperatures with dry heat, inducing intense sweating,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/"}' href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Setareh, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, director of clinical cardiology at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional saunas, Infrared saunas do not have a central heat source. Instead, they utilize ceramic or metallic panels to emit far-infrared light. “An infrared sauna uses infrared light to directly heat your body, rather than heating the air around you like a traditional sauna,” Dr. Setareh says. Hence, infrared saunas are able to operate at much lower temperatures—between 100–165 degrees—while still giving you a similar, albeit decidedly less intense, sensation to sitting in a traditional sauna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Setareh, “both types of saunas share common benefits—like improving circulation, promoting relaxation, and encouraging recovery,” and studies have also found both to have positive effects on lowering &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/apple-watchs-new-hypertension-feature-could-save-your-life"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are some important differences that may influence which type of sauna is ultimately best for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional saunas seem to be better for cardiovascular health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research, including a landmark 2015 Finnish &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2130724"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that surveyed 2,315 men over the course of two decades, has long associated sauna use with heart health and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. But it wasn’t until a recent &lt;a data-offer-url="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025"}' href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00012.2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published earlier this year in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Physiology,&lt;/em&gt; that researchers have formally begun weighing the benefits of traditional saunas against their infrared counterparts. (This latest study also compared both types of sauna to a hot tub, which surprisingly emerged as &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/are-hot-tubs-actually-better-for-you-than-saunas#:~:text=Traditional%20saunas%20are%20usually%20heated,at%20just%20over%20100%20degrees."&gt;the most beneficial of the three&lt;/a&gt; when it came to promoting heart health.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that the far-infrared sauna, by far, showed the least [noticeable] rise in core body temperature—and therefore had the least cardiovascular impact,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson"}' href="https://cas.uoregon.edu/directory/human-physiology/all/minson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christopher T.

This record setter fits the definition and then some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It unfolded within a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-soil-moisture-can-predict-severe-storms/"&gt;mesoscale convective system&lt;/a&gt;, a large organized thunderstorm complex that can cover several states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems build broad decks of electrified clouds where charge can spread sideways for huge distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Michael J. Peterson of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (&lt;a href="https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GTRI&lt;/a&gt;), Severe Storms Research Center (&lt;a href="https://severestorms.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SSRC&lt;/a&gt;), led the evaluation of the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and colleagues documented how a single continuous flash connected distant cloud regions across the Plains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee measured the horizontal extent using consistent geodesic methods and energy-weighted centroids from satellite detections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach avoids overcounting overlapping flashes and keeps the measurement standards comparable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lightning-megaflashes-are-different"&gt;Lightning megaflashes are different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most megaflashes fan out through the trailing stratiform region, the broad rain shield that sits behind a storm’s active line region. Once there, the discharge can keep stepping along for hundreds of miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These environments host a deep charge reservoir, a large zone of separated electrical charge within the cloud. Horizontal layers of charge make it easier for the channel to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record flash also produced multiple &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lightning-sparks-the-discovery-of-a-new-electromagnetic-wave/"&gt;cloud-to-ground strokes&lt;/a&gt; along its route. Each stroke tapped the same parent channel rather than starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activity can look deceptively calm when megaflashes happen. They often strike when the noisy core of the storm has moved on and the rain shield lingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-satellites-saw-the-bolt"&gt;How satellites saw the bolt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/glm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLM&lt;/a&gt;), a satellite instrument that detects brief lightning light pulses from orbit, recorded the flash. Its view covers the entire hemisphere continuously, which is crucial for catching rare giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists later reprocessed the dataset with improved clustering methods that better group individual light pulses into single flashes. That pass revealed a single continuous discharge, not several look-alike flashes packed together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This record is a case where better algorithms changed the scoreboard. It shows how detection technology shapes what we can count and compare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground networks remain essential for tracking lightning, but they often miss the largest flashes that leap across gaps between sensors and radar coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a satellite’s constant, wide-angle view fills in those blind spots, revealing the full sweep of megaflashes across the Great Plains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-giants-on-the-great-plains"&gt;Giants on the Great Plains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lines of storms often organize along cold fronts in the Plains, then spread into expansive rain shields behind the leading edge. Those shields build the ingredients that enable very long horizontal discharges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the updraft weakens, charge layers can stretch outward more than upward. That geometry favors lateral growth of a single, persistent channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is not a louder storm, but a farther-reaching one. Length, not loudness, is the headline for megaflashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding that difference matters for safety and for forecasting. It explains why lightning hazards can extend far beyond the noisy heart of a storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/10/22104542/lightning-bolt_megaflash_515-mile-long_broke-record_AMS_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/10/22104549/lightning-bolt_megaflash_515-mile-long_broke-record_AMS_1s.webp" alt="Composite satellite imagery mapping the candidate megaflash.

As satellites reveal longer and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lightning-bolt-stretching-hundreds-of-miles-breaks-world-record/"&gt;longer events&lt;/a&gt;, forecasters can update safety guidance to account for lightning that travels hundreds of miles from a storm’s core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lightning-megaflashes-and-safety"&gt;Lightning, megaflashes, and safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightning can arrive from far away when storms organize into large complexes. Distance from heavy rain alone is not a shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A single strike can potentially impact a lot of people,” said Peterson, lead author of the study.  His point is simple and practical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see lightning or receive a credible alert, get inside a substantial building quickly. A fully enclosed, metal-topped vehicle is the next best option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather records are not static, and the tools to track lightning keep improving. As archives grow, scientists expect to find other rare giants hiding in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/106/9/BAMS-D-25-0037.1.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:54:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPbEU3MHZZN0dwZ0R5NGt3SnIyc2pBQ1lDcXJObVJtVnd2VExtYWc2aENlRjFOZmRjOExXeUtfandTbnY3ZW1DNmhla2h1VnlVb1JRaTQ0dTdNMm1qWXVKeGs0Z1R5UlhIejlfeUxPenlPd0F3RG1FZlEyaC1xYnBtdW5jTXRHdW1ETElRRUFha1ZEeWR0MVh6VmJJNmJDVWs</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示不应忽视的痔疮早期征兆- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/doctors-reveal-early-signs-hemorrhoids-152900255.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;These Symptoms May Be Hemorrhoids, Per Doctors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Ekaterina Demidova - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many bathroom-related health problems, hemorrhoids are both uncomfortable to experience and uncomfortable to talk about. But also like many of these issues, they are very common, affecting 1 in 20 American men and women, and roughly half of adults older than 50, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/definition-facts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NIDDK). Yet despite how many people have them, most don't know the most common hemorrhoids symptoms and may be missing out on the treatment they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/jeffery-nelson-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jeffery Nelson, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jeffery Nelson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a colorectal surgeon and surgical director of The Center for Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Diseases at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Bedford, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, digestive health experts reveal everything you need to know about hemorrhoids, including why they form, the most common symptoms, and what you can do to get rid of them and find relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are hemorrhoids, exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen, inflamed veins around the anus or lower rectum, according to the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhoids.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (NLM). “Hemorrhoids are normal anatomy, like having hands,” said &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/jeffery-nelson-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jeffery Nelson, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jeffery Nelson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a colorectal surgeon and surgical director of The Center for Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Diseases at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore. “Everyone has hemorrhoidal tissue.” The defining factor is whether the tissue is inflamed, which is what causes the unpleasant symptoms that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types: Internal hemorrhoids form in the lining of the anus and lower rectum, while external hemorrhoids form under the skin around the anus, per the NIDDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes of hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why some people struggle with hemorrhoids and others don’t, Dr. Nelson said. “But there can be a genetic component to it,” meaning it can run in families. There are a few things that may also up your risk of developing hemorrhoids, the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIDDK&lt;/a&gt; says, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;straining to poop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;sitting on the toilet for long periods of time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;having chronic constipation or diarrhea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;eating a low-fiber diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;weakening of the supporting tissues in your anus and rectum that happens with aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;pregnancy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;regularly lifting heavy objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common symptoms of hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms you experience will depend on the type of hemorrhoids you have, Dr. Nelson said. If you have &lt;strong&gt;external hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ll probably have the following symptoms, per the NLM:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;anal itching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;one or more hard, tender lumps near your anus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;anal aches or pain that you feel or gets worse when you sit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have &lt;strong&gt;internal hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;, you’ll likely have these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;bleeding from your rectum (which shows up as bright red blood in your poop, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after you poop)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a hemorrhoid that has fallen through your anus, which is called prolapse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hemorrhoids, for the most part, do not cause pain when you have a bowel movement,” said &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/198965-rudolph-albert-bedford" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rudolph Bedford, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. However, if you have a prolapsed hemorrhoid, you can also experience swelling and pain if it doesn’t go back inside your body, Dr. Nelson said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best ways to get rid of hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few remedies you can try to treat hemorrhoids at home, Dr. Bedford said. First, eating a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g65893093/high-fiber-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-fiber diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-fiber diet&lt;/a&gt;, exercising regularly, and drinking plenty of liquids can help make your poop softer and move it along more easily, so it doesn’t cause extra irritation to your hemorrhoids. Avoiding sitting for long periods of time can also minimize discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a sitz bath for 20 minutes a night for a week or two will also help keep the anal area clean, reduce inflammation, and generally make you feel more comfortable, per the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIDDK&lt;/a&gt;. Simply sit in a bathtub filled with 3 to 4 inches of warm water or buy a plastic tub that holds the water and fits over your toilet seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re still having trouble, there are over-the-counter hemorrhoid creams and ointments that can help, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Preparation-Hemorrhoid-Treatment-Ointment-Discomfort/dp/B07PQY3F3S/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.69120568%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Preparation H;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Preparation H&lt;/a&gt;. “These can help decrease inflammation and help shrivel up or shrink hemorrhoids,” Dr. Bedford said. If that doesn’t do the trick, your doctor may recommend a prescription cream or suppository to try to fix the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor about your hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ever concerned about your hemorrhoids or you’re not sure what’s happening down there, you should call your doctor, Dr. Nelson said, especially if you’ve had symptoms for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your doctor will likely recommend that you use medication or at-home remedies first but, if that doesn’t help, the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/hemorrhoids/treatment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIDDK;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIDDK&lt;/a&gt; says there are other treatment options available. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rubber band ligation&lt;/strong&gt;, where a doctor essentially cuts off the blood supply to a bleeding or prolapsed internal hemorrhoid with a rubber band so that the hemorrhoid shrivels and falls off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sclerotherapy&lt;/strong&gt;, in which a doctor injects a solution into an internal hemorrhoid, causing scar tissue to form that cuts off the blood supply and shrinks the hemorrhoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared photocoagulation&lt;/strong&gt;, which uses infrared light to form scar tissue on an internal hemorrhoid, cutting off the blood supply and shrinking the hemorrhoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrocoagulation&lt;/strong&gt;, which sends an electric current into an internal hemorrhoid to form scar tissue, cut off the blood supply and shrink the hemorrhoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgical removal&lt;/strong&gt;, which may be used in more severe cases on large external hemorrhoids and prolapsing internal hemorrhoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:48:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNVUMtaG1LQS1OS3Jwd2hzaENpdzZxbjhZRXItTnQ5Y3VqYTk2aXN5ZnVMd1RsemVXWEpkRENMTlBJVGNwWUp2QmhqZldtWWdpWFllR1pJQWlxb004cWpBNWdDVm1fUkJBRTdyY2hJekF4cEItenBON3h3anV1dTg4cXY2amNVUlBYSEE</guid></item><item><title>我以为我只是抑郁...但医生诊断我患有世界上最致命的疾病-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15216819/depressed-tuberculosis-deadliest-lung-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman suffering from crippling &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-628cf340-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety was found to have the world's deadliest disease ravaging her entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 43-year-old from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-62949460-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; was admitted to the psychiatric ward at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital with severe depression and plans to commit suicide by overdosing on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had several severe stressors in her life, including bipolar disorder, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/domestic-violence/index.html" id="mol-628d4160-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt;, financial troubles and limited access to stable housing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she also had spent the past two months suffering from a dry, hacking cough. Throughout her hospital stay, her breathing and oxygen levels increasingly worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X-ray scans showed several small nodules spread across the woman's lungs, a sign of bacteria. In additional scans, doctors found the lesions in the liver, lymph nodes, pancreas and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After nine weeks, biopsies and bacterial samples came back positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, &lt;span&gt;a respiratory condition &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15082229/maps-reveal-deadliest-disease-tuberculosis-concerning-rise.html"&gt;dubbed the deadliest disease on the planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; due to resistance to certain antibiotics and increased spread in developing countries that lack modern antibiotics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though rare in the US today, affecting just a few thousand Americans every year, tuberculosis most often strikes people with weakened immune systems, those living in prisons or homeless shelters and people born in countries with higher rates of the disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous woman had been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-628e2bc0-af59-11f0-beb6-1b3d6930e422"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;) 17 years earlier and had limited access to her medications for two years leading up to her emergency room visit, which could have made her vulnerable to TB, doctors treating her &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412536?logout=true#sec-4"&gt;wrote in a medical journal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An unidentified woman visited Massachusetts General Hospital with depression, suicidal thoughts and persistent dry cough. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis that had spread to multiple organs, including her brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above x-ray scan shows nodules in the woman's lungs from tuberculosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also regularly smoked crack cocaine, as well as a pack of cigarettes every day and drank alcohol frequently, all of which may have damaged her lungs and kept her immune system from fighting off the bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman was found to have disseminated tuberculosis, a severe form of the disease that strikes multiple organs, including her brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria may have triggered inflammation and reduced production of the amino acid tryptophan, which is crucial for producing mood-boosting serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she had significant stressors in her life, doctors suggested the TB may have exacerbated her mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, TB infects a few thousand Americans every year and kills about 500, far fewer than cancer, heart disease and dementia. The threat is much more prevalent in developing countries, however, and TB kills 1.2million people worldwide each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB in the US was on a steady decline from 1993 until 2020, when the overall number of cases hit an all-time low of 7,170. But in 2021, that number jumped to 7,866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence has gone up every year since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows the US provisionally recorded 10,347 TB cases in 2024 - up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011, when there were 10,471 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above scans show nodules in several of the woman's organs. Image A is a scan of her lungs, with arrows pointing toward the nodules. Image B shows an arrow pointing toward an enlarged lymph node. Image C shows arrows drawing attention to nodules in the liver and head of the pancreas, and Image D shows a nodule in the woman's brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are now on the rise in 80 percent of US states, which experts have blamed missed cases and distrust of doctors forged by the Covid pandemic.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demographics of TB have also shifted, starting in 2001. That was the first year the CDC reported more non-US born citizen patients than US-born, meaning immigrants and travelers were the driving force behind infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB spreads through airborne droplets that are released into the air when a person with active TB coughs, sneezes or speaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms include a persistent and unexplained cough, sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain. Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties and extensive lung damage, and the infection may spread to other organs or the back, causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are most often due to respiratory failure caused by bacterial damage to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in cases like the woman's, TB in the brain can damage vital tissues and increase pressure in the skull, causing nerve cells to die off. Eventually, this can lead paralysis and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis can be prevented with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Though, due to the generally low risk, it is not routinely offered in the US, except for to children regularly exposed to people with active TB or healthcare workers in areas with increased spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman in the case report spent 33 days in the hospital receiving antibiotics and steroids for the TB and antiretrovirals, which reduce the viral load from HIV. She was discharged to a medical facility for homeless people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later, she was hospitalized again for depression and suicidal ideation due to housing concerns and has since completed antituberculosis treatments again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is recovering from drug addiction as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Certain cancers are becoming a bigger problem for just about everyone. New research shows cases of several obesity-related cancers have been rising across the globe and across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK examined cancer surveillance data spanning 15 years from dozens of countries, including the U.S. They found that, in most countries, several cancer types had increased in both younger and older adults, all of which are linked to obesity. The findings suggest that the surge in cancer cases seen recently isn’t just limited to the young, as some past research and media reports have highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A widespread rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have spotted a rise in specific cancers among the young. Earlier this summer, for instance, Dana-Farber researchers &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gastrointestinal-cancers-are-surging-among-younger-americans-2000631264"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a steady increase of gastrointestinal cancers in Americans under the age of 50, dating back over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this current study wanted to take a more expansive look at recent cancer trends, however, both internationally and across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They analyzed data on annually reported cancer cases between 2003 and 2017 from 42 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America, and Australia. They focused specifically on 13 types of cancer that past studies have shown may be increasing in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In most of the countries, the researchers found a clear rise in 6 cancer types among adults under the age of 50 during those years: thyroid cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, endometrial cancer, and leukemia. But they also found a similar increase in new cases among older adults for five of these cancers. The sole exception was colorectal cancer; an increase of these cases in older adults was only seen in half the countries, and the rate of this increase was generally larger in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, rates of liver, oral, esophageal, and stomach cancer also actually decreased for younger people in more than half the countries studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What this means for cancer prevention&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02718"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, don’t mean that the reported cancer rise in young adults has been a mirage. But it does complicate things.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If cancer cases are generally rising across age groups, for instance, that suggests risk factors common to most everyone are to blame, rather than something only affecting young adults. That’s important to know, since scientists and health organizations might otherwise focus only on studying or trying to reverse this rise in young people. Notably, all of the cancer types that might be increasing in both younger and older adults are linked to obesity—a condition that has become more prevalent throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings can help inform future research and clinical and public health guidelines,” the authors wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the still apparent difference in colorectal cancer trends points to unique health risks that younger people might be facing. Some research has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-may-have-figured-out-why-young-people-are-getting-colorectal-cancer-more-often-2000594349"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that younger people could be getting exposed more to certain gastrointestinal infections, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

In comparison, rates of all other breast cancers have risen by just under 1% a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invasive lobular carcinoma — or ILC — is now behind more than one in 10 cases of breast cancer nationwide. That's about 47,000 people a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ILC begins in milk-producing glands and then spreads to nearby tissue. It's hard to detect because the cancer cells don't form a defined mass that shows up in mammograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it spreads in thin strands that appear as normal breast tissue on medical images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/promising-breast-cancer-vaccine-could-be-available-by-2030-researchers-say"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promising breast cancer vaccine could be available by 2030, researchers say&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say that because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure could be a contributor. The ages at which women have children and start menopause have shifted over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use could also be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say a breast ultrasound or breast MRI can provide a more detailed view of this elusive cancer and are especially important to consider if you have a higher risk or family history of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh25ocoy004z3b7990ga40y7@published"&gt;I can’t stop feeling insecure about how much I must smell and how gross I am after an intense workout. But according to her, she loves it and it drives her wild. I really want to believe her, but it’s hard to trust that someone could enjoy the smells of body odor and sweat. Is there a way I can let loose and enjoy this more? Or should I just put a stop to the post-gym second workout?&lt;/p&gt;

Not all BO and sweat are made alike, and if the sweat isn’t fresh (and, for example, dries on clothes that aren’t removed or, worse, reworn), it can smell sour. But good BO can be &lt;em&gt;so good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, there’s a gay party in New York called &lt;a href="https://pheromonenyc.com/"&gt;Pheromone&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/09/style/this-party-stinks-thats-the-point.html"&gt;caters to&lt;/a&gt; guys who want to stick their noses in each other’s pits. Read up a little more on this kink, and it may be easier to understand that, yeah, some people like this a lot. It requires very little of you to allow your girlfriend to indulge (merely raising an arm, if that), and if you can be comfortable with that, you should. She’s expressed how into it she is—believe her.&lt;/p&gt;

In the United States, we’re generally taught to scrub away our natural odors, and that can ingrain in us a sense that we smell bad. There may be no getting around this for you. With the knowledge that what your girlfriend is asking for is highly common, see if you can just relax and let her do her thing with your post-workout body. If you find yourself unable to get into it or with lingering discomfort, maybe you don’t rock full post-workout funk. Maybe you let her enjoy you in the morning, before you’ve showered or put on deodorant. Or at the end of the day, when your deodorant has run out. Test your own boundaries of comfort. If you ultimately conclude that any amount of funk is too much for you to unleash, that’s totally OK.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, he’s still tall, witty, and cute. But time is beginning to catch up with him. His hair is thinning, and he’s not as slim and fit as he used to be. Basically, he’s aging. And I’m afraid I don’t find him as attractive as I did before. For that reason, I’ve been making excuses, and our sex life has been lacking lately. I’m just not as attracted to him as I used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m also aging, and what’s worse, men often trade their wives for younger models. I don’t want to trade my husband for a younger man, but is there anything I can do to feel more attracted to him as he (and I) keep getting older? I love this guy. I don’t want to leave him just because he has a little less hair and can’t fit into ultra-tight leather trousers anymore, but I never thought I’d have to wonder how to stay physically attracted to your aging spouse. How do people do this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23nrzz002x3b79qlp0sdyo@published"&gt;Usually, when this issue comes up, at least in this column, it presents with less specificity. People feel less compelled to have sex with a long-term partner for reasons that they often can’t quite spell out. The spark is gone, sex is less exciting. It’s hard to even muster the effort to qualify “blah,” because, well, that’s blah for you. In those cases, usually my advice is to apply Esther Perel’s methods of creating eroticizing distance in your relationship, as detailed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ORNN2XAXU0CZ&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bXIETwz6rg35EJfbpa4eyUiUlcEoJVKlMs9LiYHOqblAJzKIemTav2l00ugUSJJW7ORQlh-We27SCj6Lwk9lviXae-tZ4B6u-YU5GEfHTPQqVV-LlBAHezu-SlAbgecF9IKKzRf950upYZbF7_o91Y0PEDCoN6BjPoO3w7cJkmNOCMb9wb_ZPbDVJPpAO6DWBxVv-1KOUCgfE8nv5fpogL7Gxntk4J0m657sQ6boPB0.fubgQNBPTZ1szWcsr9vCQZ16tiGwdRVyPqj7xpkTABY&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=mating+in+captivity+esther+perel&amp;amp;qid=1760910376&amp;amp;sprefix=mating+in+captiv,aps,120&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to shake yourselves out of routine by, for example, changing venues (via a weekly hotel sex date, for example) or erotic letters. Seeing an old partner with new eyes can make sex more exciting. You may want to try something like this (or at least read Perel&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for more ideas and to think about whether they could even apply to your situation).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23nrzz002y3b79nmj6y4pz@published"&gt;But if this is an issue with type (i.e., you’re into people who are younger than your husband), what can you do? You like what you like. You may want to play with the idea of sensation/exploration to help bring you in—if there is stuff you haven’t tried but want to, like toys, kink, or groups, that might be a way to recharge things. You could also kind of do an anti-Perel and focus on sex as not a carnal way to get your rocks off, but as an expression of love and appreciation for this person who has been by your side for 20 years. That might not be so exciting, but it could at least give you an attainable goal. If nothing here works, consider counseling—either solo or couples. The latter could, of course, require you to be honest about your lessened attraction to your husband, which might be hard. But a third party’s help regaining it or at least relearning how to find sex exciting with your partner might make the momentary awkwardness worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

We were married young, but all was well. In his early 30s, our sex life changed, and we started having more time between having sex. He was very into his hobbies, and at times, I felt left out since I was home with our daughters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0100313b7979jfr2g0@published"&gt;Fast forward through his 30s to 50s, and there would be months between intimacy. I’m almost 10 years younger and still wanted to be with him. I love him very deeply, and I know he loves me. But he just doesn’t seem interested in me. This has harmed my self-esteem greatly. Time moved forward, and he began to have erectile dysfunction issues. I begged him to go to the doctor. He finally did and received medication. He tried them once, and that was it. They either didn’t work or it’s me that’s the problem. I cannot remember the last time we had sex, but it has been years.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0200323b79g84uhjho@published"&gt;As expected, we’ve grown apart in multiple ways. Politically, he has become far more conservative, and I’ve become more liberal. This applies since it is one more division and one less thing we can discuss together. About 15 years ago, we went to therapy. He was fine with the two of us together. I don’t know what happened in his one time in individual therapy, but our therapist stated to me in my next session that I should divorce him, which seemed a surprising statement to me. I didn’t act on that because frankly, that’s not how we were raised. He will not go back to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0300363b79mtgqyo0y@published"&gt;It’s never too late for a divorce. If your concern is about restarting your life and finding another partner, realize that people can and do find love at any age. Besides, if that is what’s preoccupying you, you’re looking way into the future when you should be concentrated on your immediate situation. Forget how you were raised (easier said than done, I know)—why stay in something if it’s not serving you? Do you want to spend the rest of your life in a situation that you find sexually frustrating with someone whom you seem to be drifting further and further away from? If you do, you don’t have much of a shot at finding new love, at least not ethically. If you leave, you open your world to chance.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="221" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0300373b79y4kombw5@published"&gt;I’m not saying that your letter reads like the only way for you to be happy is to divorce. I’m an optimist, and I know that even seemingly desperate situations can be turned around. I believe in the power of love. But some things concern me here. There seems to be a communication breakdown between you and your husband. He got ED meds, they didn’t work, and why seems to be a mystery. From that, I infer that he talked little about what was actually going on with him. The thing about PDE5 inhibitors is that they don’t tend to be effective &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pde5-inhibitors#sildenafil-viagra"&gt;without a will to have sex&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., horniness). They facilitate blood flow, but something needs to get the blood flowing. This does not mean that the problem is you (though it certainly could be that your husband isn’t attracted to you—I don’t want to sugarcoat this and dismiss that possibility entirely). It could also have something to do with him physically (a hormonal issue, for example) or sexually (perhaps he has a fetish that is not being catered to, or it could have something to do with his sexuality, like maybe he’s asexual). We don’t know because he’s not saying, and maybe part of why he’s not saying is that he’s not investigating. Shame could also be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh23ns0400383b79f0h6i3xb@published"&gt;If I’m reading your letter right, it seems like your couples counselor saw you individually, which is not usually how these things go, and that they then told you to divorce your husband without explanation. That entire interaction sounds strange to me. When you write that he will not go back to therapy, I am assuming that the situation turned him off therapy altogether, including couples therapy. If that is not the case, find a different couples therapist and go. If it is, what can you do? You can’t make him get the help that your relationship greatly needs. Having a discussion in which you state that you are considering separation/divorce might help him see the gravity of the situation. It seems that might be one of the few tools that you have left. Consider using it.&lt;/p&gt;

The chart review for this study involved three groups of patients: (1) patients with tumour biopsies confirming stage III or stage IV NSCLC between January 2017 and September 2022; (2) patients with melanoma of any stage who received single- or multi-agent immune checkpoint blockade between January 2019 and December 2022; and (3) a tissue-agnostic cohort, which included all patients with pathology results for PD-L1 from January 2020 to October 2023 at our institution across a wide range of histologies. This study was approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board. Informed consent was waived due to the retrospective and de-identified nature of the data. The data-collection cut-off was 1 September 2024; data analysis was performed from 1 September 2024 to 29 July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the NSCLC dataset, patient information was collected regarding patient demographics (such as age at immunotherapy start, sex, ethnicity), primary tumour histology, clinical stage, known tumour mutations (such as those in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, ALK, MET, p53 and RET), metastatic burden at immunotherapy start (brain, liver), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS; range, 0–5) near the initiation of immunotherapy, radiation therapy in the time around immunotherapy start, chemotherapy history, immunodeficiency, comorbidities (heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease), history of other primary tumours, steroid use around immunotherapy initiation, date of last follow-up, date of death, date of first recurrence or progression, ICI agent names and start dates, COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination dates, and TPS. Recorded PD-L1 expression as reported below was required for inclusion in the survival analysis for NSCLC. For patients with multiple biopsies, the PD-L1 expression recorded from the closest biopsy to ICI start was used for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the melanoma dataset, patient information was collected regarding patient demographics (including age at immunotherapy start, sex, ethnicity), primary tumour histology, clinical stage, known tumour mutations (such as those in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, ALK, MET, p53 and RET), metastatic burden at immunotherapy start (for example, brain, liver), PS (range, 0–5) at the initiation of immunotherapy, chemotherapy history, immunodeficiency, comorbidities (for example, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease), other primary tumour data, steroid use around COVID-19 vaccination and immunotherapy initiation, date of last follow-up, date of death, date of first recurrence/progression, ICI agent names and start dates, and COVID-19 vaccination dates. Although our dataset did not include specific vaccine formulations administered to each patient, vaccine formulations administered during the study period included the original monovalent mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna (100 µg mRNA prime, 50 µg mRNA booster) released on 18 December 2020; the bivalent Moderna vaccine targeting the original strain and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 (50 µg mRNA) released on 1 September 2022; the original monovalent vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech (30 µg mRNA prime and booster) released on 11 December 2020; and the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent formulation (30 µg mRNA) released on 31 August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were separated into two groups: (1) patients who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccination within 100 days of ICI start; and (2) patients who did not receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Survival analysis was performed using these groups, with subanalysis involving staging of the tumour, brand of mRNA vaccine, number of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, location of metastases and cycle of immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in both the NSCLC and melanoma datasets, OS was calculated as the time between the date of immunotherapy start closest to the mRNA vaccination date, and the last follow-up date or date of death. For patients who did not receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, OS was calculated as the time between the initiation of their first ICI start and the date of death or last follow-up. For patients who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, PFS was calculated as the time between the initiation of ICI closest to mRNA vaccination and the first incidence of either pathology-confirmed recurrence or imaging-confirmed progression, whichever occurred earlier, that was declared progression in their primary medical oncologist’s clinical notes. For patients who did not receive COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, PFS was calculated as the time between their first ICI start date and clinician-confirmed progression as described above. Patients who progressed before the receipt of mRNA vaccination were included in the vaccination group for this analysis. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated using GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Cox proportional hazards regression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cox proportional hazards regression, time-dependent variables were defined as described in the figure captions. Continuous/numbered variables (such as age, BMI, PD-L1 expression, ECOG and treatment year) were retained as numeric. Binary and categorical variables (for example, stage, gender, mutational status, comorbidities) were converted into factors. For each variable, we constructed individual Cox proportional hazards models. HRs, 95% CIs (Wald) and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were extracted from model summaries. Variables with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 in univariable analysis were considered for multivariable modelling. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions were similarly generated with significant variables from univariable analysis. For multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions, patients with missing values were excluded from analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categories with fewer than five cases are reported for completeness but were considered not statistically meaningful due to convergence and insufficient data for reliable inference. Variables with significant relationships with survival were included in multivariable analyses (MVAs), and those significant after MVA (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were included in PSM. Certain variables (for example, steroid use within 1 month of vaccine) represented subgroups of the treatment cohort by definition. These were evaluated descriptively and in univariable models but were not included as covariables in MVAs, as they do not represent baseline confounders and were not significant on univariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed the proportional hazards assumption in multivariate models by evaluating Schoenfeld residuals and found no major violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Imputation and PSM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of patients in the NSCLC dataset did not have documented ECOG scores, which were an important predictor of outcomes in Cox proportional hazards regression. BMI had missingness in initial univariable analyses but, because it was not required for PSM, imputation was not performed to address the missingness. Multivariable logistic regression and ridge regression were used to evaluate associations between ECOG missingness and clinically relevant pretreatment covariables. Ridge regression was selected due to multicollinearity between important variables that could not be excluded from the model. Variables not included in models predicting ECOG missingness were vaccination status, steroid usage within a timeframe of vaccination or ICI, PD-L1, concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy agent and BMI (as mentioned above). Subsequent ridge regression analysis suggested that ECOG scores in this analysis had a high probability of exhibiting missingness at random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the small sample size in the stage III NSCLC dataset treatment group, multiple imputation was performed to estimate missing ECOG values using chained equations and the R package MICE, where predictive mean matching (PMM) (with set.seed(2025)) was used to create five imputed datasets. Variables used for imputation were chosen based on large absolute ridge regression coefficients (|&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;| &amp;gt; 0.3) and clinical relevance to ensure that prediction of ECOG missingness occurred with accuracy. After selection using regression coefficients, age and previous cycles of systemic therapy were included due to clinical importance. To facilitate PSM while maintaining power in patients with stage III NSCLC, the mode of the five imputed ECOG values was used as a single value for each patient (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5). This approach was necessary to minimize variance inflation and avoid diluting treatment effects in a very small sample. As PMM is random, small deviations in variable definition, factor levels and row ordering may result in slightly different imputed values. However, sensitivity analyses with slightly different mode selection in the case of ties, different seeds and an increased number of datasets (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20 or &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10 rather than &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 5) revealed similar outcomes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) after subsequent matching. The plausibility of imputed values was assessed using density plots, which demonstrated appropriate range and overlap between observed and imputed ECOG values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After imputation, PSM was performed using the R MatchIt package. A logistic regression model was used to estimate propensity scores, predicting treatment assignment of ‘vaccine within 100 days’ or ‘no vaccine’ with covariables based on significant factors associated with survival from MVA, including original or imputed ECOG scores. Across all propensity score analyses, nearest-neighbour matching was performed on the previously estimated propensity scores to identify a balanced cohort. In the case of stage III unresectable NSCLC PSM, nearest-neighbour PSM was performed with a caliper of 0.1 and a 2:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients in stage III UR NSCLC to improve covariable balance and maximize statistical power. Sensitivity analysis with removal of ECOG from the PSM model revealed similar trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stage IV NSCLC, patients with missing ECOG were excluded due to sufficient remaining sample size. PSM was once again performed with nearest-neighbour matching, with a caliper of 0.1 and a 1:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients. Sensitivity analyses with removal of ECOG from PSM rather than imputation and with the same methods as reported in stage III NSCLC (with the same caliper of 0.1 but with a ratio of 1:1 rather than 2:1) also each revealed statistically significant results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No imputation was performed in the melanoma cohort due to completeness of variables. The melanoma PSM analyses were run with nearest-neighbour matching with a caliper of 0.1 and a 1:1 ratio of control patients to treated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all matched cohorts, absolute standardized mean differences (|SMD|) of pscores were consistently less than 0.05 after matching, indicating excellent balance between groups. Balance diagnostics were confirmed visually using jitter plots and histograms of propensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Survival analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate survival distributions for the matched groups. Log-rank tests were conducted to assess the differences between treatment groups. GraphPad Prism was used to visualize Kaplan–Meier curves, 95% CIs and at-risk numbers at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 months, including after extraction of propensity score-matched data from R. Comparisons between groups in primary datasets (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) were reported as adjusted HRs calculated with Cox proportional hazard regression. Comparisons between groups in subgroup analyses were reported as unadjusted HRs calculated with log-rank tests to preserve robustness. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are reported for primary survival analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In settings in which Kaplan–Meier curves crossed, the restricted mean survival time was calculated using area under the curve analysis of the absolute differences between arms at 12 and 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All statistical analyses were conducted in R v.4.4.2 (2024-10-31) and GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Quantification of PD-L1 expression in biopsy samples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients in both the tissue-agnostic cohort and the NSCLC dataset, biopsy date, pathology reports, histological information and diagnosis codes were collected for patients who had received a biopsy with pathology evaluating PD-L1 at MD Anderson (from January 2020 to October 2023 for the tissue-agnostic cohort and August 2016 to August 2022 for the NSCLC cohort). PD-L1 on tumour cells (TPS) and PD-L1 on tumour cells and immune cells together (CPS) were obtained from pathology reports. Data were curated according to the following principles: (1) simple quantitative values were replicated exactly; (2) TPS values of “&amp;lt;1%” were reported as 0%; (3) for patients with a CPS of 0% or CPS &amp;lt;1% with no TPS value, TPS was reported as 0%, as CPS of 0 or &amp;lt;1% implies a lack of expression of PD-L1 on both tumour cells and myeloid cells; (4) TPS values between 1.1 and 49.9 reported as “&amp;lt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;%” or “&amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;%” were excluded due to lack of interpretability; (5) TPS values of &amp;gt;50% were recorded as 50% and TPS values &amp;gt;60% were recorded as 60%, and so on, as these values indicate high PD-L1 expression. For ranges of PD-L1 expression (for example, 0–5%), the median of the numbers in the range was taken as an approximate estimation of PD-L1 on tumours. Replicate patient biopsies (repeat biopsies performed on the same patient within 2 months of a previous biopsy) were excluded, and the earliest biopsy was included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, survival was analysed in the tumour-agnostic dataset with any COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of ICI compared with patients who had no recorded history of a COVID-19 vaccine. Survival analysis was performed as listed in the NSCLC dataset for all patients in this dataset who were treated with ICI in this cohort. TPS values were not required for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For group-wise analysis, patients in these cohorts were grouped into (1) those who received their closest COVID-19 mRNA vaccination less than 100 days before tissue biopsy; (2) patients who received their closest COVID-19 mRNA vaccine more than or exactly 100 days before tissue biopsy; and (3) patients who did not receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccination before biopsy. Patients who received non-mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines within 100 days before biopsy were included in the no-vaccine group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Healthy human participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in healthy volunteers were approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from each healthy participant before plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected and stored at baseline, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h, or baseline, 6 h, 24 h, 7 days and 14 days after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, depending on the formulation used. BNT162b2 (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2024–2025 formula, with 30 μg mRNA) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax Monovalent XBB.1.5, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, 2023–2024 formulation, with 50 μg mRNA) were used for the first and second timeframes, respectively. Frozen plasma was thawed and analysed using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel 250 by Alamar Biosciences. Absolute quantification of IFNα concentrations was performed using the NULISAseq Inflammation Panel AQ. Statistical analysis was performed using R, in which we evaluated significance using a linear model with fixed effects based on the time from vaccine and controlling for patient ID (paired), including accommodation of biological variance between the baselines using the limma package’s duplicateCorrelation function. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated using moderated &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests with FDR correction for multiple testing. For comparisons between Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, we used a linear modelling approach (limma) to assess the log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold change in cytokine concentrations per-patient from the baseline to 6 h and 24 h. Moderated &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests with empirical Bayes shrinkage were applied, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method. Contrasts were constructed to directly compare Moderna versus Pfizer for each timepoint. Cytokines were visualized if they demonstrated significant differences between Moderna and Pfizer from the baseline to 6 h or 24 h (absolute value of log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold change greater than 0.5 and FDR-corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean expression values per condition were normalized to the baseline and visualized. Volcano plots were generated using R. Heat maps and graphs of cytokines with significant changes in relative expression in the plasma at 24 h were generated in GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Human flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and immediately transferred into a 50 ml tube containing 9 ml of complete RPMI medium (RPMI + 10% FBS) at a ratio of 1 part cells to 9 parts medium. Cells were centrifuged at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min, and the supernatant was decanted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and incubated with live/dead marker (1 µl per 1,000 µl of cell suspension, containing 1–10 million cells per ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, 3 ml of PBS + 2% FBS was added, and the cells were centrifuged again at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 8 min and the supernatant was decanted. Cells were then pre-incubated with 5 µl of Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, 422302) per 100 µl of cell suspension for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and centrifuged at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 6 min. After decanting the supernatant, 10 µl of Brilliant buffer was added to each tube, and the mixture was allowed to sit for 5 min before addition of antibodies targeting extracellular markers and the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed and fixed in the dark for 45 min at 4 °C with 500 µl of fixation solution (BD). Cells were then permeabilized with 2 ml permeabilization buffer. Intracellular stains were added in permeabilization buffer, and cells were incubated for approximately 40 min at room temperature. After incubation, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in 200 µl of PBS + 2% FBS. Analysis was then conducted using Cytek Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Preclinical experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mouse experiments and procedures were approved by the University of Florida or the University of Texas MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice (aged 4–10 weeks) were maintained at 21 ± 1 °C and 35% humidity under a 14 h–10 h light–dark cycle. Mice were randomized prior to treatment. Tumour measurements were performed blinded to the treatment group. Euthanasia was performed by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in accordance with approved protocols. Humane end points included tumour ulceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C57BL/6 and &lt;i&gt;Rigi&lt;/i&gt;-knockout mice (&lt;i&gt;C57BL/6NJ-Rigiem1(IMPC)J/Mmjax&lt;/i&gt;) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (046070-JAX) and bred in house. Tumour-bearing mice were implanted s.c. with 50,000 B16F0 melanoma cells, 1 million B16F10-OVA melanoma cells or 200,000 LLC cells in the right flank. Orthotopic LLC models were implemented by implanting 100,000 LLC cells into the left lung of C57BL6 mice through direct injection below the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; rib. A mix of male and female mice was used for experiments with B16F0, and male mice were used for experiments with LLC. All mice were vaccinated intramuscularly with 25 μg per dose of RNA-LNP or RNA-LPA (mRNA fraction)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

The 5′ SpeI restriction site was removed from the sequence to allow for restriction of the poly(A) tail. The T7 promoter was changed to have an AGG initiator sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (NEB, E0554) according to the company’s recommended protocol. Plasmids were grown in NEB5a competent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and purified using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, 75162) and sequenced using whole-plasmid sequencing by Genewiz. Plasmids were restricted by using 2 U μg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; SpeI HF (NEB, R3133L) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by DNA precipitation. mRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 mRNA Kit with CleanCap Reagent AG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A57620). Spike mRNA was made using CleanCap reagent AG (3′ OMe) (Trilink, N-7413-5) and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-methylpseudouridine-5′-triphosphate (Trilink, N-1081-10). PP65 mRNA was capped using ARCA (NEB, S1411L) followed by treatment with mRNA cap 2′-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase (NEB, M0366L). The in vitro transcription reaction was performed at 20 °C for 10 h. DNA was removed according to the kit instructions and RNA was purified using the RNeasy maxi kit (Qiagen, 75162). RNA was eluted in purified RNase-free water and stored at −80°C until use. mRNA was checked for quality using an Agilent TapeStation 4150. After thawing, RNA was diluted to 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in RNase-free water followed by incubation at room temperature or 72 °C for 3 min. Then 100 ng of RNA or 1 µl of ladder was added to 5 µl of RNA ScreenTape sample buffer (Agilent, 5067-5577) and mixed at 2,000 rpm for 1 min. The samples were run using an RNA ScreenTape (Agilent, 5067-5576).

In brief, mRNA was precipitated and reconstituted in chromatography buffer. Cellulose fibres (Sigma-Aldrich, C6288-100G) suspended in chromatography buffer were added to Nucleospin filter units (Macherey-Nagel, 740606) followed by washing. Up to 500 μg of RNA per filter unit was added to cellulose and incubated by rapid mixing for 30 min. RNA was recovered by centrifugation, and incubation was repeated using a second column containing cellulose fibres. RNA was then filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (Pall, 4604) to remove any cellulose particulate before being precipitated and reconstituted in RNase-free water&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 20" title="Baiersdorfer, M. et al.

ALC-0159 (Avanti, 880155 P), ALC-0315 (Avanti, 890900 O), cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, C8667) and DSPC (Avanti, 850365P) were reconstituted in 100% ethanol at a ratio of 1.7:47.5:40.8:10. Lipids and RNA were mixed at a 3:1 FRR on a Nanonsemblr Ignite (Precision NanoSystems, now part of Cytiva) for an N/P ratio of 6. RNA-LNPs were dialysed overnight at 4 °C with two buffer exchanges at the 3 h and 6 h timepoints using a 3.5 kDA dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A52967). After dialysis, LNPs were filtered through the 0.2 µM Supor EX ECV filter (Pall, KS2ECV2S). LNPs were concentrated using 30 kDA Amicon filters (Millipore, UFC903024) by centrifugation at 2,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. The final LNP formulation had sucrose dissolved in PBS added for a final concentration of 12%. Anionic RNA-LPAs were made as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

In brief, DOTAP liposomes 2.5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; were mixed with mRNA at a 1:1 mass to mass ratio and complexed for 15 min at room temperature before administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA concentration was determined in LNPs using the RiboGreen assay (Invitrogen, R11490) using the BioTek Cytation 3 plate reader. The encapsulation efficiency was determined by comparing readings to LNPs in TE buffer versus LNPs in 1% Triton X-100. LNPs were diluted up to 500 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with PBS before injection. Empty LNPs were used at a volume consistent with the dose of RNA-LNPs fabricated using the same steps and same amounts of lipids. Fluorescence values were plotted in a standard curve with an extrapolation factor set to 1.1. The values from wells with Triton X-100 (total mRNA) and TE buffer (free mRNA) was entered into the following equation: EE% = [1 – (Free RNA/Total RNA)] × 100%. Total mRNA RNA-LNPs were also loaded onto a 1% agarose gel made in 1× TAE buffer (Quality Biological, 351-008-131) with GelRed (Biotium, 41003-T). Then 500 ng of RNA was loaded into LNPs and free RNA was mixed with 6× SDS-free (NEB, B7025S) loading dye and run at 90 V for 45 min. Particle size was acquired using a Malvern Zetasizer Ultra and NanoSight’s NS300. Before particle-size, PDI, concentration and surface ζ potential analysis, LNPs were diluted 100-fold with HyClone HyPure water (Cytiva, SH30538.02). They were and run in triplicate at 25 °C on the Zetasizer. Orthogonal particle-size distribution and concentration measurements were carried out using Malvern’s NanoSight NS300 NTA equipment. Each LNP sample was diluted 500-fold with PBS and pumped through the equipment at constant speed for five captures with optimized camera settings. An optimized detection threshold was set for analysis. mRNA was extracted from LNPs by dissolving 750 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with 5 volumes of ethanol or 2 volumes of isopropanol followed by 2 washes with cold 70% ethanol. RNA pellets were dissolved in RNase-free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O before analysis using the TapeStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Plasma collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were bled through the retroorbital route using heparinized capillaries (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22-362566) collecting a maximum of 200 µl into EDTA coated tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NC9414041). Whole blood was centrifuged at 1,200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min. Plasma was collected and stored at −80 °C until use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Processing tumours for flow cytometry analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumours were dissected from euthanized mice with the external fibrous sac left intact. Tumours were bisected using a scalpel and half of each sample was placed into a GentleMacs column GentleMACS C Tube (130-096-334) with an enzyme mix containing 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138-1G), 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of hyaluronidase (StemCell Technologies, 07461) and 200 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, D5025-150KU) or using the tumour dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-096-730) followed by debris removal (Miltenyi, 130-109-398). Samples were run on a m_TDK_1 cycle and centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min after completion. The pellets were resuspended in cold PBS and filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer. The samples were washed twice using cold PBS and then manually counted using a haemocytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Isolation of splenocytes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole spleens were collected from euthanized mice and placed into cold RPMI medium. The spleens were then teased through a 70-µm filter and lysed for 5 min at 37 °C using 1× BD Pharmalyse buffer (BD, 555899). Lysis buffer was quenched with medium and centrifuged at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. Splenocytes were resuspended in cold PBS and filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer and washed once with PBS before being counted using the Beckman Coulter Vi-cell XR or haemocytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Mouse flow cytometry analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells from either tumours and spleens were placed into 96-well V-bottom plates. Unless stated otherwise, the washing steps were performed by centrifugation at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min at 4 °C followed by resuspension of cells with 200 µl of buffer, with mixing done by pipetting. Cells were washed with cold PBS and stained with 100 µl of live/dead stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L10119) for 30 min at 4 °C. Live/dead dye was quenched with 100 µl of cold PBS and the cells were washed once with cold FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended with 10 µl True stain FCX buffer (BioLegend, 422302) diluted to 100 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with FACS buffer for 10 min. Then 90 µl of antibodies (Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;) and Brilliant Stain buffer (BD, 563794) were added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, 100 µl of FACS buffer was added to each well and the cells were washed twice with cold FACS buffer. Cells were fixed for 15 min with 100 µl of Cytofix buffer (BD, 554655) at 4 °C. Next, 100 µl of PBS was added to each sample and cells were washed twice and stored in FACS buffer at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Initial compensation was acquired using Ultracomp eBeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 01-2222-42) and ArC amine reactive compensation beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10346). Results were acquired using a BD Symphony A3 and analysed using FlowJo v.10.8.1 and v.10.10.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Tetramer production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptides selected to be high-affinity binders for Survivin (ATFKNWPFL), GP100A (EGSRNQDWL), GP100B (KVPRNQDWL), WT1 (RMFPNAPYL), CLDN6 or claudin 6 (KVYDSLLAL) and TRP2 (SVYDFFVWL) were purchased from GenScript. H2-Db and H2-Kb monomers were purchased as easYmers from ImmunAware (5001-01 and 5004-01, respectively), and tetramers were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, peptides were reconstituted to 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in deionized water, further diluted to 75 μM and incubated with easYmer (Eagle Biosciences, 5004-01, 5001-01) at 18 °C for 48 h. The resulting complexes were tetramerized by gradually mixing with streptavidin-APC (BD Biosciences, 554067). After incubation, a final stock concentration of 500 nM for each tetramer was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Tetramer staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the manufacturer recommendations, 1–2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells were stained with tetramer diluted to 20 nM in FACS buffer. Cells were left to stain in the dark at room temperature for 1 h, washed once with FACS buffer, co-stained with surface antibodies (CD3, CD4) at room temperature for 20 min, washed twice with FACS buffer and analysed on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;AIM assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIM assay was performed as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

In this iteration, whole splenocytes were used rather than isolated T cells. In brief, 24 h after the last RNA-LNP vaccine, splenocytes were collected for antigen recall assay. Spleens were collected and processed as described above. 1 million splenocytes were cultured in a 96-well round-bottom plate in T cell medium containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco, 11-875-119), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35-011-CV), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 30-002-CI), 1% MEM non-essential amino acids (NEAA, Gibco, 11140050), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11360070), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (BME, Gibco, 21985-023) and 0.2 µg tumour-associated peptides without cytokines. Peptides were chosen based on their suggested upregulation in melanoma tumours&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Mendez-Gomez, H.

Selected peptides were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies and reconstituted according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Co-culture was maintained for 48 h in an incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cells were next collected and stained for the AIM assay for evaluating activation of antigen-specific T cells. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer containing antibodies mix (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;). Cells were washed three times and fixed using fixation medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, GAS001S100) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with PBS and were stored in FACS buffer at 4 °C in the dark until analysis. Results were acquired using a BD Fortessa III. Values were normalized by subtracting the percentage of AIM&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells of tbe DMSO-only controls from each treatment condition. Statistical analysis was performed using Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s T3 multiple-comparison test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;ELISA and multiplex analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma was analysed for cytokine concentration using ELISAs and multiplex cytokine arrays. A portion of the plasma samples were assessed for IFNα through ELISA (Invitrogen, BMS6027). Plasma was also sent for analysis by Eve Technologies for multiplex cytokine array (MD44). For quantification of spike IgG, mice that received three vaccines/vehicle doses during tumour studies were bled once the humane end point was reached. Spike-specific IgG was determined using an Anti-mouse SARS-CoV-2 IgG titre assay (AcroBiosystems, RAS-T023). Plasma was diluted 100,000-fold and run according to the company’s recommended parameters for semiquantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Immunofluorescence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of bisected tumours were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed three times using PBS and then immersed successively into 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose for cryopreservation. Tissue was then embedded in O.C.T. (Tissue-Tek, 4583) and stored at −80 °C. Blocks of tissue were moved to −20 °C for 24 h and were sectioned at a thickness of 30 µm using the Leica cryostat, and the sections were placed onto microscope slides. Before staining, the slides were brought up to room temperature for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Tissue was blocked at room temperature for 1 h using a blocking buffer containing 2% goat or donkey serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were then stained with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the sections were washed three times with PBS and stained with secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM1"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5 min PBS washes, the sections were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000 in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After a triple PBS wash, the sections were mounted with Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36984) and covered with a cover glass. Images were acquired using a Leica Stellaris 8 WLL Spectral Confocal Microscope. Image processing was performed using Fiji ImageJ software (NIH) and Imaris (Oxford Instruments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09655-y#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 15:36:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5xdzZ3ZXkxU2FUTjEtQlk3WGdkajJZNDdlZm5GWTJwWXIzbGdPZHZOSUFkcTFWd29yWjdkQUR1MzRNTGR2dXk3VEVyaTg4czJLQy1qTFlyaWd2Mi1CcWNF</guid></item></channel></rss>
