Almost 500 were later found dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Police say such cases have doubled since 2012, underscoring a growing strain on the world's oldest society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who wander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Robot caregivers and AI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Other technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Fujitsu's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Early detection of age-related diseases is key," says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. "If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a "future" caregiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change diapers and prevent bedsores in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Scientists at Waseda University in Tokyo are developing caregiving robots&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Similar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems," Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, though, human connection remains irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers," Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. "While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people," Mr Morita says. "Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Lineup of Sharp Poketomo robots at Ceatec in Chiba, Japan" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Sharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patients&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 01:04:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1SLUtScW1DSExRZTZrU0pXblZMeFFFTTh3NFBnU1R2bXRqNUphOTM0Qk41X2NOUHZScDZUSmRNQW04RlRyU3Y4WlM5SENUbWJ5NFo1QWtha1p4UdIBX0FVX3lxTFBvNkQ2SS1NRVdVVXZfMTZhdEdtTHVhekdWQ3hyVUktb3l4ZXpkb21JSFltMnI0QU5wWGtrOVMwR2ttZXJqMXZncFZOVVNnVTZvZjZRQ1FTcTZiakdYTzVV</guid></item><item><title>青少年因“笑”而陷入困境，因为哥哥在取笑她的体重后被惊讶的“业力”击中-雅虎生活方式加拿大</title><link>https://ca.style.yahoo.com/teen-gets-trouble-laughing-brother-230000463.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At just 17 years old, one woman had been constantly called “fat” by her family for years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her brother even went so far as to taunt her, saying she would die of diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then one day, he received unexpected news that she called “karma"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Family dynamics can be complicated, especially when issues of body image and health are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One Reddit user recently shared that her family constantly calls her "fat," all while her older brother’s unhealthy habits have gone unchecked – until an unexpected twist made her feel like "karma" had finally caught up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The 17-year-old poster explained that her family, specifically her 21-year-old brother, J, consistently criticizes her weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For the longest while ever since I started puberty my family would not stop calling me fat," she wrote.

However, she claimed that he "eats way more" than she does and rarely gets any exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, her family insists "that 'he's a growing boy, so he must eat.' ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over the years, the double standard extended to birthdays and meals. While she didn’t get cake, J did, and when she made dinner, she was told to cook extra so her brother could eat as much as he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The unfair treatment didn’t end there. The poster was blamed for finishing household food, no matter how little she actually consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“A whole liter of juice? finished by me even if I took only one cup. Snacks? I finished them. Leftover dinner? Me. Everything is always finished by me no matter how much I try to prove that I didn't do it,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over time, she stopped arguing, knowing it was pointless to fight against a family set on blaming her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Eventually I stopped putting up a fight because I knew it wasn't me and arguing with people who were dead set on believing you ate everything didn't get anywhere," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The story took a surprising turn when J began feeling unwell and went to the doctor, explaining that he was "feeling sluggish and dehydrated." After testing, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I watched as my mom and J stared at the lab results in utter shock and disbelief. J was so dumbfounded that I couldn't help but laugh,” the Reddit user revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"J and our mom looked at me with a mixture of shame and rage. My mom grabbed me and had me get a blood test as well because apparently if J had it so did I, but when the lab showed that I was healthy, I laughed even harder this time," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, her mom then told their entire extended family that she "laughed at my unfortunate brother instead of feeling sorry for him and now I'm being lashed out at by everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, she turned to Reddit to ask if she was in the wrong for laughing at his diagnosis or if she was justified, given his behavior toward her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock image of teenager at the doctor's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an edit, the user emphasized that her laughter didn’t mean she didn’t care about her brother’s diagnosis. She agreed that "diabetes is a serious condition," adding that she has been preparing her brother's meals since his diagnosis to ensure he is on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I make sure to give him stuff that won't raise his sugar and cause any further complications, just because I laughed at him and he has a history of being my biggest hater, doesn't mean that I don't love my brother, he is still my family at the end of the day," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, her post sparked a mix of reactions online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some users felt her brother got karma for bullying her, while others argued that laughing at a serious health issue was inappropriate, highlighting the delicate balance of fairness in complicated family dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/teen-laughs-at-older-brothers-health-diagnosis-reddit-11859624" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPckNnTWowWU1rUkJVVG9DM3JHVDI0d3FXTEFqY3Y5TUtUSzN6WE9EU0U5T25GX1M1RDlmejZPMlpYYXNCeWtYSjFiRFBZVlBZbW56VUZtaUpETmp5STZLYXA0MlVxSWVYdUlMMXg3WHlNTkdpa3FxbzR3X0dROEJrMDhn</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，笑气可以立即缓解抑郁症- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/laughing-gas-can-offer-immediate-relief-from-depression-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A review by researchers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford in the UK has found that controlled doses of laughing gas (or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"&gt;nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt;) really can provide quick-acting relief from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="184148" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment seems to be viable over longer periods of time, with repeated doses, and can be effective in individuals with both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) – some of the people who are hardest to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/women-have-twice-as-many-depression-genes-as-men-says-largest-of-its-kind-study"&gt;Women Have Twice as Many Depression Genes as Men, Says Largest-of-Its-Kind Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This population has often lost hope of recovery, making the results of this study particularly exciting," &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/clinical-use-of-nitrous-oxide-could-help-treat-depression-major-study-shows"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; consultant psychiatrist Steven Marwaha, from the University of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings highlight the urgent need for new treatments that can complement existing care pathways, and further evidence is needed to understand how this approach can best support people living with severe depression."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184152" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184152" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronDiagram.jpg" alt="Neuron diagram" class="wp-image-184152 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronDiagram-600x622.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184152" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Laughing gas (represented by the red circles) may work against depression by dampening signaling between neurons. (Gill et al., &lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers evaluated seven  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="184148" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; involving 247 participants in total, as well as four plans for future trials known as protocol papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the trials, selected volunteers inhaled nitrous oxide at concentrations of either 50 percent or 25 percent, with the effects compared to volunteers who had inhaled a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;form of placebo&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher of the two concentrations typically alleviated depression's symptoms better, but often came with more side effects, including nausea, headaches, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depersonalization-disorder-what-we-know-about-mysterious-condition"&gt;feelings of dissociation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that administering the gas helped reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in as little as two hours. Relief was relatively short-lived, with symptoms returning within the week unless the dose was repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study brings together the best possible evidence indicating that nitrous oxide has the potential to provide swift and clinically significant short-term improvements in patients with severe depression," &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/clinical-use-of-nitrous-oxide-could-help-treat-depression-major-study-shows"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical psychologist Kiranpreet Gill, from the University of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more in-depth analysis is required, the researchers suggest the treatment's effects may be related to the way nitrous oxide calms down the glutamatergic system – a key component of the nervous system &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.07.036"&gt;already linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughing gas is also known to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x18789273"&gt;increase blood flow&lt;/a&gt;, which may help cycle gases, waste, and nutrients through the brain. Once scientists understand more about why this works, treatments may become tailored to individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is certain is that new treatments are urgently needed. The new study highlights the increasing burden of depression, which is now the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression"&gt;more than 300 million people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our analyses show that nitrous oxide could form part of a new generation of rapid-acting treatments for depression," &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/clinical-use-of-nitrous-oxide-could-help-treat-depression-major-study-shows"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Gill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, it provides a foundation for future trials to investigate repeated and carefully managed dosing strategies that can further determine how best to use this treatment in clinical practice for patients who don't respond to conventional interventions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.106023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a general rule of thumb, home expert Aaron Lipman says to keep it away from vents and at least three feet from your bed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The airflow from vents can disrupt the mist and reduce its effectiveness," he says, and having it too close to your bed can lead to "over-exposure to moisture, which could irritate breathing during sleep."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The goal of running a humidifier is balancing the ideal conditions for your home with the ideal conditions for feeling comfortable yourself, so &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/room-humidifier-shopping-1908137" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;it depends on what room&lt;/a&gt; you'd like it in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Asif Bux, owner of Comfort Union HVAC service company, adds that you should also keep portable humidifiers away from windows, since &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/condensation-on-windows-8742997" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the humidity can condense&lt;/a&gt; on cold surfaces or get blown away unevenly by airflow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have wooden floors or antique wooden furniture, a humidifier can help with shrinkage and cracking that gets exacerbated by dry air, but Lipman says you'll want to have a tray or waterproof mat beneath it. This will stop any warping and keep spills or condensation from causing other forms of damage.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The ideal percentage range for a humidifier in winter is between 30% and 50%. Much of it will depend on the climate where you live, the kind of home or apartment you have, and what your needs are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bux also adds that you'll be more likely to notice the dry air and there will be more static electricity, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A higher percentage can lead to mold and mildew. Both experts recommend having a hygrometer to help you keep an eye on levels. A built-in humidifier, however, is capable of managing humidity levels on its own.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, a humidifier can be a super useful tool to make your home (and sinuses) more comfortable and keep the interiors damage-free during winter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Running a humidifier can alleviate these issues and make your home feel warmer, even at slightly lower temperatures—helping you save on energy bills," says Bux.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lipman agrees that a humidifier is extremely helpful, but notes that it should be approached with caution, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Over-humidification can cause condensation on windows, seepage into walls, and invite mold growth," he says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping a watchful eye and ensuring you have the right settings is key for a seamless experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you're aware of the best settings and placement for your humidifier, here are a few other pointers for keeping your humidifier running smoothly and boosting your air quality throughout winter:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about the room. &lt;/strong&gt;If you're shopping for a new humidifier, think about the size of the room it'll be in as you'll want to buy a humidifier with the right capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean it regularly. &lt;/strong&gt;Lipman notes it's important to &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-clean-a-humidifier-8746032" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regularly clean your humidifier&lt;/a&gt; to cut down on bacteria buildup. Aim to do so every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain cleanliness. &lt;/strong&gt;Bux says you should use distilled or filtered water in portable humidifiers "to reduce mineral buildup and white dust."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider other air gadgets. &lt;/strong&gt;Think about getting an &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-air-purifiers-4062977" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;air purifier&lt;/a&gt; for your home to work in tandem with a humidifier; these can clear out bacteria, viruses, mold, and dust, which often feel more prevalent during winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate maintenance on whole-house humidifiers. &lt;/strong&gt;If you have a whole-home humidifier, Bux recommends scheduling in annual maintenance with your technician to ensure everything is working properly. It's best to do so before the times of year when you'll need it most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Spruce</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE0zT2kyaDhva29WOTRST21RTGdWb3lqV3p0M1ZOWElhcGxZZmFvTnlRaVppUjRUckpETF9IOUo1Tnp0eHBoVjF1WDZSSURqek0wNjBtMlVkNm5na2ZFOG93OXJqVkVEZjJkaWgyM0NIbWxNazI1Tk1PaGNB</guid></item><item><title>新研究确定了每天服用多种维生素的实际受益者- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/new-research-identifies-who-actually-benefits-from-daily-multivitamins/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 19:41:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQlh1U0FLU3loRzJMOHJYMzAyRGQzaWU1eXJWdmYySXpnMHZqOFgtclp6a3B2dHY4U09aeVVLNVlfTmJPM1BoNjQ2Rm4zaEx1TGNiX0xLT05RY0pQM1dZN2VnRmo3OW9hOFlPNUl5eVliRUFUVkY5QzV4bmwyUzNGenAyaTIwWGhMbzlaZU5BYXBxQkpNaHcxTVZuY1g</guid></item><item><title>7种富含镁的食物有助于改善您的睡眠和情绪- GQ</title><link>https://www.gq.com/story/7-magnesium-rich-foods-to-help-improve-your-sleep-and-your-mood-1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of supporting GABA production, Dryden says that magnesium helps convert the amino acid tryptophan into serotonin, which then gets converted into melatonin, a hormone that’s crucial for sleep because it signals to the body that it’s nighttime and helps regulate the body’s internal clock (known as circadian rhythm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though magnesium doesn’t directly produce melatonin, it’s really important in helping that process get done and if we don’t get enough magnesium, that process might not happen as efficiently,” Dryden says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dryden says that research has shown that magnesium can help improve sleep efficiency, reducing the time it takes to fall asleep and decreasing the number of wake-up times throughout the night. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8996025/"&gt;2021 study published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; taking into account roughly 4,000 people backs this up, showing that participants who supplemented with magnesium experienced higher quality sleep than participants who didn’t supplement with magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 magnesium-rich foods worth adding to your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, it’s best to get magnesium through diet versus supplements because you’ll be consuming other important nutrients at the same time. The magnesium-rich foods included here all have other nutrients that either support sleep, mood, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Pumpkin seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds top both Pratt and Dryden’s lists for the best magnesium-rich foods for better mood and sleep. &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/"&gt;It has more magnesium than any other food&lt;/a&gt;, with 156 milligrams per serving, or 37% of the recommended daily value. “Pumpkin seeds also contain tryptophan, which is an amino acid that’s important for relaxation and sleep,” Dryden says. If you don’t plan on carving any pumpkins this fall, pumpkin seeds are easy to find at most grocery stores. They make a nice, crunchy topper for salads, oatmeal, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Chia seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another seed that’s high in magnesium is chia seeds. “Two tablespoons of chia seeds is going to give you a pretty decent amount of magnesium,” Dryden says. Besides magnesium, she says that these tiny seeds are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain function and decreasing inflammation—both important for avoiding depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Leafy greens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One magnesium-rich food Kriegler recommends is leafy greens because it’s super versatile and high in many other important nutrients, including &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-fiber-diet-2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;. You probably already know how important fiber is for gut health. Due to the strong connection between &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gut-health"&gt;gut health and brain health&lt;/a&gt;, a thriving microbiome is crucial for mood regulation.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows that eating more fruit is linked to a lower risk of kidney disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red grapes, apples, berries, lemons and pineapple are lower in potassium for kidney health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple strategies like fruit salads and smoothies make it easy to add these fruits to your daily routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your kidneys work hard every day to filter waste and support overall health. These bean-shaped organs perform the crucial task of removing toxins, balancing fluids and maintaining the right levels of essential nutrients in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And the foods you eat can make a big difference when it comes to taking care of your kidneys. Fruits, in particular, offer a powerful combination of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber that help protect these vital organs. "A study looked at data from over 98,000 participants and found that eating more fruit was associated with a 6 to 8% lower risk of developing kidney disease," says &lt;a href="https://www.plantpoweredkidneys.com/meet-jen/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jen Hernandez, RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But not all fruits are created equal when it comes to kidney health. Here are the ones experts say offer the most benefit—and easy ways to enjoy them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-red-grapes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Red Grapes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Red grapes pack a kidney-friendly punch thanks to a special plant compound. "Red grapes contain the phytochemical resveratrol, which supports kidney health," says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-hetrick-ms-rd-ldn-60710031/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Hetrick, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; throughout the body, including in the kidneys.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These bite-sized fruits are also low in potassium compared to many other fruits, making them a smart choice for kidney health. Enjoy them fresh as a snack, freeze them for a cool treat or toss them into salads for a burst of sweetness. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-apples-11810716" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;apple a day&lt;/a&gt; might do more than keep the doctor away—it could help your kidneys, too. "Apples have anti-inflammatory properties and soluble fiber, which can help lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels," says Hetrick.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Both of these benefits are vital for diabetic and hypertensive kidney disease,” says &lt;a href="https://sportsnephrology.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Raeeda Gheewala, M.D&lt;/a&gt;. High blood pressure and diabetes are two of the leading causes of kidney disease, so managing these conditions through diet can have a protective effect on kidney function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The soluble fiber in apples also supports digestive health and helps you feel full longer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-blueberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Blueberries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These tiny berries deliver a big impact when it comes to kidney protection. "Blueberries are high in anthocyanins and vitamin C, which offer strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits," says Gheewala. Anthocyanins are the compounds that give blueberries their deep blue color, and they work to combat oxidative stress and inflammation that can damage kidney cells over time. "Research has shown that people who consumed more fruits like berries and apples had a 16% lower risk of developing chronic kidney disease thanks to the flavonoids from these fruits," says Hernandez.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether fresh or frozen, blueberries are an easy addition to breakfast bowls, yogurt or smoothies.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-lemons"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Lemons  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These tart citrus fruits offer unique benefits for kidney health, particularly when it comes to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-to-prevent-kidney-stones-11705389" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;. "These citrus fruits provide citrate, which can reduce kidney stone formation and enhance hydration," says Gheewala. Citric acid may help inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, adding lemon to your water makes staying hydrated more enjoyable, and proper hydration is one of the most important things you can do for your kidneys. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; in lemons (and limes!) also provides antioxidant protection.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tropical fruit brings both flavor and function to a kidney-friendly diet. "Pineapple is a kidney-friendly fruit that I often recommend. It's rich in vitamin C, manganese, dietary fiber and contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant phytochemicals that support kidney health," says Hernandez. Pineapple also contains bromelain, an enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Like red grapes, pineapple is lower in potassium than many other fruits, which can be important for people monitoring their potassium intake. Its natural sweetness makes it a satisfying option for dessert or snacks.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don't let their small size fool you—raspberries are fiber powerhouses. "They are considered one of the highest fiber fruits with 8 grams of fiber per 1 cup serving!&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber is important in regulating blood sugars and promoting regularity. Blood sugar stabilization is crucial in preserving kidney function for those patients with diabetes," says &lt;a href="https://www.michigankidney.com/about-us/dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alex Evink, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Diabetes is a major risk factor for kidney disease, so keeping blood sugar levels stable through high-fiber foods like raspberries can help protect kidney function over time.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These berries also provide vitamin C, manganese and antioxidants that fight inflammation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ready to boost your kidney health with these fruits? Here are expert-approved ways to make them part of your daily routine:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix and match:&lt;/strong&gt; "A fruit salad or smoothie is a great way to incorporate a variety of fruits together to be a nutritionally dense superfood," says Hetrick. Combine several of the fruits above for maximum benefit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Season wisely:&lt;/strong&gt; "Add lemon or lime juice to meals to enhance flavor instead of added salt," says Gheewala. This simple swap supports kidney health while adding brightness to everything from fish to vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prep for success:&lt;/strong&gt; "Buy fresh fruit in season for the cheapest and best quality options. Wash with water as soon as you get home and chop, placing in clear containers front-and-center of your fridge so you always see it as a quick option when looking for a snack," says Hernandez.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bake with fruit:&lt;/strong&gt; "Add applesauce to muffins or baked goods," says Evink. This adds natural sweetness and moisture while reducing the need for added sugar and fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock the freezer:&lt;/strong&gt; "Don't forget that frozen fruit is picked at its peak ripeness and can frequently be a more affordable option that doesn't go bad like its fresh counterparts," says Hernandez. Frozen berries are perfect for smoothies and require zero prep work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-to-talk-to-a-health-care-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; When to Talk to a Health Care Provider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these fruits offer benefits for kidney health, it's important to recognize that individual needs can vary, especially for people with existing kidney disease. "If someone has a more advanced stage of chronic kidney disease, they may need to limit potassium intake. Potassium is a standard lab test, and patients should speak to their physician about their levels," says Hetrick.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Anyone with CKD, high potassium, or on dialysis—or who takes blood pressure or potassium-altering medications—should consult a nephrologist or renal dietitian before major dietary changes," says Gheewala. A registered dietitian who specializes in kidney health can help you create a personalized eating plan that supports your specific needs while still including delicious, nourishing foods.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your kidneys work around the clock to keep your body healthy, and the fruits you eat can support this vital function. Red grapes, apples, blueberries, lemons and limes, pineapple and raspberries all offer unique compounds—from resveratrol and fiber to antioxidants—that protect kidney health and reduce the risk of kidney disease. Research shows that people who eat more fruit have a lower risk of developing kidney problems, making these colorful foods a smart addition to your daily routine. Simple strategies like keeping washed fruit visible in your fridge, adding lemon juice to meals and choosing frozen options can make it easy to enjoy these kidney-friendly picks every day. Just remember that if you have existing kidney disease or take certain medications, working with a health care provider ensures your diet supports your individual needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The research is also showing that if you have two groups of individuals, someone who has comorbid metabolic diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, versus somebody who doesn’t, and both of these individuals have dementia, the rates of progression of dementia in somebody who doesn’t have metabolic risk factors tend to be slower,” explained Fesharaki-Zadeh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to make changes and corrections, he noted, whether you’re a young, seemingly healthy person, in your 80s or 90s, or someone who has already been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains are highly malleable, Fesharaki-Zadeh said.

			&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus may increase stress levels by keeping the body that much closer to a fight-or-flight response to sound, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By carefully studying the facial expressions of people with &lt;span&gt;and without tinnitus&lt;/span&gt;, scientists have found a pattern of altered involuntary facial movements and pupil dilation associated with distress and threat assessment in those with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, by cataloguing the facial movements of their tinnitus participants, the team of researchers, led by neuroscientist Daniel Polley of Mass General Brigham in the US, was even able to predict the severity of the ear-ringing condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tinnitus Is Somehow Linked to a Crucial Bodily Function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that people with debilitating chronic tinnitus experience heightened vigilance and react to normal, everyday sounds as though they were threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-tinnitus-facial-eye-biomarkers-could-unlock-testing-treatments"&gt;Polley says&lt;/a&gt;, "we directly observed a signature of tinnitus severity. When we began this study, we didn't know if sounds would elicit facial movements; so, to discover that these movements not only occur, but can provide the most informative measure to date of tinnitus distress, is quite surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is a condition in which a constant buzzing, clicking, or high-pitched ringing can be heard in one or both ears (but not by anyone else).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knows what causes it, and it currently has no objective clinical biomarkers, since tinnitus is a purely subjective experience, like migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine if  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183755" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; severity were determined by giving patients a questionnaire – this is the state of affairs for some common neurological disorders like tinnitus," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-tinnitus-facial-eye-biomarkers-could-unlock-testing-treatments"&gt;Polley says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350162"&gt;difficult to diagnose&lt;/a&gt; and even more challenging to track over time. There is also no known cure, although some sufferers report symptom reductions or&lt;span&gt; better symptom management&lt;/span&gt; after trying &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/tinnitus"&gt;sound therapy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-202406053047"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007330"&gt;tinnitus retraining therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-and-what-to-do-about-it"&gt;Almost everyone&lt;/a&gt; will experience tinnitus at some point in their lives, but for most people, it will be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is when the condition lasts for at least six months, and it affects more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2022.2189"&gt;120 million people around the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also notoriously &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/14164-tinnitus"&gt;frustrating for patients&lt;/a&gt;, and treatment options are inconsistent, which can leave some people feeling dismissed or unsupported in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it's severe enough to disrupt sleep and interfere with daily activities, with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0um3YAzHJzA"&gt;strong links to depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any clue that can help doctors understand the condition may bring us closer to knowing its causes, which could then help with the development of new, more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human faces undergo a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microexpression"&gt;microexpressions&lt;/a&gt;: vanishingly brief, involuntary twitches that can reveal strong emotions, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, scientists have also made headway in using facial cues to diagnose the severity of conditions that lack clear clinical biomarkers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-melancholia-depression-can-be-diagnosed-by-facial-expression"&gt;severe depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polley and his team adopted a similar approach for studying tinnitus. They recruited 97 study participants – 47 with tinnitus or sound sensitivity, and 50 without – and made them listen to a range of sounds from a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1027-6"&gt;previously compiled database&lt;/a&gt; of emotionally evocative audio recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sounds all have assigned associations, from positive sounds such as soft music and laughter, through more neutral sounds such as background chatter, rustling paper, and kitchen sounds, to unpleasant sounds such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01643-0"&gt;screeching metal&lt;/a&gt;, sirens, and alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-could-be-our-brains-way-of-coping-with-nerve-damage"&gt;Tinnitus Could Be Our Brain's Way of Coping With Nerve Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While listening to these sounds, each participant had their facial expressions tracked, and their eyes recorded to look for signs of pupil dilation as the body shifts into threat assessment mode. Then, AI software was used to tease out tiny changes in facial expression that human eyes might miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control group of tinnitus-free participants tended to show microexpressions consistent with the emotional association of each sound: a slight smile for pleasant sounds, and a slight frown for unpleasant sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the tinnitus participants showed markedly reduced facial changes compared to the control group, regardless of how pleasant or unpleasant the sound was. Meanwhile, their pupils dilated extra wide for all sounds – again, no matter the category. The pupils of the control group dilated only for the most unpleasant, loudest sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these markers individually – the lack of facial expression and the exaggerated pupil response – enabled the scientists to gauge not just &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; or not a participant had tinnitus, but how severely they were impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popular idea in tinnitus research is that, in response to hearing loss, the brain &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/tinnitus-ringing-in-the-ears-and-what-to-do-about-it"&gt;'turns up' its auditory pathways to compensate&lt;/a&gt; (although not all cases of tinnitus are associated with hearing loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this proposed mechanism cannot predict the severity of the condition, suggesting it may be only part of the overall picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tinnitus is likely to be a complex condition, with a wide range of causes and presentations. The work of Polley and his team fills in some of the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These biomarkers get to the root of the distress," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-tinnitus-facial-eye-biomarkers-could-unlock-testing-treatments"&gt;Polley says&lt;/a&gt;. "While imaging might show hyperactive brain regions in tinnitus patients, these biomarkers reveal body-wide threat evaluation systems that are operating outside of their normal range, leading to the distressful symptoms they experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp1934"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The biggest mistake you’re making is choosing the wrong form of vitamin D supplement. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D3 is from animals, and it is the type you make from the sun, which is absorbed better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose an independently-tested supplement or add fatty fish and fortified foods to your diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might be doing everything right—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;taking a vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt;, drinking milk, eating salmon and soaking up midday rays. On the surface, it seems like you’ve got your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D bases covered&lt;/a&gt;. Yet almost 25% of people in the United States are running low. Vitamin D plays far more roles in the body than you may realize.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

“While its claim to fame is often associated with the role it plays in protecting bone health through helping the body absorb calcium, that’s not all you need vitamin D for,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/elizabeth-shaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Elizabeth Shaw, M.S., RDN, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s also involved in communication in the body, muscle movement and immune health. In fact, you need vitamin D to help kick free radicals out of your body, like the common cold and flu, so you can stay healthy.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even if you’re taking a vitamin D supplement like clockwork every day, you still might not be absorbing enough.  According to experts, the biggest mistake people are making is choosing the wrong form of vitamin D. So, which one should you be choosing? Here, we break down the differences between the two types of vitamin D and which one you should be reaching for. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-difference-between-vitamin-d2-and-d3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Difference Between Vitamin D2 and D3 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;When you look at vitamin D supplements options, you may notice two forms available: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. While both can help raise and maintain vitamin D levels, they come from different sources and your body utilizes them differently. Below we explore what sets the two apart. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin D2 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D2, also known by its scientific name ergocalciferol, comes primarily from plant-based sources. “Vitamin D2 is photosynthesized in plants, mushrooms and yeasts. In other words, mushrooms exposed to sunlight synthesize vitamin D2,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.lifeextension.com/wellness/authors/holli-ryan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holli Ryan, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both D2 and D3 must undergo two steps to become biologically active: first, conversion in the liver, then again in the kidney. However, once activated, research shows that vitamin D3 is more effective at raising and maintaining 25(OH)D levels, which is your blood serum vitamin D status. Vitamin D2 has structural differences that reduce its ability to bind to vitamin D-binding protein, and it also breaks down more quickly. Its shorter half-life means it doesn’t stay in your system as long either. Ultimately, making it the less-than-desirable option.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin D3  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol, is found in animal-based foods such as salmon, tuna, herring, egg yolks, and cheese, as well as in fortified foods like dairy milk and orange juice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also the form your body naturally produces when you get some rays. “Vitamin D3 is closer to the form your body naturally makes from sunlight, so it’s more efficient at supporting and maintaining vitamin D levels,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bonnie-taub-dix-11796963" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the body can use both forms of vitamin D, studies show that vitamin D3 can raise blood levels of vitamin D higher and for longer than vitamin D2, says Shaw. In fact, guidelines indicate that vitamin D3 is approximately five times more potent at raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations, compared to D2.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With nearly 5% of the population at risk of vitamin D deficiency and another 18% with insufficient levels, maintaining adequate levels is a widespread problem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Vitamin D plays multiple critical roles in health, from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting strong bones&lt;/a&gt; to bolstering immune health to aiding with muscle movement. When levels run low, it may lead to weakened immunity, fatigue, or low mood. That’s why choosing the right form of vitamin D is so important.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few expert-backed tips to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help guide you&lt;/a&gt; towards picking up the right vitamin D supplement.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for independently tested brands&lt;/strong&gt;: Start by choosing a supplement verified by a trusted independent testing organization. “Labels from testing organizations, like NSF certified or USP, mean you know what’s on the label is in the bottle,” says Shaw. This helps ensure you’re choosing a safe, high-quality option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose D3:&lt;/strong&gt; Check that the supplement is in D3 form. “It should read ‘cholecalciferol’ if it has the D3 form,” Shaw points out.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find vegan-friendly D3&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re vegan, look for an algae-derived vitamin D3 supplement, since most D3 supplements are derived from lanolin (sheep’s wool), says Ryan. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a form you’ll take consistently: &lt;/strong&gt;Softgels and liquid drops are both good options;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;choose the form you’ll take most comfortably and consistently, advises Taub-Dix. And “check with your healthcare provider to determine what dose is right for you,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with fat in your diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Once you’ve found a tried and true supplement, don’t forget to pair it with fat. “Because vitamin D is fat-soluble, I always remind people to pair these foods with a source of healthy fat to support absorption,” says Shaw. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-ways-to-get-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Ways to Get Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to choosing the right vitamin D supplement, your diet, beverage choices and scheduling in sunshine time can help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost your vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dive into fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt;: Salmon, trout, sardines, herring and tuna are all &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the whole egg&lt;/strong&gt;: The yolk contains several nutrients, including vitamin D.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try wild or UVB-treated mushrooms:&lt;/strong&gt; Wild mushrooms naturally contain vitamin D2 and UVB-treated varieties can contain high amounts of vitamin D too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink milk: &lt;/strong&gt;Dairy milk is typically fortified with vitamin D. Plant-based milks may also be fortified - check the label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose fortified cereals: &lt;/strong&gt;Many ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contain added vitamin D. Look for it on the nutrition facts panel.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a glass of OJ&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking 100% fortified orange juice can give you not only vitamin D but also calcium. &lt;strong&gt;(2,5)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule sunlight time:&lt;/strong&gt; While sunlight is a free and natural way to get vitamin D, several variables can make it challenging to rely on alone. Age, skin pigmentation, geographical location, sunscreen use, body fat percentage and the season all affect how much vitamin D your skin produces, says Ryan. “Exposing your skin to UVB rays from the sunlight for around 15 minutes daily without sunscreen can be helpful, but be sure to avoid excessive sun exposure without protecting your skin”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Monitor your levels regularly with a blood test to ensure you are maintaining adequate vitamin D levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The number one mistake people make when taking vitamin D is choosing the wrong form. Experts recommend selecting a vitamin D3 supplement over D2 for maximum benefit and absorption. Research states vitamin D3 is five times more potent than vitamin D2, and more effective at raising and maintaining blood vitamin D levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When picking out a supplement, make sure it’s independently tested, contains the D3 form, and comes in either soft or drop form. Other ways to boost your vitamin D levels are by eating fatty fish, mushrooms or drinking fortified milk or orange juice. Aim for at least 15 minutes of sunlight exposure a day. And don’t forget to monitor your vitamin D levels annually, as vitamin D plays a role in whole-body health.

I didn’t ask about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 38, a neurologist told me I have degenerative disc disease in my cervical spine that is so bad it looked like I spent years wrangling a jackhammer on a construction site. As a suburban mom and college professor, what could I have possibly done in life to contribute to this condition? Carry a growing baby in the björn and a toddler on my hip as I ran in and out of Target? Lug my entire office in a tote bag from class to class across campus? It has never been clear. So it made sense that the acupuncturist assumed all of my neck pain radiated from the bulging discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I brought up with Jade, though, was my tumor site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was in college,” I told her, “I had a malignant tumor removed from the base of my skull.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea,” Jade said with surprise. “Did you have physical therapy?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, I didn’t. It was so long ago, and I was so young,” I explained. “The surgeon removed a chunk of my scalp and it wasn’t until 10 years later that I realized he had actually removed part of my occipital bone, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stood close behind me, giving me time and space to put two and two together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is it possible that I have simultaneous issues causing my pain and discomfort?” I asked. “Could my decades-old surgery have anything to do with the chronic throbs I always feel on both sides of my neck?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jade sat me at the edge of the table and turned my head right, then down, then left as she ran the tip of her pointer finger along each side of my hanging head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood rushed into my cheeks. I fumbled for an answer to her unexpected question. Hearing no audible objection from me, Jade tenderly parted my hair. Her thumbs pushed inside the lime-sized hole in my head, precisely tracing the suboccipital muscles to see where they had reattached themselves after my surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;This is the photo that the author submitted to accompany her melanoma community profile.

I shifted on the table. It was probably my surgical oncologist. Who even knows that skin graft is there? My family, of course, but who else? My hairdresser? She is probably the only one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engrossed by the sea foam color sunlit on the wavy glass of the window, I sat transfixed. The soft spa sounds of lapping waves and sea birds chirping circulated in the room as I half listened to Jade speak about the physical trauma to my head and neck and the surgical scar that has now been part of my body for more than half my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t until we uncover old trauma like this and begin to treat it that we can truly heal,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Jade was clearly referring to my physical body, her words synonymously triggered thoughts about something else too — the scars she can’t see on the inside. It has finally dawned on me that, even after continuously interacting with the world and understanding how it has shaped me, I never truly realized that surviving cancer as a young adult could still have an enormous impact on my life decades later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for people to not realize how much previous traumas affect them? &lt;a href="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Trauma-infographic.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68fd1945e4b011e80886928d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Trauma-infographic.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;According to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;, 70% of adults in the U.S. have experienced some type of traumatic event at least once in their lives. That’s 235.1 million people. Trauma, then, is more universal than we probably realize. And while some people do not remember traumatic or painful experiences from the past at all, many others work to understand the potential effects on their lives. But do these attempts to understand what they’ve been through automatically translate into true healing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of these efforts, emotions and thoughts we ignore or push down can still manifest physically, sometimes as tension, fatigue, or even illness. In other words, “your body expresses what your mind suppresses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/loroxburgh/reel/C7znvUzSqP7/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Lauren Roxburgh" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68fd1945e4b011e80886928d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/loroxburgh/reel/C7znvUzSqP7/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Lauren Roxburgh&lt;/a&gt;, international body alignment expert and wellness educator dubbed The Body Whisperer. And while repressed memories may not be readily accessible, they can sometimes resurface later in life, often triggered by specific cues or situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in my acupuncturist’s office, I was suddenly aware that I had been holding that broken girl deep inside of me for too long. I felt ready to reconnect with her, to write her back into my story. As the mother of four children around the same age as when I was diagnosed with cancer, I see pieces of her in them. Each of them are navigating all the challenges that come with new adulthood — finding your own identity, learning to navigate new and old relationships, and developing emotional and financial independence. All of that was happening for me back then, too. How did I manage a cancer diagnosis on top of everything else? How could the 19-year-old me have juggled those balls and not have expected one to drop? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, age 19, just a few weeks before her biopsy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Jennifer Young"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Jennifer Young&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rush of memories released as Jade carefully pushed the slender points of filiform into the narrows of my neck. I thought back to my 19-year-old self and realized she and I still have a lot in common. She had to borrow wisps of hair from behind her ears to bobby pin over the bald spot on the back of her head every time she twisted up her hair. I still do that. She had to carefully cover the pockmarks on her shoulders from the vaccine shots with just-long-enough capped sleeves. I do that, too. She always yanked at her swimsuit to cover the square skin graft scar on her left butt cheek. Guess what? It still shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how did it never occur to me until this moment that the emotional trauma I endured as a young adult was even bigger and brighter than every blemish on my body? And while I am grateful to now have nurturing practitioners to help ease my physical pain, I realized that every time I worked to cover up these imperfections so that no one can see them, I stashed those old painful feelings beneath metal hairpins and bathing suit bottoms at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desperate to put as much space as possible between my trauma and the rest of my life, I thought I had to erase that chapter entirely. How would it feel if instead I paid closer attention to the cues my body has been giving me and worked to acknowledge that heartbreak from long ago?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although today many people are better at recognizing the emotional and psychological impacts of trauma like cancer has, I believe there are many others like me who never gave themselves that grace. Psychiatrist and author &lt;a href="https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68fd1945e4b011e80886928d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Bessel Van Der Kolk, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, underscores this notion in his bestselling book “The Body Keeps the Score”: “... trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being mirrored, and not being taken into account.” Is releasing these trapped emotions the key to restoring balance and well-being? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems like a no-brainer that missing bone from the back of my head was one likely cause of upper body pain for all of these years. But having my very own ah-ha moment in the least expected time and place is not lost on me, and what Jade has been saying gets through: A textbook understanding of trauma is not enough. True healing will only come if I accept every scar and allow each version of myself to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My physical wounds healed long ago, of course, but I now understand that scars — both physical and emotional — are stories our bodies carry, even when we’d prefer them to stay untold. Old traumas heal, it seems, not when we hide our scars, but when we finally let them speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that moment at my acupuncturist’s office, I’ve started unpacking this chapter more intentionally — reflecting on it, writing about it, and having honest conversations I used to avoid. It’s helped. I even worked up the courage to submit a survivor profile to a melanoma community on Instagram — including a photo that showed the scar on the back of my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I almost hit delete a dozen times! But I didn’t, and the multitude of likes and messages I received connected me to others whose lives had been touched by cancer — and, unexpectedly, it felt like that 19-year-old version of me was connected to them too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healing isn’t about going back; it’s about bringing every part of myself forward. And for the first time in a long time, that feels possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband married after she reached five years in remission.

It causes an irregular heart rhythm (also known as atrial fibrillation) sometimes in otherwise healthy people after excessive or binge drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binge drinking ― which is common around the holidays ― is known to cause this issue.

People are more likely to have heart attacks around earthquakes, sporting events, after elections and “we also see an increase in heart attacks around the holidays,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Chronic stress can increase blood pressure, elevate heart rate and raise cortisol levels, all of which contribute to heart disease over time,” Shetty said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress can also disrupt your sleep — and sleep is crucial for so many aspects of our health, including our heart health.

If not well protected, the cold can cause ... narrowing of the blood vessels, causing one’s heart rate and blood pressure to rise,” Shetty said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This puts extra strain on the heart, which may not be tolerated by those with heart conditions such as angina or heart failure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoveling heavy snow can also cause heart problems in susceptible people, according to Tawakol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s cold out, it’s important that you dress warmly to reduce strain on your heart, Spelsberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: ljubaphoto via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;ljubaphoto via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Drinking too much alcohol can cause heart issues such as irregular heartbeat. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s important that you create a relaxing routine during the holiday season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that holiday &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/stress" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="stress" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6931b52fe4b0824b6df84e5e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/stress" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; makes folks’ heart health worse. To deal with stress during the holidays (and all year), create a toolkit of all the things that help you feel less stressed, Jackson recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Get your tool set all together so that when that stressful time comes, you can pull out the tools that work for you,” Jackson said. This could be meditation, breathing exercises, daily walks, music, puzzles, she noted, but you know what works best for you. If a cup of tea and your go-to comfort show is what you need to decompress, do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if the stress of the holidays still gets under your skin, these stress-reducing activities still have benefit. Habits that help you cope, such as better sleep, exercise and mindfulness, have all been shown to make you less sensitive to the physical consequences of stress, therefore less at risk for heart issues, Tawakol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a healthy heart during the holiday season (and all year round) is all about balance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To maintain heart health during the holidays, practice moderation by limiting alcohol and rich foods while balancing with healthier options,” Spelsberg said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean not having a cookie or a slice of pie, instead it means having some fruit with your dessert or a big salad along with a decadent meal. Think of what you can add to your plate for nourishment rather than subtracting foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most guidelines say women should have no more than one drink a day and men should have no more than two, Jackson added, “but even most days of the week, not having that drink is probably healthier for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond your diet, commit to some exercise throughout the holiday season and be aware of heart attack symptoms, Spelsberg noted. If you notice chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or heart palpitations, don’t ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s important to get checked by a health care professional. Early intervention can make a significant difference in preventing long-term cardiac complications,” Shetty said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;The holidays are a time for joy, and by taking a proactive approach to your heart health, you can enjoy them without compromising your well-being,” Shetty continued. “Remember, small changes and mindful habits can go a long way in protecting your heart, not just now, but for years to come.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPSGNtaGlpdEszU1dkVk81Q1pfMzRKSXVzcTZJZVp3ZTZWeXoxUjYtbmt4eVZtdFVhWVNydm5JNzNOUmpUTGs2a2RsWHYwMG15UE9IcFQwbEl4LXFwdldhVlVMVHNFVVhNZk1ydDJqWmNSaE4tMzZDOHlyOWxtcWMtTVFfNUxHU1ZvS3czcU1UelRDeFpTRWJLdjkxYWlObnNyOFVocdIBqgFBVV95cUxOeTFaOFVQUDBnQlZtcWxqRFFLeVp1M2NENTM2TG9ZYzZnZTNEUEduYjQ5NVF1R3RxZ0ZobXBKbmZIdlJBWWVBdjY2WFBuZWpNRnpSNkVqOUtzN2pGMTJWWThiQ2VJWDBmWlZlcnVMOTJPdjg3WTZqbHpiRVJnUXNtU1g5dEsyM3JYeEp4NldJWWhxQWJMR05zUENNLWM0ZVR0R0tIaWFIdmlmZw</guid></item><item><title>运动营养师如何在没有超加工食品的情况下吃高蛋白饮食来促进锻炼并感到满意— Business Insider</title><link>https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-eats-high-protein-diet-without-ultra-processed-foods-2025-12</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story" data-track-marfeel="post-body-content"&gt;
            
                &lt;p&gt;Grocery store shelves are stacked with convenient, protein-ified snacks, from bars to soda. But how much should you rely on them if you're trying to avoid ultra-processed foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-cut-upfs-shares-3-lessons-after-year-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, a sports nutritionist, the answer is simple: it's "very, very easy" to consume &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-enough-protein-without-skimping-on-fiber-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;enough protein&lt;/a&gt; without relying on UPFs, which are linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease when eaten in large amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support his daily hourlong workout routine, which combines endurance training on an assault bike and weightlifting, he aims to consume around &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/protein-mistakes-health-issues-hit-your-goals-without-wasting-money-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;0.7g of protein&lt;/a&gt; per pound of body weight each day. Hobson said this is enough to build muscle, feel full, and fuel himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He used to turn to protein bars and shakes, which are typically ultra-processed, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ultra-processed-foods-impact-your-body-calories-weight-gain-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cut down on UPFs &lt;/a&gt;two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson shared how he hits his protein targets without eating UPFs, but stressed he is mindful of being overly restrictive. He does this by following the&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-follows-80-20-rule-diet-protein-fiber-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt; 80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;: eating whole, unprocessed foods most of the time, and whatever he's craving for the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still have a glass of wine. If I want a bit of chocolate, I will. If I want to have a pizza, I will," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson added that it's important not to obsess over single nutrients, such as protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you do that, then chances are you are missing out on other stuff," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f5b64409-1ca2-4daa-830e-f774a9a7db3e" data-toc-id="f5b64409-1ca2-4daa-830e-f774a9a7db3e"&gt;Eating oats with minimally processed protein powder for breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After he gets home from the gym, Hobson eats a bowl of overnight oats containing oats, milk, and a minimally processed protein powder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's whey protein that's been hydrolyzed, but it doesn't contain anything else," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats contain some protein, but they are high in soluble fiber, which helps lower cholesterol, and insoluble fiber, which supports smooth digestion and feeds the beneficial microbes in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="17a93eee-f410-41ab-b7a5-e4668d9819c3" data-toc-id="17a93eee-f410-41ab-b7a5-e4668d9819c3"&gt;Adding beans to soup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans are a cheap and convenient source of both protein and fiber. Just one cup of black beans, for example, contains around 15 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson adds them to his meals to up the protein count. "If I buy a ready-made soup, I will just chuck in half a can of beans," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="36a10c12-5c7d-40a4-ac56-1feb6a2a0293" data-toc-id="36a10c12-5c7d-40a4-ac56-1feb6a2a0293"&gt;Keeping the kitchen stocked with easy protein&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hobson always keeps his fridge stocked with protein sources, like canned tuna, tofu, and chicken, which he can quickly cook up and add to a stir-fry or stew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I find it really easy just to use those foods," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His go-to is a source of protein with some pre-cooked rice from a bag, vegetables, and soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of hypermobility, where business meetings in Berlin follow red-eyes from Boston and leisure travelers chase sunsets across hemispheres, &lt;strong&gt;jet lag remains a stubborn adversary&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite decades of research and a booming wellness industry promising quick fixes, the human body continues to resist the tyranny of time zone shifts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jet lag isn’t just a minor inconvenience—it’s a physiological &lt;strong&gt;tug-of-war&lt;/strong&gt; between your internal clock and the external world. The result? Days of &lt;strong&gt;fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/this-popular-yogurt-should-be-avoided-according-to-this-expert/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="70829" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;cognitive fog&lt;/strong&gt; that can derail even the most meticulously planned itinerary. And as global travel rebounds post-pandemic, the urgency to understand and mitigate jet lag has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes jet lag so insidious is its unpredictability. Two travelers on the same flight can experience vastly different symptoms. Age, chronotype, direction of travel, and even genetics play a role. Yet, the core conflict remains universal: our circadian rhythms, finely tuned to the &lt;strong&gt;24-hour cycle of light&lt;/strong&gt; and dark, don’t take kindly to abrupt changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a growing body of research is shedding new light on how to outsmart this biological inertia. From strategic light exposure to pre-flight sleep adjustments, scientists are uncovering practical, evidence-based strategies that could finally offer weary travelers a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Resetting the Clock: Light as the Master Regulator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The single most powerful tool in the jet lag arsenal? Light. Exposure to natural light is the primary cue that synchronizes our internal clocks with the external environment. Morning sunlight can help advance the circadian rhythm, making it easier to adjust to eastward travel, while evening light can delay it for westward shifts. The &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/jet-lag" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt; highlights light exposure as one of the most effective ways to reset your body clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apps like Timeshifter, developed with input from NASA scientists, use this principle to create personalized jet lag plans. They recommend when to seek or avoid light, &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/losing-attention-span-4-science-backed-habits-help-get-back/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="92798" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and sleep based on your itinerary and sleep patterns. While not a cure-all, these tools represent a leap forward from the days of blindly popping melatonin and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For travelers without access to such apps, the rule of thumb is simple: get outside. Even 20–30 minutes of natural light exposure in the morning can accelerate adaptation, especially when paired with light exercise like walking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sleep Strategically, Not Spontaneously&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most common mistakes travelers make is trying to “power through” jet lag by staying awake until local bedtime. The intention is right, but the execution often backfires. Sleep deprivation can intensify symptoms and make it harder to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend gradually shifting your &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/to-sleep-better-science-recommends-doing-this-1-2-hours-before-bed-and-its-surprisingly-simple/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="87863" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep schedule &lt;/a&gt;before departure. If you’re flying east, try going to bed and waking up an hour earlier each day for a few days before your flight. For westward travel, do the opposite. The &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/jet-lag" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; supports this approach as a proactive way to reduce jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Avoiding naps during the first day at your destination can also help, though short, strategic naps (20–30 minutes) may be beneficial if timed correctly. The key is consistency—your body needs clear signals to recalibrate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hydration, Caffeine, and the Myth of the Midnight Meal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Air travel is notoriously dehydrating, and dehydration can intensify jet lag symptoms. The Aerospace Medical Association recommends drinking at least eight ounces of water for every hour in the air. Alcohol and caffeine, while tempting, should be used sparingly. Caffeine can help with alertness but should be avoided within six hours of your intended bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging research suggests that meal timing may influence circadian rhythms. A study in Cell Reports found that mice who ate during their active phase adjusted more quickly to time zone changes. While human studies are ongoing, some experts suggest aligning meals with local time upon arrival to help reset the body’s internal clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Wearables to Chronomedicine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As interest in circadian health grows, so too does the technology designed to support it. Wearables like the &lt;strong&gt;Oura Ring &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;WHOOP strap&lt;/strong&gt; now track sleep stages and recovery metrics, offering insights into how travel affects the body. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are exploring chronobiotic drugs—compounds that can shift circadian rhythms more precisely than melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most promising frontier may lie in personalized medicine. Researchers are beginning to understand that circadian rhythms vary widely between individuals. Tailoring interventions to each person’s biological profile could redefine how we approach jet lag in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That future may still be on the horizon. For now, the best defense against jet lag remains a blend of science and strategy: plan ahead, seek the sun, hydrate well, and respect your body’s need for rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study out of the University of Illinois Chicago confirms what ER doctors have been noticing for a while: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS, for short, “&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-scromiting/"&gt;scromiting&lt;/a&gt;” for long) is very real, and getting more common. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, though, that we are nowhere near epidemic levels, as it remains quite rare and only affects cannabis power users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-35138887" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-35138887" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;CHS is an unpleasant side effect of a person’s plan to chill out with their favorite cannabis product of choice. After years of heavy cannabis use, a small but growing number of people will suddenly find themselves experiencing waves of nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting so violently that it’s accompanied by a terrifying scream, hence the nickname “Scromiting” — a screaming vomit.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Episodes can last up to two days. Hot showers seem to be the only reliable form of short-term relief, and a lot of them. The only reliable long-term fix anyone has stumbled upon so far is the most obvious one: stop using all forms of cannabis, immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-49887112" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-49887112" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Publishing their research in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841769" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers reviewed a national database of emergency department visits between 2016 and 2022, using cases that included both cannabis use and cyclical vomiting syndrome as a proxy for CHS, since it only recently became its own official diagnosis. They counted around 100,000 suspected cases in that period. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Rates were steady and low…and then 2020 hit, and suddenly CHS visits spiked across the country. Not sure what could’ve happened in 2020 that would’ve made everyone want to get out of their own heads for a couple of hours or maybe two straight years, but whatever it was, cases started dipping back down in 2022, though not quite back to the old levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-74778749" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-74778749" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The good news is that CHS is treatable once it’s recognized. Unfortunately, it’s often not recognized at all, and its symptoms can be easily misconstrued as something else entirely, leading to a battery of unnecessary tests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, that era is now over, as CHS is officially included in the International Classification of Diseases. Let’s just hope medical professionals brush up on all the latest diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-19-83569286" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-19-83569286" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It measures blood flow when the heart is pushed to work harder. But what it doesn’t show is what’s happening inside the artery walls, the place where most &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fortis-cardiologist-explains-why-heart-attacks-strokes-happen-early-morning-most-of-the-time-between-4-00-am-and-101763639230537.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; actually begin. “A stress test looks at traffic flow.

People don’t realise that their food choices can harm their metabolism. Think of your metabolism as an engine; it powers your body and controls how well you burn calories. When your metabolism works well, you feel energetic and strong. But some common foods can slow down metabolism quietly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/05/550x309/_3eee26e2-6336-11e8-a998-12ee0acfa260_1764930241698.jpg" alt="When a person includes at least 4 to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, it helps enhance digestion and increase metabolism, which leads to weight loss.

Sugary beverages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks like soft drinks, packaged juices, and energy drinks may seem refreshing. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Still, they contain a lot of refined sugars that can spike your blood sugar levels, often leading to energy crashes and making you feel tired and sleepy.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;"Drinking these high-sugar beverages regularly can also make it harder for your body to use insulin, slowing your metabolism", nutritionist Siddhi Kripal tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/artificial-sweeteners-and-their-effect-on-blood-sugar/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, liquid calories don't fill you up, so you might end up eating more later. Instead of reaching for a sugary drink, try water, herbal tea, or flavoured water to keep your energy steady without a sugar rush.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2. Refined grains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you enjoy the soft texture of white bread and the smooth feel of refined pasta? However, these refined grains do not provide the nutrients and fiber that your body needs. They digest too quickly, which can cause spikes in blood sugar and lead to tiredness and increased fat storage. Choosing whole grains can help keep your energy stable throughout the day and support a healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3. Instant or ready-to-eat foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to grab instant noodles, chips, or frozen meals. However, these processed foods often have high levels of sodium, unhealthy fats, and preservatives. “These ingredients can cause inflammation and make it harder for your body to burn fat,” says the expert. Cooking simple meals from scratch, even when you’re busy, can make a big difference. The nutritionist cited how a client, a dad with three kids, started preparing healthy meals on weekends. He found that he felt more energetic, and his whole family enjoyed the benefits of fresh, home-cooked food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4. Low-protein breakfasts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is a necessary time to start your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/10-yoga-asanas-to-boost-metabolism-and-burn-belly-fat-yoga-expert-shares-a-20-minute-morning-routine-for-beginners-101764777445993.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="metabolism"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. One common mistake people make is skipping protein in the morning. Without enough protein, your breakfast won't give you the energy you need for the day. "A sugary cereal or plain toast alone isn't enough. Instead, add eggs, Greek yoghurt, or a scoop of plant-based protein powder to your breakfast," says the nutrition expert. Eating protein regularly can help boost your metabolism by repairing muscles and increasing calorie burn throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5. Refined vegetable oils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you checked your pantry lately? Oils are important for cooking, but many common oils, such as palm, sunflower, and corn oil, contain high levels of omega-6 fatty acids. "Overeating of these can lead to inflammation, which can hurt your metabolism", says the expert. Instead, use heart-healthy oils like olive or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gallbladder-removal-diet-nutritionist-6-simple-food-swaps-diarrhea-bloating-fatty-liver-coconut-oil-instead-of-canola-101755143338007.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="coconut oil"&gt;coconut oil&lt;/a&gt;, which are better for you and can help your metabolism work well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;6. Caffeine overload&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee lovers enjoy caffeine for its ability to get them started in the morning; however, drinking too much caffeine can be harmful. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;"At the same time, a moderate amount can give your metabolism a short-term boost, too much caffeine increases cortisol levels, the stress hormone", says the nutritionist.&lt;/span&gt; This can lead to fat storage, especially around the belly. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It is important to keep your caffeine intake moderate and avoid drinking coffee late in the day, as it can disrupt sleep and affect a healthy metabolism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;7. Gluten from modern wheat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern wheat has changed and now contains 3 to 4 times more gluten than older varieties. This excess gluten can cause digestive problems, such as bloating, which may slow your metabolism. “If you often have stomach issues, consider replacing modern wheat with gluten-free options like quinoa, millets, or brown rice,” says Kripal. You may notice more energy after making this dietary change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;8. Low water intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is often overlooked in nutrition. Even mild dehydration can lower your metabolism by 2-3%. Water is essential for quenching thirst and for almost every metabolic process in the body. “Aim to drink 8-10 glasses of water each day,” shares Kripal. You can also include hydrating foods and drinks, such as coconut water, herbal teas, and homemade soups, to stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;9. Alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social drinks can make gatherings more enjoyable, but drinking alcohol, especially beer and sugary cocktails, can slow down your metabolism. When alcohol enters your body, your liver focuses on breaking it down, which temporarily stops fat from burning. "Alcohol also dehydrates you and affects the hormones that help regulate your metabolism", said the expert. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It is important to drink in moderation, try to have drinks less often, and look for non-alcoholic options to stay upbeat without hurting your metabolic health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;10. Low-fiber diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is important for your digestive health and helps your metabolism. Eating a low-fiber diet can make you feel tired and affect how well you digest food. “Try to include fiber-rich foods such as fruits, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/recipe/everyday-mix-vegetable-recipe-for-a-nutritious-plate-helping-you-increase-daily-veggie-intake-without-any-extra-effort-101764746253895.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vegetables"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, beans, and whole grains in your meals,” says the nutritionist. Feel lighter and more energetic after eating more fiber, which helps keep blood sugar levels steady and supports effective fat breakdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;11. Excess non-vegetarian consumption&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating protein is important for your metabolism, but eating too much non-vegetarian food, especially red or processed meats, can cause issues. “These foods often contain a lot of saturated fat and not enough fiber, which can slow digestion,” shares the expert. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To support better digestive health and a more efficient metabolism, try balancing your meals with plant-based foods, salads, and lean proteins like steamed fish or chicken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note to readers:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Pulling one knee in against the band trains the hip flexors eccentrically and concentrically without over-gripping,” says Castle about the lengthening and shortening of the muscle in this movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a superb exercise for runners, or anyone with tight hip flexors, as the band helps to highlight any imbalances you may have. If you lose tension in the band, that’s a muscular imbalance!”&lt;/p&gt;
