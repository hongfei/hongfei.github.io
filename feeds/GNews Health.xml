Scientists want those later decades to feel less like overtime and more like prime time, so they are probing ways to postpone the biological slide that usually accelerates after age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One avenue getting serious attention swaps crash diets for chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caloric-restriction-help-you-live-longer-its-complicated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cutting calories&lt;/a&gt; without malnutrition stretches the life of mice, worms, and even rhesus monkeys, but sticking to that routine is tough and can cause dizziness, brittle bones, and hair thinning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are hunting for pills that give the same benefits while letting dinner stay on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-importance-of-aging-research"&gt;Importance of aging research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging drives most top killers – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; – by pushing cells toward dysfunction. Delaying the underlying process could reduce the burden of several conditions at once instead of treating each separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health economists note that trimming even a few years off late-life disability would save billions in care costs and lift quality of life for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most drug discovery still targets single diseases, yet a growing field called geroscience treats aging itself as the root cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caloric-restriction mimetics, or CRMs, sit high on the wish list because they tap into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-slows-aging-by-boosting-cell-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic circuits&lt;/a&gt; that animals already use to survive lean times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those circuits turn on, cells tidy up damaged proteins, improve energy use, and bolster stress defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caloric-restriction-and-its-hurdles"&gt;Caloric restriction and its hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dietary-restriction-slows-brain-aging-and-increases-lifespan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt; usually means eating 20–40 percent fewer calories than normal for years on end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence in rodents is striking, but people find the regimen unsustainable, and severe energy cuts can weaken immunity. A safer strategy aims to flip the same molecular switches with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational screening tools now search drug libraries for compounds that make human cells mimic the gene-expression profile seen under calorie shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is faster than testing each molecule in live animals first and often highlights drugs already approved for other conditions, cutting years off the path to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rilmenidine-common-pill-fights-aging"&gt;Rilmenidine – common pill fights aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising hit from these searches is rilmenidine, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rilmenidine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension medicine&lt;/a&gt; taken by mouth for three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After machine-learning models flagged it, a team led by molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães at the &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Birmingham UK&lt;/a&gt; put it to the test in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, a small soil worm favored by aging researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same trial delivered another bonus: older worms benefited almost as much as young ones, hinting that humans would not need to start treatment in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s safety record also helps. Doctors prescribe rilmenidine worldwide for high blood pressure, and side effects are rare and relatively mild: they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Magalhães noted, “We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rilmenidine-acts-inside-cells"&gt;How rilmenidine acts inside cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine binds to imidazoline receptors, tiny docking stations on cell membranes that regulate metabolism. In worms, one receptor called &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Characterization-of-NISH-1_fig1_355334171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nish-1&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted,” the research team explained. They then re-introduced the receptor gene. Rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan after treatment with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings outline a clear pathway for future drug tweaks aimed at boosting potency or reducing any unwanted effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream from nish-1, the treated worms ramped up autophagy – the cell’s waste-disposal system – and tolerated heat stress better than untreated peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither developmental timing nor fertility shifted, suggesting the drug targeted aging pathways rather than growth or reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-across-species"&gt;Testing across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-junk-is-crucial-for-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shares many genes&lt;/a&gt; with humans, yet researchers need data from mammals before moving to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham group therefore fed rilmenidine to mice and saw gene-expression changes in liver and kidney tissue that matched the classic caloric-restriction signature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood biomarkers of metabolism shifted toward youthful levels, reinforcing the idea that the pill taps into ancient survival programs conserved across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the compound is already approved, early-phase human trials could focus directly on biological markers such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-loss-has-a-greater-impact-on-heart-health-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, insulin sensitivity, and muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine’s oral delivery is a practical advantage over drugs that require injections or special diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-rilmenidine-and-anti-aging"&gt;Future of rilmenidine and anti-aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer human studies must still rule out subtle harms and confirm that improved markers translate into healthier years. Even so, experts see momentum building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging – even if slightly – are immense,” Magalhães said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will need fresh guidelines for drugs that target aging rather than a diagnosed disease, and ethicists are debating fair access. Yet the prospect of taking a small daily tablet instead of counting every calorie is hard to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rilmenidine or similar compounds keep proving safe and effective, the next generation of seniors may find that staying healthy deep into their eighties feels less like luck and more like routine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 22:46:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQR1FveUFHRGozV2FrcTBKNURmRDRwdmlMMWpBaU1Ockw3VnNRWlBTS28xSnhlRkZVQTN3ZFUzZWNVOXFYT2QwTm1zOElqWndNNHN2RDI1NGlhYTZEVEowRXRuT3BkSkZkRXhJeFNsZi1FWFgxcjBIMVFrLU9jMFE0UkJDRk44WnBZQ0FhdG9UUEQ3R05IMHVNd1hkNTZiUXE1VnVURGpRNUt4Tm9PX3RoVUV3</guid></item><item><title>人们现在正在报告令人恐惧的COVID症状—以下是须知事项- Yahoo!

Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative col-body mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-[0.875rem]/[1.25rem] mt-1  line-clamp-2 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oleg Breslavtsev / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“If you are sick, it’s best to keep your germs to yourself,” said Horn. This means canceling the dinner plans, not going to the party and calling out of work if you can — if you can’t, wearing a tight-fitting mask is key, Horn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“Preventing transmission is the biggest thing that we can do to help keep everybody healthy,” Horn said.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/razor-sore-throat-painful-covid-symptom_l_6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/fabianabuontempo/things-women-do-that-make-men-feel-giddy?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;It's Nice To Feel Wanted&amp;quot;: Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"It's Nice To Feel Wanted": Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/modern-trends-that-should-disappear?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style&amp;quot;: People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style": People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelblatt/love-life-died-signs-medium-essay?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Was Devastated When The Love Of My Life Died.

Instead, it tweaked the recommendation for healthy children to say it was subject to “shared clinical decision-making” by the parent and doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="24"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;As before, parents could choose. And because it was on the schedule, insurance companies would pay and public health vaccine programs for lower-income kids would supply it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;When it comes to healthy pregnant women, they had always been included without being named, because pregnancy is one of the underlying health conditions that makes the vaccine important for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;That didn’t change, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="29"&gt;“Yes, providers are still carrying and offering this vaccine to their VFC-eligible patients,” said Georgia Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek, speaking of the Vaccines for Children government vaccine supply program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;Rick Ward, a spokesperson for the Georgia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;“It hasn’t been taken out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="33"&gt;The Georgia Office of the Commissioner of Insurance says they do not expect last month’s changes to affect private plans purchased on &lt;a href="https://georgiaaccess.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia Access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;Shake-up underway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="36"&gt;The public health landscape began shifting again Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="37"&gt;The scientists and doctors who draft the CDC immunization schedule, and who submit it to the CDC director, are called the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="38"&gt;Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, fired the entire membership of ACIP on Monday afternoon. He said he intends to replace them with members who have a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="39"&gt;“A clean sweep is necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy said in his statement. “ACIP new members will prioritize public health and evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="41"&gt;ACIP members make their decisions in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meetings and debates that anyone can view&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP’s members have tended to be scientists with long careers in research or medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="42"&gt;The American Medical Association, the nation’s organization of doctors, said in a statement that Kennedy’s move would have the opposite effect from building confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="44"&gt;“Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives,” the AMA statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="45"&gt;ACIP is currently scheduled to have its next meeting later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;How to choose a vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="47"&gt;In the mean time, parents and patients can always look at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/presentation-slides-june-26-28-2024.html" target="_blank"&gt;public research&lt;/a&gt; and debates provided in past ACIP meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="49"&gt;Never saying a vaccine is perfect, ACIP members typically weigh whether getting a vaccine is safer than not getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="50"&gt;They have made decisions both ways. For some patients, ACIP has decided that risks of side effects tip the scale against getting the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="51"&gt;For most pregnant women and their babies, the scale is on the side of getting the COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP decided. That’s because data suggests that not getting the vaccine could be more dangerous for both the fetus and the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="52"&gt;There’s a higher rate of premature babies associated with moms who have COVID-19. In the Delta pandemic wave, there was a higher rate of stillbirths for babies of women who had COVID-19. Fetuses and newborns under 6 months cannot get the COVID-19 vaccine themselves, so they depend on getting it through their mom when she’s pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="54"&gt;As for the mothers themselves, pregnancy puts women at risk of blood conditions like preeclampsia and blood clots. And COVID-19 is actually a vascular disease — capable of producing dangerous blood problems like microclots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="56"&gt;Pregnancy and COVID-19 together can be even more dangerous. Research shows pregnant women who get COVID-19 are more likely to wind up in the ICU or die than are other people who get the disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="57"&gt;After calculating how many people are protected from COVID-19 by getting the vaccine, the ACIP members calculated that in general it’s safer for them to get it than not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="58"&gt;As of Sept. 24, the CDC’s webpage for pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/pregnant-or-breastfeeding.html#:~:text=Everyone%20ages%206%20months%20and,pregnancy%20is%20safe%20and%20effective." target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, compared to those who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are at increased risk of complications that can affect your pregnancy and your baby from serious illness from COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="59"&gt;When it comes to healthy children, ACIP members have recently seemed to be easing back on their support, said Schaffner, the Vanderbilt professor, who previously served as medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. He wouldn’t have been surprised to see the recommendation for healthy kids scaled back by ACIP members who lost their jobs Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 20:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNdjlvM0d4TnRKQjhzWGR5aTUtWF9GZUhsRUNtLXJKd1M5c1lKZ1FqMXdMQXRycnVPc0ZQdGRUeUdMT3NVdzNMWTdENzh4bmUwcGpUbjhhR1A0dWU1VDducElIOVNwck9uQ1dXYXZVMHV3MnczUTFYN3k0WkFkNzh4TzNuWERZaEFTUUdtQUpiNFF4ZlRVUmpMbVM0T21KS3BtdEV3UWV3eml0ZjhKd0Rj</guid></item><item><title>年轻人喜爱的健康零食与突发中风、心脏病发作的风险惊人地联系在一起-每日邮报 | Health snacks loved by young people shockingly linked to risk of sudden strokes, heart attacks - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A popular sweetener used in protein bars and sugar-free energy drinks could raise your risk of suffering from a stroke, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-45314800-45ff-11f0-9fd1-db64ee3096b4"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, Boulder, exposed human cells found in the brain to erythritol in amounts they claimed mirrored a diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells showed worrying changes within hours, including a decrease in the amount of clot-busting proteins they released, which is key for preventing strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Auburn Berry, a graduate student who led the research, said: 'While erythritol is widely used in sugar-free products marketed as healthier alternatives, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a mystery rise in strokes in young people, which have surged almost 15 percent among under-45s since 2011 — according to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-42e1e9b0-4613-11f0-b50c-2fb299611993"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erythritol is a wildly popular sweetener, used in drinks including Vitaminwater Zero sugar, Monster Zero and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-9eafa0a0-460b-11f0-9fd1-db64ee3096b4"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; Iced Tea, and in Quest protein bars. It is also found in the sweetener truvia, which is often added to coffee as a sugar replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the new study was small and used isolated cells, it adds to the growing body of evidence raising concern about the sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11798339/Artificial-low-calorie-sweetener-raise-heart-attack-stroke-risk.html"&gt;A 2023 Cleveland Clinic study&lt;/a&gt; tracked 4,000 people found those who consume erythritol were more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some popular products with Erythritol include zero sugar Monster energy drinks, Vitaminwater Zero sugar and some Quest protein bars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study was published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers isolated human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells — cells that line blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After exposing them to erythritol for three hours in a lab, the researchers identified several damaging changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included the cells producing 75 percent more compounds that can damage them and surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they also produced about 20 percent less of a compound used to help blood vessels relax, allowing more blood to flow through and minimizing the risk of a clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also noted that erythritol decreased the production of a clot-busting protein called t-PA, which can dissolve clots and help prevent strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their conclusion, they said the sweetener 'potentially contributes to [an] increased risk of ischemic stroke'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain, preventing blood and oxygen from reaching brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause brain cells to die within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limitations of the study include that it was carried out in a lab outside the human body, which may not mirror internal conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, it was not clear how much of the sweetener is typically absorbed by these cells in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also exposed the cells to the equivalent of 30 grams of erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The sweetner erythritol has been linked to a higher risk of stroke. It is used in VitaminWater products shown above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is also used in Monster Zero products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers claimed this was 'equivalent to the typical amount... in an artificially sweetened beverage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the stated amount of sweetener in the beverages typically falls below this threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Monster Energy Zero contains about two grams of erythritol — according to consumer website &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/0070847015208/monster-energy-zero-ultra"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Vitaminwater says less than one percent of its 500 milliliter (ml) bottles contain erythritol, or less than five grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quest protein bars also contain up to five grams of erythritol each, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.questnutrition.com/products/chocolate-brownie-protein-bar"&gt;company's website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erythritol is about 70 percent as sweet as sugar but contains six percent of the calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be found in small amounts naturally in some foods, but in diet sodas is often made from processing corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also isn't easily processed by the body, meaning it is often passed out through urine.

'He comes to the autopsy table and I find he does have a horrible &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-b9be0880-4612-11f0-b206-f15fdeb071ef"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; - one of the worst pneumonias I've ever seen in my career - but as I went through the lung I realized the reason why there was pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was because there was a cancerous tumor, a small cell carcinoma of the lung that was encasing the airway,' he explained. 'So what happens is it grows into the airway and closes the airway off and causes a pneumonia behind that, it's called the post obstructive pneumonia secondary to malignancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2025, it is predicted that more than 600,000 people will die of cancer in the United States - but within that is a small number who don't even know they have it (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that pneumonia is not the cause of death, but the 'end point' of the actual underlying cause, which is cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without the cancerous tumor blocking the airway, you wouldn't have had the pneumonia,' Dr. Wolfe explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor then listed another example with a younger patient, who was a man in his early 20s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He had] had several months of abdominal pain, weight loss and fevers, also night sweats, and he refused to go to the doctor to investigate this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then the pain became so intense that he finally did go to the ER and they thought it was going to be some kind of appendicitis or ruptured organ,' the medical professional continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly, the young man didn't even make it to the CT scanner before he passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He wasn't able to be revived,' he somberly recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the man was taken to Dr. Wolfe to perform an autopsy, he found him riddled with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Wolfe, who has performed numerous autopsies to determine people's cause of death, recently posted a shocking TikTok sharing three stories from within the last few months (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I opened him up and found cancer in essentially every organ from his clavicles to his pelvis, also in the abdominal wall and the omentum [tissue that drapes over the intestines],' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor said it was a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma case, explaining: 'The tumor burden just gets so high it messes up the electrolytes for the patient and then they develop cardiac arrhythmia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last patient was a 65-year-old man who had colon cancer symptoms, but passed away before he could have a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I [did] the autopsy to determine the cause of death and it turns out he did actually have stage four colon cancer that was metastatic widely throughout his abdomen, and also into his lungs and had basically grown through the wall of the colon,' he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As per &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-can-you-have-cancer-without-knowing#takeaway"&gt;Healthline,&lt;/a&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After nearly two decades of unsuccessful attempts to start a family, a couple at Columbia University Fertility Center has become the first to get pregnant thanks to a groundbreaking AI system designed to find even the rarest sperm. The couple, identified as 38-year-old Rosie and her husband, had spent nearly 19 years trying to conceive and underwent 15 unsuccessful IVF attempts, reports &lt;a href="https://time.com/7291154/doctors-report-first-pregnancy-new-ai-procedure/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They finally found success with a new technology that offers hope to those facing male infertility caused by azoospermia—a condition where no sperm is detectable in semen.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The AI tool, called STAR (Sperm Track and Recovery), uses an algorithm paired with a fluidic chip that screens samples, searching for rare sperm cells invisible to even experienced embryologists. The approach, developed by Dr. Zev Williams and his team, &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/columbia-fertility-looks-stars-help-men-infertility"&gt;borrows from astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, where AI scans for new stars among billions in the sky; here, it scans millions of cells for scarce sperm. Once found, the sperm can be preserved or used in fertilization. Prior to STAR, men with azoospermia had few options besides using donor sperm or trying invasive and sometimes risky procedures. For Rosie and her husband, STAR found sperm in samples where manual searches found none.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "The embryologists really worked hard to find sperm, since they didn't want to be outshone by a machine," Williams tells &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;. "In one of the samples they analyzed for two days and found no sperm, STAR found 44 in an hour." Rosie's successful pregnancy in March 2025 did not require any extra IVF testing or steps. Sperm collected with STAR was used immediately to fertilize Rosie's eggs. Now four months along, Rosie reports the experience still feels unreal after years of disappointment. Dr. Williams sees broader potential for AI in tackling other infertility challenges, noting that it may reveal biological details previously missed.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

And we’re not the only ones that are concerned about the internet’s infatuation for “cure-all health hacks.”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On an episode of the &lt;em&gt;CAPS LOCK&lt;/em&gt; podcast, guest dietitian Vanessa Rissetto M.S., RD, CDN took the stage to debunk today’s biggest nutrition myths.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what she notes to be the top four health red flags you should be wary of.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ah yes, the carnivore diet, AKA the theory that exclusively eating meat will help aid weight loss and muscle growth. If this sounds unrealistic, don’t worry: This dietitian has had enough of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt; in your diet is important, there’s a variety of protein sources that provide more nutritional value than red meat, like fatty fish, beans and legumes, tofu and nuts. And the dietitian does make a point that eating too much red meat is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk factor for colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Recent research shows a link between mutations in colon tumors and a diet that includes regular red and processed meat intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, any food is OK in moderation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994363/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-red-meat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; can provide a great source of vitamin B12 and iron, but anything in excess usually isn’t great for the body. Since this diet does not include fruits, vegetables and grains, there's a risk for nutrition deficiencies, constipation and more health concerns. A balanced eating pattern is the best kind!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Are they really the inflammatory monsters you need to be avoiding?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s cut to the chase. Nightshades are not the problem—unless you have an intolerance to them. As Rissetto rightfully asks, “What did the tomato ever do to you?” There’s plenty of research that connects these specific vegetables to anti-inflammatory properties, especially due to their phytochemicals and other essential nutrients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s clear that protein has had a major spotlight through trending recipes, viral fast food favorites and celebrity products. But what if we told you that you’re likely already eating enough protein in your day-to-day life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You don’t need to eat your bodyweight [in protein],” Rissetto clarifies. Use our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/#toc-how-much-protein-do-you-need-each-day" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine exactly how much protein you need, and you will see that it's only a fraction of your weight. Your body is only able to absorb so much protein, so &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291875/6-signs-you-could-be-eating-too-much-protein/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating too much&lt;/a&gt; may not lead to more benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein will keep you satisfied and can help with strength and mobility, but it isn’t the only nutrient you should focus on. Foods packed with fiber and antioxidants like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; have a slew of benefits, from gut health to skin health, and they shouldn’t be overlooked because they’re lower in protein.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7867963/electrolyte-drinks-what-are-they-and-do-you-need-them/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/a&gt; can help deter you from dehydration after a strenuous workout, a day in the summer heat or if you’re under the weather. But you don’t need to “replenish electrolytes” every day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When you go to a 45-minute spin class, you don’t need to replenish anything,” Rissetto explains. “Just drink water.” Of course for special circumstances like running a marathon, having electrolytes is important. In general, water is hydrating enough for your typical day. And many electrolyte drinks on the market have a lot of added sugar, so they’re not ideal for a go-to beverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy eating pattern&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating movement into your routine doesn’t have to be complicated, and it definitely doesn’t need to abide by the latest internet trends. At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we hold the firm philosophy that a balanced, non-restrictive diet is best, and paying attention to both your body’s wants and needs is key. If you’re unsure of what diet or exercise plan makes sense for you, talk to a healthcare professional or dietitian for personalized advice.

"The most games that were included were console games, computer games and mobile games."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When asked if violent games, such games that involved shooting, led to more behavioral issues, Noetel said that was not necessarily the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Some studies broke the games down by whether they were violent, but our interpretation was that most parents knew to limit the amount of violent content to give kids under 10," he said. "Instead, [the] key finding was that gaming in general -- regardless of the specific type -- showed much stronger links to emotional problems than other screen activities like watching TV or using educational apps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Stock photo of a teen girl on her cellphone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Crispin La Valiente/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study is one of the largest of its kind, analyzing 117 long-term studies conducted between 1972 and 2024.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0q500173b77dintz8b9@published"&gt;I’m a black woman of color in my late 20s, have been single for about six years, am pansexual, and would like to spend the next year or two in my slut era. I’ve wanted to have this era for the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0se00183b77cskdcev8@published"&gt;I’d like to say that COVID is the main reason why I haven’t had it, but if I’m being honest, it’s because I don’t know where to start. My penetrative sexual experience is pretty limited—I’ve done it twice with two different partners and mostly felt awkward in both encounters—and have very little experience with women/nonbinary people, but would love to explore that. I’m not quite demisexual but need to get coffee or something before I can contemplate sex, and I am not one for one-night stands. I’d rather get coffee than drinks, as I’m not really a nightlife person. I’m awake around 5:30 a.m. without an alarm, so I’d rather be asleep by 9:30 p.m. than up until 2 a.m. at the club. I also have some sensory sensitivities (I’m level 1 autistic) related to bodily fluids (primarily sweat) that don’t bother me unless I’m stuck in my head, which I’m very prone to.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0tz00193b77luqhq2x8@published"&gt;On top of this, my body has changed over the last few years in ways that I’m not the most comfortable with. I’ve primarily experienced weight loss, but I’ve always had some level of body dysmorphia, and it comes with a lot of stretch marks. I do groom regularly, but I’m still a bit hairy down there and don’t want to make partners floss, so to speak. At the same time, though, I know I’m attractive to others. So, how do I kick things off and find my (ideally several) people? And how do I get out of my head enough in the moment to actually enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0w2001a3b77d6ovyxha@published"&gt;—Sensitive But Aspiring Slut&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0xs001b3b77nbllh3po@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Sensitive,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0z2001c3b77kd2bv6cf@published"&gt;One useful place to start is considering why you want to have this period of multiple sexual connections, and what degree of emotional and intellectual intimacy you’re both hoping for and willing to engage in. Ask yourself what you’re hoping to get out of this stage of your life—yes, an increase in experience, but for what purpose? Do you want to make friends while you’re giving each other orgasms? Are you open to forming romantic relationships if the potential is there, and would you want to keep those relationships open, or would you want to segue into monogamy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="215" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb11a001d3b77lzgqkb4r@published"&gt;Meanwhile, Gen Xers and even Millennials—the generations popularly associated with hook-up culture (and expansive access to porn on the internet as chronicled in Sophie Gilbert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/porn-american-pop-culture-feminism/682114/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl on Girl: How Pop Culture Turned a Generation of Women Against Themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)—usually do, and generally always have, preferred a smidge of getting to know each other before going past groping. Think, the taxi ride or walk home from a club, a coffee in a public space when connecting from an app, and even, during the pandemic, a tendency to engage in a video call before meeting up. People anonymously having sex in nightclub bathrooms or going directly to each other’s apartments without exchanging face pictures are, and historically have been, outliers in the grand scheme of sex-having Americans. So, if the demisexual identity fits you in other ways, please do use it, but know that there’s nothing atypical about wanting to know the person you’re about to have sex with to some degree. Another detail that is completely typical is pubic hair. Sure, you may run into someone who—despite much of porn being full of pubes—has strange ideas about hairlessness being the norm, and they may be a jerk about it. Most likely, though, anyone with experience will know how to gently brush any hair out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb12r001e3b77w6pxnren@published"&gt;As for getting out of your head and being in the present moment, mindfulness is your best move here. I know it isn’t simple, and you may be thinking it sounds boring (if that’s the case, keep trying different forms until you find one that is engaging). Some autistic adults report that traditional mindfulness practices don’t work as well for them as for neurotypical people, so &lt;a href="https://thinkingautismguide.com/2024/08/mindfulness.html"&gt;here’s a quick list of additional ideas&lt;/a&gt;. The point here is to build your capacity to focus your mind on where you are right now and what you’re feeling in the moment. Find something that works for you and practice it every single day. Eventually, you’ll see results.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb148001f3b77tlo4aalp@published"&gt;You’ve got a couple of likely options when it comes to navigating your relationship with your body. You can highlight the parts you’d like to have appreciated, and combine that with engaging your mindfulness skills when someone comments on a part you’d rather ignore. You can also go for the “fake it till you make it” approach and highlight the aspects of your body that people comment positively on most. Know that—while much like with pubic hair, you may occasionally encounter a judgmental jerk—most of the time people are focused on appreciating the person in front of them, and far less likely to notice, much less be turned off by or comment negatively about, the areas you zero in on critically when you look in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

Apps are always an option (depending on where you live, you’ll have several available to you, and you’ll need to decide which of the bountiful array you’re most interested in trying). You might also consider asking friends whether they know anyone you might match nicely with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb5nr001r3b77mizegxry@published"&gt;I’m 25 now. I’ve been told I’m charming, handsome, in shape, and successful. I’m also perpetually single. All my past relationships have started out excellent, only to fall apart six months to a year in. I’ve asked what the problem is every time, and I always got the BS “It’s not you, it’s me. We’re just not compatible” kind of answers. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/07/relationships-one-year-end-sex-advice.html"&gt;Until an ex who I had a falling out with finally told me what the real problem was.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqoeyoi004n3b76j2r1sxah@published"&gt;One of the regulars, “Annie,” arrived with “Clay,” whom she met at the sex club we all frequent, and said he had brought a “big surprise.” That was an understatement. Clay was packing a nine-inch penis. Suffice it to say, all the women made sure he was properly “welcomed” into our social circle. Ever since then, I have been incredibly depressed. I can’t imagine how I’m ever going to satisfy my wife again. I’m not small, I would say I’m average, but how can I possibly compete with something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi1t001f3b76lfp5ux0u@published"&gt;Do you believe your wife when she tells you things? I ask because an alarming number of men don’t believe women when they express their preferences, especially when those preferences are at odds with men’s own ideals or ideas about what women want. The &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/dad-bod-body-image-trends-olly-murs-b1224933.html"&gt;recent controversy surrounding William Costello’s poll about Olly Murs’ shifting body&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2025/05/02/why-men-get-furious-at-women-who-say-they-prefer-the-dad-bod/"&gt;the many men who then accused female poll respondents of lying&lt;/a&gt;, are stark examples of the way that straight men can struggle with squaring their own expectations and the realities of women’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi41001g3b76k4oxkuhu@published"&gt;If you don’t generally believe your wife, you’ve got a whole other, larger issue. But if you do, share your insecurities with her. Keep in mind that whole infants often pass through people’s vaginal canals, and after birth, those people are still able to enjoy penetrative sex. Remember that bigger—especially longer—often means battering of the cervix, which can make a large penis less attractive in the context of a committed relationship than in the context of a one-off at a sex party. And there’s so much more to sex than the in-and-out of it, at least as far as what women generally find enjoyable. With those facts in your mind as a baseline, listen to what your wife has to say in response to how you’re feeling. Internalize the reassurance she is likely to offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

You are, I’m certain, far more than a life support system for a fleshy, self-driving dildo. If you’re still struggling after taking all of these steps, therapy may be in order. Depression is serious, and if you’re experiencing enough symptoms of it to describe yourself as “incredibly depressed” in response to this one incident, it’s quite possible that there are more factors at play that a professional will be well-positioned to help you address.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnxhdy001q3b76mbtpcafq@published"&gt;My girlfriend “Anabel” has been having a problem for a couple of months now. Sometimes when we are having sex, it will feel like she’s about to orgasm and then her pussy will suddenly squeeze my dick so hard it’s painful. I lose my erection and have to wait in near-agony until she unclenches to get out. This has only happened a handful of times, but it’s VERY unpleasant when it does. Anabel is not at all happy about this, but says she doesn’t know how to distinguish between whether she is going to come or clamp up. It’s beginning to affect our love life because, as you can imagine, I am more than a little reluctant to take the risk. What can be done about this?&lt;/p&gt;

Absolutely do not, under any circumstances, encourage Anabel to search up various exercises and try them without professional guidance. It can do more harm than good. Keep in mind that the choice to see a medical professional is Anabel’s at the end of the day, but if she’s open to the idea, you can help by searching for local providers.&lt;/p&gt;

I have had an erratic work schedule for the past five months, and because of this, he claims he has to resort to self-pleasure since I’m never around when he wants sex. There have been plenty of times when I’ve tried to initiate, but he turns me down because (surprise!) it’s been less than an hour since he smacked it. At this point, I’m beginning to wonder if he even truly needs me at all—I can count the number of times we’ve had sex in the last couple of months on one hand without using all my fingers. Should I try and repair the connection that we used to have, or is he sending me a not-so-subtle message that our time together is over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, part of the German National Cohort (NAKO) population study, imply that programs to encourage physical activity and prevent infections in childhood may help lower the risk of developing MS later in life, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/multiple-sklerose-familienvorgeschichte-lebensstil-und-gesundheitliche-faktoren-im-kindes-und-jugendalter-c8a5d38e-ed72-40fa-8b38-2bd2a23944a8"&gt;The relation of multiple sclerosis to family history, lifestyle, and health factors in childhood and adolescence: Findings of a case–control study nested within the German National Cohort (NAKO) Study,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” was published in &lt;em&gt;Deutsches Arzteblatt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The causes of MS are still mostly unknown,” study co-author Heiko Becher, PhD, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany, said in a &lt;a href="https://nako.de/en/press-releases/ms-research-focusses-on-the-early-years-of-life/"&gt;NAKO news story&lt;/a&gt;. “Some studies suggest that environmental and lifestyle factors can induce the development of disease in genetically predisposed people. Known risk factors include a genetic predisposition, an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, a vitamin D deficiency, smoking and obesity. Influences from childhood and adolescence have so far been less well studied.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is an inflammatory disorder that typically develops during adulthood, but an emerging body of research suggests that certain exposures during childhood may be &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for the disease. For example, childhood infection with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; (EBV) is a well-established MS risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Comparing childhood exposures to predict MS risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared childhood exposures in a group of 576 people with MS and 895 people without MS who were matched by sex and age. Using statistical models, the researchers looked for childhood factors that were significantly more common in the MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results identified several well-established risk factors, such as EBV infection and obesity, but some other notable factors turned up as well. Data indicated that childhood infections increased the risk for MS by 14% per event, and stressful life events increased the risk by 25% per event. People born to a mother aged 30 or older were more than twice as likely to develop MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, more physical activity during childhood and adolescence was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could have implications for clinical care, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results underline the relevance of existing preventive measures in the context of other non-communicable diseases – for example to prevent childhood infectious diseases, to encourage healthy eating habits or to motivate people to be active,” said Anja Holz, study co-author and a research fellow at University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf. “These could also be promising strategies in MS prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a “particularly impressive example” of such a strategy, Holz said. “Current studies show that exercise in adulthood can act as a protective factor against MS. Targeted physical activity programs in adolescence might also potentially help to lower the risk of MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

                A vaccine pharmacist prepares samples as part of an HIV vaccine trial on March 16, 2022 in Masaka, Uganda. The vaccine in that trial did not prove effective. A promising vaccine development program funded by the National Institutes of Health was just informed by the Trump administration that its support will end next year.

   &lt;p&gt;For nearly 15 years, Dennis Burton worked on a project aimed at solving what he calls "one of the most difficult problems in biomedicine" — creating an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That work was funded by the largest National Institutes of Health-funded program devoted to such research, with a seven-year grant totaling $258 million, and is considered one of the leading vaccine efforts. On May 30, he learned that work will end. In a video call, NIH officials told him that the Trump administration was terminating the program next year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just devastating. So much human toil has gone into this," says the Scripps Research Institute immunologist. "Just when it looked like we could beat this virus, we're going to give up."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Designing an effective HIV vaccine has proven &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/04/26/179231916/failure-of-latest-hiv-vaccine-test-a-huge-disappointment" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immensely challenging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for researchers, who've spent decades working to figure out how to prompt the immune system to protect against this wily virus, says &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/burton/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Burton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons it's so difficult is because the HIV virus evolves faster than any other known virus. Even within an infected individual, the virus can splinter off into many new variants, effectively dodging the immune system's first-responders — antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Burton and his colleagues at the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/chavi-id" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a consortia of researchers at Scripps and Duke University known as CHAVD — have been working on a promising approach aimed at coaxing the immune system to make "broadly neutralizing antibodies" capable of attacking many forms of the virus. Clinical trials were slated to start as soon as next year. Without funding, they won't proceed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts that dilute taxpayer resources," a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson told NPR in response to a question about the rationale behind the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news of the termination comes as the HIV vaccine has largely coalesced around the idea that broadly neutralizing antibodies are central to an effective HIV vaccine, says &lt;a href="https://www.iavi.org/person/mark-feinberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Feinberg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of IAVI, a non-profit that develops vaccines. Scripps and Duke researchers were pursuing different approaches toward that shared goal, which is good, he says. "You don't know which is going to work and whether there's potential synergies between the two approaches."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's termination of CHAVD is just the latest in a string of cuts and cancellations of HIV-vaccine related grants, from clinical trials to basic laboratory research. In 2022, the U.S. accounted for &lt;a href="https://avac.org/resource/infographic/top-vaccines-funders/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly 90%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the $731 million devoted to HIV vaccine research globally. If those funds dry up, many researchers fear that the prospects of getting an effective HIV vaccine will dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After many years of frustration and negative results we now believe that there is a pathway to develop an efficacious HIV vaccine," says Feinberg. "It's really disappointing at this time to have the foundation kicked out from underneath you."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A canceled African trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The NIH-funded project isn't the only vaccine research being affected by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late January, biomedical scientist &lt;a href="https://idm.uct.ac.za/contacts/linda-gail-bekker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Linda-Gail Bekker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and her colleagues were gathered in Tanzania to discuss their efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines across eight African countries. That team, called &lt;a href="https://africanalliance.org.za/brilliant-consortium-shut-down-home-page/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The BRILLIANT HIV vaccine consortium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had won a five-year $45 million dollar grant from USAID in 2023 and was days away from starting its first clinical trial in humans when it got a stop-work order from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To say we were disappointed is to completely underplay how we felt," said Bekker, of the University of Cape Town. "We felt desperate, that something we'd been working so hard to accomplish was removed without a good reason."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bekker and her colleagues had spent a year assembling a team of research biologists and clinicians from around the world to develop immunogens — substances that kick start an immune response that serve as the basis for future vaccines. They looked for inspiration, in part, from HIV patients in South Africa whose bodies seem to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/12/12/786811843/a-new-hiv-vaccine-effort-with-a-different-kind-of-strategy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naturally produce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The idea was to base [vaccines] on [HIV] viruses that had been discovered in Africa and immunogens designed based on those viruses as templates," she said. Underscoring the global nature of HIV vaccine research, scientists with the CHAVD program helped design some of the immunogens, Bekker says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then, the team would "put these immunogens into humans, in clinical trials, to test whether we can actually move the human immune system to make broadly neutralizing antibodies," says Bekker. Those clinical trials were slated to happen in African countries where the HIV epidemic is most severe, allowing researchers to more clearly assess whether the vaccines work than if they were to test them in, say, the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Bekker and her colleagues have largely stopped vaccine-related work and are instead scrambling to find alternative funds for the project.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The USAID grant is "irreplaceable" in terms of its scope, says Bekker. The team is now figuring out how to scale back their ambitions by running fewer, smaller clinical trials. But that means the data will be less valuable, says Bekker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These kinds of international collaborations are commonplace in efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines, researchers told NPR — and face an uncertain future under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May, NIH announced it would &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-104.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no longer fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; foreign "subawards," which allow U.S. scientists to pay foreign collaborators to conduct research overseas. Last year, NIH funded more than 3,600 such awards. Instead, foreign researchers must apply directly to NIH for funding, a barrier that will likely reduce foreign collaboration, says &lt;a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/zolla-paznerlab/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Susan Zolla-Pazner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Foreign partners in HIV research are extremely important," she says. "It's a global disease and viruses don't recognize national boundaries." For example, if a researcher wanted to study how to prevent babies from being infected by their HIV-positive mothers, the best thing to do is conduct the study in a place where such mothers exist in sufficient numbers, which is outside of the U.S. says Zolla-Pazner. If you can't do that, "it's more than a hurdle. It's a brick wall in terms of being able to understand how to protect a population of women and their children."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On top of these restrictions, researchers worry generally about the prospect of getting vaccine-related grants accepted in the current climate. NIH has already cancelled or delayed payments on over 2,500 individual grants, including some related to HIV vaccine research, and under the Trump administration has&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; signaled a shift away&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from mRNA vaccine research — the same platform that allowed rapid development of the first COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pessimism — and yet hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Altogether, the administration's actions — and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pledges to cut funding&lt;/a&gt; for NIH grants by more than 40% next year — have many researchers pessimistic about the prospects of developing an HIV vaccine anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My personal view is that advances will stall out," says Burton, the Scripps scientist. "The United States led the world in HIV vaccine research, I don't think that anyone's going to step into the breach," he says. "Philanthropy can certainly help, but they're unlikely to step in with the magnitude of funding needed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if funding eventually comes back, from the U.S. or elsewhere, it can be difficult for research groups to bounce back from extended cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is putting a period in the middle of a sentence," says Zolla-Pazner. "You cannot reconstitute that group, even two months later, because people have lost their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other researchers are hopeful the field will eventually build on the progress already made to deliver an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It remains a huge challenge, but we now have little chinks of light of how to move this field forward," says Bekker. "I believe we will get back on track, but we will have lost time," she says. "And that means people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes at federal science agencies and their effects on research?

While you can consume collagen through &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7905460/the-best-collagen-powders-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, your body makes collagen on its own and requires vitamin C to do so.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is one of the reasons why vitamin C is often linked to hair, skin and nail health. “A deficiency of this vitamin can often be identified in your skin and in the unhealthy gums in your mouth,” says Salge Blake.

In addition to its antioxidant effects, vitamin C is required for various functions within immune cells, and its role in skin health provides an important barrier against harmful pathogens.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, it’s important to note that research is ongoing to understand the benefits of vitamin C intake—especially above the recommended DV—and protection against infection and other diseases.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-eye-health-according-to-a-dietitian-8773671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eye health&lt;/a&gt; can decline thanks in part to oxidative stress. Vitamins A, C and E have all been linked with helping to prevent or delay the onset of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, thanks to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Before you reach for a bottle of vitamin C, it’s worth noting that one review suggests that, when paired with an overall healthy diet, consuming vitamin C rich foods may be more beneficial than supplements for slowing the progression of age related cataracts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With the majority of the immune system housed in the gut, it may not come as a surprise that there’s ongoing research on the impact of vitamin C on gut health. Small studies suggest that vitamin C may help promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and strengthen the gut lining by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, while promising, larger studies are needed to better understand the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-and-gut-health-8558337" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C on gut health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-broccoli-is-a-nutrient-superstar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Broccoli is a Nutrient Superstar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s more to this tree-shaped green veggie than just vitamin C. “Broccoli doesn’t just come with vitamin C, it also provides a slew of nutrients that help your body absorb and use it more effectively. You’re not just getting a dose of vitamin C, you’re getting a whole system of support,” says Hemler. Here are some of these benefits: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a Good Source of Dietary Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;One ½-cup serving of cooked broccoli provides 3 grams of filling fiber.1 &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; not only keeps you fuller for longer, but is also important for gut, heart and metabolic health. Most Americans are falling short of meeting the recommended 25–38 grams of fiber per day, making broccoli a helpful food for closing the gap in your daily fiber intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Provides a Boost of Potassium: &lt;/strong&gt;According to Salge Blake, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; is another nutrient of concern that most Americans aren’t getting enough of.8 Potassium is crucial for fluid balance within cells and plays an important role in heart health and blood pressure management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One ½-cup serving of cooked broccoli provides 229 mg of potassium, or about 5% of the DV.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s an Excellent Source of Folate and Vitamin K:&lt;/strong&gt; One ½-cup serving of cooked broccoli boasts an impressive 21% of the DV for folate and 91% of the DV for vitamin K. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937128/foods-with-more-folate-than-kale/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Folate&lt;/a&gt; is essential for healthy cell function and particularly important for people who are or may become pregnant. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7914418/what-is-vitamin-k/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; is known for its role in blood clotting and may also support bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Supports Iron Absorption: &lt;/strong&gt;Another benefit of vitamin C is that it helps with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-iron-supplement-8637263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;iron absorption&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from plant-based sources. Thanks to its vitamin C content, pairing broccoli with a plant-based source of iron, like beans or soy, may help support healthy iron levels in the blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is a versatile and (generally) inexpensive vegetable that can be found in almost every grocery store—either in the produce section and/or the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290575/fresh-vs-frozen-vegetables-are-we-giving-up-nutrition-for-convenience/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;frozen food&lt;/a&gt; aisle. Here are some easy ways to prepare it: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roast or Grill It: &lt;/strong&gt;For an easy side, toss broccoli with oil and seasonings and roast it in the oven or throw it &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277835/grilled-broccoli-with-smoky-yogurt-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;on the grill&lt;/a&gt;. Salge Blake says the latter is her favorite method, noting that grilled broccoli works beautifully as an addition to grain bowls, salads and pasta dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam It:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple yet classic, steaming broccoli is a quick and nutritious pairing for a heartier protein, like salmon, chicken breast or a veggie burger. Pro tip: don’t skimp on the seasonings! A light squeeze of lemon, dash of dried herbs and grate of fresh garlic can go a long way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice It: &lt;/strong&gt;While you may have heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cauliflower-rice-recipe-8401635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cauliflower rice&lt;/a&gt;, riced broccoli is a lesser-known option that’s become a staple in my family’s meals. Try adding it to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-casserole-recipes-to-make-forever-8404203" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;casserole&lt;/a&gt;, quiche or rice bowl for an easy nutrient boost. While relatively easy to rice yourself using a food processor, you can also look for riced broccoli in the frozen foods section at your local supermarket for added convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chop or Shred It: &lt;/strong&gt;Helmer’s favorite way to enjoy broccoli is raw, chopped or shredded, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8017785/creamy-broccoli-slaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;slaw&lt;/a&gt; with a tangy vinegar-based dressing. “It makes a super crunchy, fresh summer side dish,” he says. Shredded broccoli also works well in salads, tacos, sandwiches and wraps for an easy lunch or dinner. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puree It:&lt;/strong&gt; From broccoli cheese soup (perfect for soup weather days) to dips and sauces, purred broccoli is another easy way to add a boost of veggies that even picky eaters will enjoy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the best veggies&lt;/a&gt; for boosting your vitamin C intake. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient with numerous functions, including supporting a strong immune system. Besides providing more than 50% of your daily vitamin C needs, broccoli is packed with other essential nutrients, including fiber, potassium, folate, vitamin K and antioxidants. “Essentially, broccoli is like the Swiss Army knife of veggies—small, but loaded with tools your body loves!” says Hemler.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit? Broccoli is incredibly versatile and can be found in virtually any grocery store—including the frozen section of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/6-best-anti-inflammatory-foods-at-dollar-tree-8777894" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;some dollar stores&lt;/a&gt;.

During roughly an eight-year period, 90.3 percent of exercisers survived compared with 83.2 percent of those who were in a general health education program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWM5VBIQKBB23JE7XSGXZ6PZJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We asked experts what people should know about this new research and how people who’ve had cancer — especially those who might still be experiencing fatigue, nausea and other side effects from treatment — can reap the potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QIQYNUKUQVAGBLQKEW3K7GUA3Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QIQYNUKUQVAGBLQKEW3K7GUA3Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How much exercise is beneficial?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5B2RCM4VWNHT7MYMEGUPXI4SS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new study, researchers didn’t just tell patients to exercise. People with Stage 2 or Stage 3 colon cancer (who had already completed surgery and chemotherapy two to six months earlier, and also passed a treadmill test) were given a structured exercise program that pushed them to reach certain exertion targets, almost as if they were in physical therapy. That made a difference, noted &lt;a href="https://radonc.utoronto.ca/faculty/rebecca-wong" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Wong&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the radiation oncology department at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the study, because it provided motivation and goals that enabled people to stick with exercise over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YHS7N3DOPNGL7DMFP3MP3EHDJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In all, 445 people were put on the structured exercise program for three years and another 444 patients were simply advised that exercise would help their prognosis. In the structured program, people hit their targets mainly by brisk walking, which is considered moderate intensity activity, though some were able to do higher-intensity activities such as jogging, swimming, biking, playing pickleball or tennis. But the benefit isn’t just from having a structured regimen, Wong said. It’s having one you stick with for the long haul. “It’s a lifestyle change,” Wong said. “It’s not so much, do this for three years and you can go back and sit on the couch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NSBREXYCJRFS7OHTSHEXDMSEZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the reduced risk was not just for colon cancer. Patients in the structured exercise group also were less likely to develop new primary cancers, indicating there is potentially a protective effect for other cancers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4KJTPNIK3RHTFCY57YUJDEN5XI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4KJTPNIK3RHTFCY57YUJDEN5XI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How should cancer patients exercise?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PUVGEZLYSVEHZHZZAVKWM5GIK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For cancer survivors, the&lt;a href="https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EIM_Rx-for-Health_Cancer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; American College of Sports Medicine recommends&lt;/a&gt; starting slowly and building up to at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week, either moderate-intensity activity such as walking, light cycling, yoga, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/how-to-start-tai-chi/" target="_blank"&gt;tai chi&lt;/a&gt; or water exercise, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous activity such as brisk walking, singles tennis or hiking hills — or a combination of both. They also recommend some strength and resistance exercises such as weight training two to three times per week, suggesting 6 to 15 reps using weights, resistance bands, weight machines or your own body, doing things such as kitchen counter &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/10/no-more-girl-push-ups/" target="_blank"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt; or chair squats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FMKRD5R7RBQ5NZBFDHO5YA6IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, if you have cancer or have recently completed treatment, the last thing you might want to hear is that you need to work out. Given how physically arduous cancer treatment can be, it’s important to note that the new study was conducted in patients who had completed active treatment for their colon cancer, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.med.ubc.ca/sharlene-gill/" target="_blank"&gt;Sharlene Gill&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QJ5EYSBD6VDYJGUDX6CEFJKVRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings “can’t be extrapolated to those patients who are on active treatment and are managing symptoms and side effects, but we believe there would be a quality of life benefit,” Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UUGY4HCLGVHQXGYKCYQGPKFGVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those people, exercise needs to be matched with capacity.

&lt;p&gt;While it’s still early to understand if these findings can apply to patients, exploring brain circuits beyond the basal ganglia — a region involved in motor control and affected by Parkinson’s — may lead to new treatments that ease the disease’s motor symptoms, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even if the path toward new therapeutic approaches to alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease still appears long, such foundational research is immensely important,” Wolfgang Kruse, PhD, a researcher at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2025-05-27-optogenetics-how-brain-stimulation-alleviates-symptoms-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-96995-4"&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of inferior colliculus neurons elicits mesencephalic locomotor region activity and reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; as a collaborative effort from researchers at Ruhr and Philipps-Universität Marburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sound processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s, the loss of dopaminergic neurons — the nerve cells in the brain that produce the signaling molecule dopamine— stops input into the basal ganglia. As a result, patients experience a range of motor symptoms, from tremor and slowed movement to stiffness and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced disease, or those who no longer respond to medication, may benefit from &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/surgical-treatments/"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (DBS), in which small electrodes are placed deep in the brain — usually in parts of the basal ganglia. These electrodes are connected by thin wires to a device that delivers electrical pulses to regulate brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus is a region of the brain that processes both sound and the emotional tone behind it. It also seems to play a role in how the body moves in response to sound. While it’s not a conventional target for DBS, stimulating this region was found to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19990-y"&gt;ease catalepsy&lt;/a&gt; (loss of voluntary movement) in rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That finding raised the question of whether the inferior colliculus may send signals to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is responsible for initiating and controlling voluntary movement. This region also receives input from the &lt;em&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/em&gt; of the basal ganglia, a key region affected in Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a technique called optogenetics, which allowed them to stimulate specific nerve cells in the inferior colliculus of rats using light. They then recorded the activity of nerve cells in the MLR using electrophysiology, which measures electrical signals in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are indications that stimulation of this region of the brain leads to activation of the mesencephalic locomotor region, or MLR,” said researcher Liana Melo-Thomas, PhD, who led the study in Marburg. “We suspected that this would have a positive effect on ambulatory ability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recordings showed that nerve cells in the MLR became active upon stimulation of the inferior colliculus using light. The response in the MLR occurred with an average delay of 4.7 milliseconds, suggesting that these regions are connected and can communicate through synapses — tiny junctions between nerve cells that pass messages using chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Simultaneous measurements in the deeper MLR region showed increased activity in the majority of cells, although nearly one quarter of the cells were inhibited by the additional activity in the inferior colliculus,” Kruse said. This supports the idea that the inferior colliculus may affect movement by communicating with the MLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then turned to a model of catalepsy induced by haloperidol, an antipsychotic that works by blocking dopaminergic signaling, to understand if using light to either activate or inhibit the inferior colliculus would affect how long the rats remained immobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After light stimulation, only the group with optogenetic activation of the inferior colliculus showed a noticeable improvement. These rats stepped down from a bar more quickly than they had before stimulation and faster than other groups of rats. This stimulation didn’t change their general activity levels or emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The present study contributes to our understanding of the neural circuits involved in motor control and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for motor-related disorders,” the researchers concluded, adding that further research is needed to understand the clinical relevance of their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

One national survey found that a growing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — erroneously thought&lt;/a&gt; it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes.

The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to those it calls “wisdom” customers, 55 or older.

ROACH: I am a 53-year-old healthy male, and I always request to check my PSA levels each year. My 57-year-old brother’s new doctor denied his request for a routine PSA check on their initial visit. She said that the test now produces more false positives and unnecessary procedures and surgeries, so she said “no” and wouldn’t order it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZB53QQL44VBA3PBJEDIVEHXSBE"&gt;Are primary care physicians discouraging the PSA test for older men now? I don’t get any push back when I request to check it. Also, I heard the digital rectal exam (DRE) isn’t as valid anymore for screening. His new doctor also did not do a DRE. I’m curious to know your thoughts are on the current DRE and PSA screening guidelines for primary care physicians? -- C.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A3OQMXJRURDKHPYEQXYU4RO6XA"&gt;ANSWER: The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a screening blood test for cancer, and the recommendation for its use has gone back and forth over decades since it’s been introduced. Since screening and prevention are my areas of expertise, I have followed the literature on the use of PSA and other screening tests very closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XOPHZZ3LMVFPNDNOADQWDYIC7U"&gt;In my opinion, your brother’s doctor was wrong to refuse to order the test. She was right that it does produce false positives, which could potentially lead to unnecessary surgeries; however, there are good ways to reduce unnecessary treatment while still ordering the test, which can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MFT4O75NHJEPHISGF6VZNNOMCU"&gt;Most prostate cancer is so slow-growing that it is likely never to bother a man until he dies from something else. So, we don’t want to operate on these relatively indolent cancers because there’s a possibility of a serious side effect from surgery, such as urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction (neither of which any man wants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FMYJDOYKVFQZHYOFGYPY64DSU"&gt;Before operating, careful testing is done on the prostate cancer, including imaging (ideally by MRI scan), biopsy with pathological examination, and often genetic testing of the tumor. Along with the PSA results, we can separate prostate cancer into categories of very low risk and low risk versus intermediate and high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ENRBLA2BRJGI7C3G2MHHESN5JM"&gt;Once we have the diagnosis, we can make good recommendations so that we can identify the rare high-risk cancers while not unnecessarily treating the low-risk cancers. Without screenings, we can’t keep rare, small and aggressive tumors from spreading until it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CNCPY75Y6RDHDPAQ4PT5KYGYBY"&gt;Now I have to tell you that age 53 and 57 isn’t so much “older,” at least from the perspective of prostate cancer screening. The most important time for prostate cancer screening is age 50 to age 70. There are some men who may benefit from starting screening at a younger age (those with a family history, Black men, and men with certain genetic risks) and some who benefit from starting screening when they’re older than 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QI7YTF5ML5FMVCQ57BUGI3XZSQ"&gt;The DRE does not add much to the blood test. Approximately 1% of men will get prostate cancer that is diagnosed by the DRE as part of combined screening. Many men will refuse screening if it includes a rectal exam. It’s estimated that 90% of abnormal rectal exams will be false positives. On the other hand, I’ve had instances where quite a few men don’t feel like they have been adequately screened unless they have the DRE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZGUOSUUGGRHEZCPBOEQL5V4FXM"&gt;I have a discussion with every man about PSA testing, and I recommend it for most men in this age group. But I only rarely have had a man say that he doesn’t want it once he understands that we won’t recommend surgery unless the combination of all the studies show that this is a high-risk situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DUCKVO43SRGT5HCEDPLVL6KSRY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OregonLive.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxOU0QtbjRsNndYT0tBakJjWE9zclZPRXVtbEp6bnBqVzZqRXRoT1RNT1RmUjNWQ25lUkZmUGhpTF9POUxyQ0JpS0FNWnJxenM1eGRORnh1NDRsdHpEY1BQeW5KczZtQWNMQlJFbElkOEx1emRWOUpidk5lenVnYTdqa19HQ19zOE1XMlJBOVNKaExYNjY2b2o1NDQtU3RqZDhhZjB3Qlc1NWJMV2RrLWY4MS10ejJybTFpN3RCd0NnQ0pPRHpENDRRSjJvUdIB3wFBVV95cUxNZ05TUlgxVXloM3hrWVdQMG82YUYyR3VUZ3c3aG1hZk1Zd1p5d2FFTDZ6aGdqYjJRSkYtcGNsSXJDUHpDc0VLc0ptNnVDNW1Nd1dRSHptT0tTSW11UGNaczVnNWNWRDhhUDFnM0NrLU14SEtYS3cyY1VZZVpCdEJPQ2VVWDNlZklpQldodnFGSVV2NzJESlQwYTdiOFhoWjBRZWJhSXNpa19SZk9GMzM1VDBVeFBwaUpnWWN5cWtxQWxhQ0hWaU56eTR6ZFJMLUhsbjRNNktjd3J6QUh0ZlVn</guid></item><item><title>一位41岁的长寿医生说，他的“生物年龄”是24岁。他每天服用3种补充剂。- Business Insider | A 41-year-old longevity doctor says his 'biological age' is 24.

If an amputation is at the upper arm, for example, they have to re-create upper arm, then the lower arm and finally, the hand. But if it’s at the lower arm, the cells have to know to grow back just the lower arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JQL4S7FNU5BUTM3K474BMW3QNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Salamanders have been famous for their ability to regenerate arms for centuries,” Monaghan said. “One of the outstanding questions that has really plagued the field is how a salamander knows what to grow back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUPCZ5RWRNECPMBP77H4QPJL2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For their study, Monaghan and his colleagues investigated a tiny molecule called retinoic acid that seems to be responsible for this careful choreography. A derivative of vitamin A, it is known for its regenerative ability and is related to retinol found in skin-care products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7KDUW7AXQRHCPFUHMZ5AQ2NLGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Anyone that watches TV for 30 minutes watches a skin commercial with retinol,” Monaghan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFXO4SE2EJALVA5IHVY4N7N5OQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His team worked with axolotls that had been genetically engineered so that their tissue glows in the presence of the acid, allowing real-time tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGG4NNN7NNFCHLKCE56DBVDAZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then, in the name of vitally important science, the researchers did something that might strike some axolotl fans as shocking: they severed axolotl arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TQNM44G1192K3EYRXF2Q11W91M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Monaghan said his team anesthetized the axolotls before the procedure and closely monitored their health. “Importantly, they don’t show signs of pain or distress after limb amputation the way mammals might, and they regenerate fully within weeks,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJADA8BNTT0G51QMR4WHGJB7U0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When given a drug that blocks an enzyme responsible for breaking down retinoic acid, the axolotls regrew their missing limbs incorrectly, with an upper arm sprouting out where a forearm should be.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia before age 80 is potentially preventable through early intervention on common vascular risk factors, according to research led by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Findings suggest that up to 44% of dementia cases could be attributed to vascular risk factors, specifically hypertension, diabetes, or smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; rates continue to rise globally, efforts to prevent or delay onset remain constrained by an incomplete understanding of its origins. Hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are commonly implicated risk factors, likely acting through arteriosclerotic cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSVD is a catch-all term for a variety of conditions resulting from damage to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/small+blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;small blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Narrowing, hardening, or obstruction of small blood vessels in the brain can starve brain cells of oxygen, which can damage nearby brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms are often easily confused with, or overlap with, the normal effects of aging. Mental fog, forgotten names, misplaced objects, can occur naturally throughout a lifetime of remembering things, such that when vascular-related damage reaches the point of a dementia diagnosis, it may appear as a rapid onset, usually presenting later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribution is further complicated by the frequent co-occurrence of vascular injury and Alzheimer's pathology, leaving unresolved how much dementia could be prevented by controlling vascular conditions earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Contribution of Modifiable Midlife and Late-Life Vascular Risk Factors to Incident Dementia," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2834600" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed a prospective cohort analysis to estimate the proportion of dementia attributable to midlife and late-life &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vascular+risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vascular risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Analyses drew on 33 years of follow-up from over 12,000 adults across four US communities, with participant age at vascular risk measurement ranging from 45 to 74 years. Dementia incidence was tracked through standardized clinical assessments, proxy interviews, and linked medical records. Analyses were limited to self-identified Black and white participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among participants with vascular risk factors measured at ages 45–54, 21.8% of dementia cases by age 80 were attributable to those risks. This proportion increased to 26.4% when measured at ages 55–64, and to 44.0% at ages 65–74. For dementia occurring after age 80, attributable fractions dropped sharply to between 2% and 8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses revealed higher attributable risk in APOE ε4 noncarriers (up to 61.4% for those aged 65–74), Black participants (up to 52.9%), and females (up to 51.3%). APOE ε4 noncarriers are individuals who lack the gene variant with the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In this lower genetic-risk group, modifiable vascular conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking accounted for a greater share of dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude, "Results suggest that maintaining ideal vascular health into late life could substantially reduce dementia risk before age 80 years."&lt;/p&gt;

Not only are they aesthetically pleasing, but essential oils also have much to offer in their therapeutic potential. Among such herbs that have received quite an attractive amount of attention for having extraordinary cognitive enhancement powers is rosemary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landmark study in 2003 by researchers at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10808709_Aromas_of_rosemary_and_lavender_essential_oils_differentially_affect_cognition_and_mood_in_healthy_adults" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; Northumbria University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, such as Dr. Mark Moss, examined whether rosemary and lavender essential oil scents could have any impact on cognition and mood in healthy adults. The findings of this research triggered widespread interest and remain highly relevant even today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The rationale behind this study&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It aimed at ascertaining what might happen to participants' cognitive performance and mood when exposed to rosemary or lavender essential oil. Research had been based on the premise that smells are able to affect the brain activity. The hypothesis was that smells would be able to affect the central nervous system or provoke memory-based responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, 144 healthy volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three rooms: one scented with rosemary essential oil, one with lavender essential oil, and one unscented control room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five minutes before testing commenced, their respective essential oils were diffused for a consistent aromatic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measurement of cognitive function&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent a series of cognitive tests focusing on working memory, attention, recall speed, and mental arithmetic. Alongside these, they completed mood assessments using validated psychological scales to gauge feelings such as alertness, contentment, and calmness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What set this study apart was its attempt to link the biochemical composition of essential oils—especially 1,8-cineole, a compound found in rosemary to actual performance changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were indeed fascinating. The study subjects who received rosemary oil always did better than the control and the lavender groups in memory tests. Their scores in mental arithmetic speed and accuracy were much higher, particularly on serial subtractions that require hard concentration of mind and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the research discovered a positive relationship between blood levels of 1,8-cineole and enhanced cognitive function. That is, the higher the amount of this compound that was absorbed, presumably via inhalation, the better the test subjects performed. This indicated a dose-response relationship, further supporting the hypothesis that rosemary oil's active constituents were directly impacting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants in the room's lavender scent were relaxed and content but their cognitive performance was relatively lower. This is in line with lavender's calming and sedative effects that can be of immense help in stress relief but would need a lot of caution in tasks requiring heightened alertness or sharp mental agility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did rosemary work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supposed mechanism of action of rosemary in enhancing cognition centers on its main constituent, 1,8-cineole. This terpene affects neurotransmitter activity, especially acetylcholine, which is responsible for memory, learning, and concentration. The supposed mechanism by which 1,8-cineole acts is through the inhibition of the enzyme in charge of the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing its availability in the brain and assists in mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is comparable to certain pharmaceutical cognitive enhancers or nootropics, but rosemary provides a natural, non-surgical option with little or no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applications in everyday life&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applications of these results are extensive. For instance, rosemary essential oil may be utilized in schools as a means of enhancing focus for students when studying or taking exams. In the workplace, diffusing rosemary oil in offices may have the potential to enhance memory retention, alertness, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing interest is also observed in the use of rosemary aromatherapy for cognitive care of the elderly, including those suffering from mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease. Although additional clinical studies are required, preliminary signs look encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2003 Northumbria University study was one of the first to scientifically establish a clear link between aromatherapy and cognitive function, and it opened doors for more research in this area. While rosemary may never replace traditional cognitive therapies or medication, its potential as a safe, accessible, and affordable tool for mental performance is undeniable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you're feeling groggy or inattentive, think about having a sniff of rosemary or diffuse its essential oil.

Of these, 1,320 had pre-diabetes at the start of the study, which meant they were at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were started on obesity treatments between 2021 and 2023 with semaglutide or tirzepatide injectables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following up on the participants a year after starting with the treatment, the average weight loss among those who discontinued injections within three months was 3.6 per cent, compared to 6.8 per cent in those who discontinued within 3-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mean percentage weight reduction at one year was 8.7 per cent, and it was 3.6 per cent with early discontinuation (three months), 6.8 per cent with late discontinuation (3-12 months) and 11.9 per cent with no discontinuation," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, those on a high-maintenance dosage -- the amount required to sustain the effects of the medication -- lost 13.7 per cent of their body weight with semaglutide and 18 per cent with tirzepatide, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the participants having pre-diabetes, 33 per cent of those who stopped taking injections within three months experienced normal blood sugar levels, compared to 41 per cent who discontinued within 3-12 months, and 67.9 per cent of those who did not discontinue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The average weight reduction in this cohort was lower than that observed in the main phase 3 (clinical) trials, likely because of higher rates of discontinuation and lower maintenance dosages," the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified that those not discontinuing medications or taking a high-maintenance dose were among the factors related to more chances of losing at least 10 per cent of one's body weight in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, over a fifth of the study group was found to have discontinued their medications within three months of the study's start, while 32 per cent discontinued within 3-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reasons for discontinuing treatment included costs and insurance-related issues, side effects and medication shortages, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Army recruits exposed to CS tear gas just once during basic training had a much higher likelihood of developing respiratory illnesses such as viral illnesses like influenza, pneumonia, or bronchitis. That study and others led the American Thoracic Society in 2020 to call for a moratorium on the use of tear gas and other chemical agents during racial justice protests. One worry was that their use could increase the chances of getting sick with Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The science used to justify the use of tear gas is outdated,” says Sven-Eric Jordt, an associate professor of anesthesiology, pharmacology, and cancer biology at Duke University School of Medicine who helped author the American Thoracic Society recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Much of the research into the health effects of exposure to tear gas and other chemical agents is based on military research that was conducted in the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s on young, healthy men. He says those studies do not address the potential health effects on a broader civilian population. They also don't take into account more advanced launching technologies developed in recent years that allow for the deployment of much higher amounts of tear gas over longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In some cases, the effects of these agents are not due to the chemicals themselves. “People can be injured when in contact with the canisters used to disperse the gas, and this can include blunt trauma or burn injuries,” Calello says.

Their name is a bit misleading, says Rohini Haar, an emergency physician and medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, considering many rubber bullets are actually made of hard plastic or foam and some even have a metal core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“They're not less lethal if they're used lethally,” says Haar, who is also an adjunct professor of epidemiology at UC Berkeley. “There are many, many instances of them causing death, and there's also a lot of trauma that can be caused, even if they don't penetrate the skin.” The biggest concern comes if these projectiles hit the neck or face, especially the eyes. There have been cases of rubber bullets causing blindness, traumatic brain injury, and disfigurement, and less seriously, broken bones in other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/12/e018154"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by Haar and her colleagues found that around 3 percent of people hit by rubber bullets died from the resulting injury, while 15 percent of the 1,984 people studied were permanently injured.

When it’s possible, remove contaminated clothing and wash with copious amounts of soap and water. If experiencing severe symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If you plan to attend a protest, consider wearing closed-toe shoes and long sleeves.

To facilitate this, Outro partners with compounding pharmacies to produce custom versions of generic antidepressants in minuscule doses that are not available commercially. In other words, while Outro promotes itself as a service for getting off medication, part of its business model hinges on people continuing to take the compounded drugs its clinicians prescribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Horowitz, who has become one of the UK's leading experts on medication tapering, known as de-prescribing, says his interest in the topic was driven by his own harrowing experience coming off antidepressants more than a decade ago when he was a psychiatry doctoral student. Horowitz crafted a gradual tapering plan for himself that involved using syringes from his research lab to dole out small liquid doses of escitalopram, known by the brand name Lexapro. But he couldn’t prevent the misery induced by discontinuing the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“My life exploded,” Horowitz says. His symptoms, which included severe insomnia and dizziness, were so debilitating that he moved back in with his parents. “It took me years to come off, not weeks as guidelines recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;After he recovered, Horowitz began pushing for doctors to adopt new clinical guidelines for getting off antidepressants. He coauthored the Royal College of Psychiatry's guidance for psychiatric drug cessation and joined the UK’s National Health Service as a clinical research fellow. His goal with Outro is to bring the guided tapering methods he has developed to a new patient base in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Goode, Outro’s CEO, has a background working in pharmaceuticals and telehealth that includes stints at Novo Nordisk and the psychedelic therapy startup Field Trip Health, now known as Stella. “People kept asking how to use psychedelics to get off antidepressants,” Goode says, which led him to suspect there might be a substantial swath of the population who wanted help quitting the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Horowitz and Goode cofounded Outro in 2022 along with another Field Trip alum, Tyler Dyck. The company’s small team also includes Adele Framer, the founder of Surviving Antidepressants, a long-running forum where people swap tips on how to taper off this class of medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s a fraught moment to be launching a health startup in the US focused on getting people off psychiatric drugs. The US secretary of health and human services, Robert F.

Does it stop about there? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Or does it extend pass your palm like these? If it does that is a positive thumb-palm test.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your thumb extends past your palm this could mean your connective tissues are 'very stretchy', he said, indicating that the same stretchiness applies to the tissues in the arteries, meaning a high chance of swelling or bulging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went on to detail a 2021 study, published in the American Journal of Cardiology, which found 60 per cent of people with known aortic aneurysms had a positive palm-thumb test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjoe_md/video/7513245123090681119" data-video-id="7513245123090681119" data-embed-from="oembed"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a title="@drjoe_md" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drjoe_md?refer=embed"&gt;@drjoe_md&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can your thumb predict a hidden heart problem? 🫣 The “thumb-to-palm” test was linked to a higher risk of ascending aortic aneurysm in a Yale study, almost 60% of patients with aneurysms had a positive result. But before you panic, this doesn’t mean you have one. It’s just one potential sign of stretchy connective tissue, which could also mean a stretchy aorta. If your thumb crosses your palm, especially with a family history of heart issues or connective tissue disorders, talk to your doctor. Flexibility is great… just not in your arteries. 😅 &lt;a title="hearthealth" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hearthealth?refer=embed"&gt;#hearthealth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="ehlersdanlossyndrome" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ehlersdanlossyndrome?refer=embed"&gt;#ehlersdanlossyndrome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="connectivetissuedisorder" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/connectivetissuedisorder?refer=embed"&gt;#connectivetissuedisorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="healthtips" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/healthtips?refer=embed"&gt;#healthtips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ original sound - Dr. Joe, M.D. 🩺" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7513245189529029407?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - Dr. Joe, M.D. 🩺&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Here is the test: Hold your hand up as if you're telling someone to stop (1). With your palm flat, stretch your thumb as far as you can across it, towards your little finger. If your thumb reaches the middle of the palm (2) that is normal. However, if it stretches past the edge of your hand (3), researchers say this may be a sign of an aortic aneurysm and you should get it checked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers gave the test to 305 patients underdoing cardiac surgery for a variety of disorders, including aortic aneurysms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the majority of aneurysm patients do not manifest a positive thumb-palm sign,, patients who did have a positive test had a high likelihood of harboring an aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated that around 5,000 people in the UK die from aorta-related problems every year, with aneurysms and dissections being the leading causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many aneurysms don't cause symptoms until they rupture, doctors may spot them during routine test and offer&lt;span&gt; treatments to prevent damage such as blood pressure medication. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those that do cause symptoms tend to trigger pain in the chest, neck, and/or back; swelling of the head, neck and arms; coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or coughing up blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But those with a positive palm-thumb test, 'should not freak out', said Dr Whittington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's worth bringing it up with your doctor so they can diver deeper into any sort of connective tissue disorders.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; There are over 200 disorders that impact connective tissue, but there are different types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, found 60% of people with known aortic aneurysms had a positive palm-thumb test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include genetic disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autoimmune disorders such as lupus and cancers like some types of soft tissue sarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three most common aortic-related connective tissue disorders are Marfan Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.marfantrust.org/pages/15-marfan-syndrome"&gt;over 18,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are affected by Marfan syndrome, although it is believed to remain undiagnosed in many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.marfantrust.org/pages/15-marfan-syndrome"&gt;Experts estimate&lt;/a&gt; nearly half of people who have the condition don't know it, so knowing the signs can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It can cause symptoms like heart palpitations, eye pain, shortness of breath and vision changes like astigmatism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can affect other parts of the body giving physical features like long and narrow face, limbs that seem too long for the rest of the body, and crowded teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with this condition are at up to a 250 times greater risk of aortic dissection, a tear or rupture between layers of the aortic wall, than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EDS is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders affecting the skin, joints and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

And even after early discontinuation (within 3 months), there wasn’t the rapid weight regain seen in some of the trials. Improvements in A1c were also seen among those with prediabetes even after discontinuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.24331"&gt;The findings&lt;/a&gt;, published on June 10, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Obesity&lt;/em&gt;, are the latest from a team that has previously reported on the &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/most-stop-taking-weight-loss-drugs-within-1-year-2023a1000uiq"&gt;high prevalence&lt;/a&gt; of discontinuation of weight-loss medications. Now, they’re delving further into the phenomenon, lead author Hamlet Gasoyan, PhD, a researcher with Center for Value-Based Care Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though we did know that…discontinuation with these medications is common, and we already knew from randomized trials that after discontinuation patients tend to regain weight, we don’t really know the whole picture of use patterns in the real world in terms of timing of discontinuation, and most importantly, what patients can expect in terms of changes in their weight and also, if they have prediabetes, changes in their glycemic control based on discontinuation status,” Gasoyan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding of the prevalent use of low maintenance doses and the association between that and the clinical outcomes was a surprise. “We did not expect to see such a stark difference between what is happening in clinical trials vs in the real world,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment, Timothy Garvey, MD, the Charles E. Butterworth, Jr professor and university professor at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and director of the UAB Diabetes Research Center at Birmingham, Alabama, called the study “really, really great,” and said that it fills in some of the knowledge gaps regarding real-world use of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Many] people never even fill the prescription, and then by a year, more than half are off it…This paper really documents this very well and shows it to be multifactorial. It also shows that we’re not in a position to have pharmacotherapy to treat this disease on a chronic basis,” said Garvey, who was lead investigator for several pivotal randomized clinical weight-loss trials for &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/981005"&gt;both semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/993660"&gt;and tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garvey also noted that the findings regarding sub-maximal dose use are novel and valuable. “Obesity medicine experts kind of know this, but it [hasn’t been] knowledge because it [had] never been published in a peer reviewed journal, so this makes it knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Maintenance Doses, Lower Weight Loss &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included electronic health record data from 7881 adults with overweight or obesity but not diabetes who initiated injectable semaglutide (n = 6109) or tirzepatide (n = 1772) during 2021-2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first year, 21.6% on semaglutide and 16.4% on tirzepatide discontinued the drug early (within 3 months of initiating), while 31.4% and 34.1%, respectively, discontinued later (within 3-12 months). The rest — 47.0% (n = 2874) with semaglutide and 49.4% (n = 876) with tirzepatide — stayed on the drug beyond a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, 1-year discontinuation rates in the main phase 3 randomized clinical trials were 17.1% with once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg (&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/945630"&gt;STEP 1&lt;/a&gt;), and 14.2%-16.4% for tirzepatide (&lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/975061"&gt;SURMOUNT-1&lt;/a&gt;), the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients, 80.8%, were on low maintenance doses, defined as below 1.7 mg semaglutide and below 10.0 mg for tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 6477 individuals with 1-year data available, the mean overall percentage weight reduction was 8.7%. By medication, weight reduction at 1 year was 7.7% with semaglutide and 12.4% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the average weight loss in the phase 3 clinical trials was 14.9% for once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg, 15.0% for tirzepatide 5 mg, and 20.9% for tirzepatide 15 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current trial, among those with early, late, or no discontinuation, the percentage weight losses were 3.6%, 6.8%, and 11.9%, respectively (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). The trends were similar by medication: 2.9%, 5.8%, and 10.9%, respectively, for semaglutide and 7.0%, 10.4%, and, 15.3%, respectively, for tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who continued taking the medications at high maintenance doses (1.7 mg, 2.0 mg, or 2.4 mg of semaglutide or 10.0 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15.0 mg of tirzepatide) lost a mean of 14.7% at 1 year, including 13.7% with semaglutide and 18.0% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In multivariate analysis, the odds of achieving ≥ 10% weight loss at 1 year were significantly higher among those who continued taking the medication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.68 [vs early discontinuation] and 1.74 [vs late discontinuation]), who took tirzepatide vs semaglutide (aOR, 2.46), who used high vs low medication doses (aOR, 2.39), and who were women vs men (aOR, 1.86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention of Diabetes Progression, Even After Quitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 895 patients who had prediabetes at baseline and A1c measurements at 1 year, the mean absolute A1c reduction at 1 year was 0.3 percentage points overall, 0.1 for those who discontinued early, 0.2 for those with late discontinuation, and 0.4 for those who didn’t discontinue (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001). Overall A1c reduction at 1 year was 0.3 points with semaglutide and 0.4 with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 53.9% of the baseline prediabetes group converted to normoglycemia at 1 year, including 33.1% with early discontinuation, 41.0% with late discontinuation, and 67.9% of those who stayed on the medications. Progression to type 2 diabetes occurred in 6.5%, 4.4%, and 1.7% of those groups, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a very encouraging finding, which confirms the efficacy of this medications for the prevention of type 2 diabetes but also highlights the importance of persistence with treatment if the goal is prevention of type 2 diabetes,” Gasoyan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are People Doing After They Drop the Drug?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the patients who discontinued the drugs lost significantly less weight than those who continued taking them, “weight trajectories remained surprisingly stable after discontinuation throughout the study follow-up period. This contrasts what has been observed after medication discontinuation at the end of randomized trials,” Gasoyan and colleagues wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand this finding, the investigators also looked at other measures the patients might have taken after discontinuation, such as other medications or adopting new lifestyle habits or undergoing bariatric surgery. They’ll report those findings soon, Gasoyan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, he noted, “it’s easier to maintain smaller weight loss compared to maintaining a larger weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is also planning to report findings for why patients discontinued the medications. “We are gathering information on independent predictors that hopefully in the future could help us develop a prediction tool to give relatively reasonable estimates on what a patient can expect at the time of treatment initiation,” Gasoyan told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garvey is looking forward to newer, better obesity drugs. “The unmet clinical need is a medicine that’s well tolerated, that gives us 15 or 20% weight loss, is affordable and is accessible...We don’t have that, and this is the consequence…Everyone’s fixated on [GLP-1 receptor agonists], but I don’t think we’re going to get past these [gastrointestinal] side effects…There are a lot of other drugs in early phases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gasoyan had no disclosures.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Garvey served on advisory boards, conducted clinical trials, and/or served on data monitoring committees for Boehringer Ingelheim; Eli Lilly and Company; Novo Nordisk; Pfizer; Fractyl Health, Inc.; Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Inogen; Zealand Pharma; Allurion; Carmot Therapeutics/Roche; Terns Pharmaceuticals; Neurocrine Biosciences; Keros Therapeutics; Gan &amp;amp; Lee Pharmaceuticals; Regeneron; Epitomee; Neurovalens; Viking Therapeutics, Inc.; and the Milken Family Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miriam E.

For example, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh pooled together the results of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080184/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;nine studies&lt;/a&gt; which collectively tracked more than 34,000 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older aged between six and 21 years. The study showed that that gait speed was significantly associated with lifespan. For example, men with the slowest walking speeds at age 75 had a 19% chance of living for 10 years, compared to men with the fastest walking speeds who had an 87% chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One explanation is that people who are already unwell tend to be less mobile.

They also had 'biomarkers' associated with a faster rate of ageing, such as raised blood pressure, high cholesterol, and lower cardiorespiratory fitness. The found that slow walkers  had other signs of physical ill health, too, such as weaker hand-grip strength and more difficulty rising from a chair. &lt;b id="(" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="(" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;(&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b id="read-more-from-the-bbc-about-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="read-more-from-the-bbc-about-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Read more from the BBC about the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250417-grip-strength-the-test-for-your-chances-of-living-to-100" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="test-for-your-chances-of-living-to-100" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="test-for-your-chances-of-living-to-100" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;test for your chances of living to 100&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250404-sit-to-stand-the-simple-test-that-reveals-how-youre-ageing" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="test-that-reveals-how-well-you're-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="test-that-reveals-how-well-you're-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;test that reveals how well you're ageing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id=".)" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id=".)" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rasmussen and colleagues also found that slow walkers showed signs of advanced cognitive ageing. For example, they tended to score lower on IQ tests overall, performing worse on tests of memory, processing speed, reasoning and other cognitive functions. MRI scans also showed that this cognitive deterioration was accompanied by observable changes in the participants' brains. Slower walkers had smaller brains, a thinner neocortex – the outermost layer of the brain, which controls thinking and higher information processing – and more white matter. Intriguingly, even the faces of slow walkers were rated as ageing at a faster rate than the other participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In all, the research suggests that the bodies and brains of slow walkers age at a faster rate to those of quick walkers. There were also signs that these health differences were present from an early age, as researchers were able to predict the walking speed of 45-year-olds based on intelligence, language and motor skills tests taken when the participants were just three years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lh844p.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Walking more regularly can help to boost your walking speed (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Walking more regularly can help to boost your walking speed (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"What surprised me most was finding a link between how fast people walked at age 45 and their cognitive abilities all the way back in early childhood," says Rasmussen. "This suggests that walking speed is not just a sign of ageing, but also a window into lifelong brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, readers who class themselves as slow walkers needn't be too disheartened, as there are many things we can do to improve our walking speed. As part of her research to help cancer patients, Dieli-Conwright produces exercise regimes to help people recovering from chemotherapy regain their strength. Participants are advised to increase the duration and intensity of their walking exercise every three to four weeks to improve their fitness. And there are even simpler things that people can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Take any opportunity you can to walk more regularly, as remaining physically active is so important," says Dieli-Conwright. Her tips include parking further away from your destination, meeting up with friends to walk socially, or taking a pet to the local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's important to take walking breaks, especially for individuals who have a more sedentary job," says Dieli-Conwright. "Even if it's just a five-minute walking break to go to the bathroom, or a five-minute quick walk around the block – it's vital to interrupt that sitting time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQM1BnVDdVY1Nfc2VGcVNQSUV5MzB1cWM2cGJJWWg4TGhXaGxFV2VTRjBDbEk5QmVaWXdCYldKUFlKZ3lHYmJ6OEc5Z3FlcXBQdUZIQ3NDSG5HTHVycjRwa2xOWkE5cnFSU3lkSDlqMFlaWHJZOXlIWnFfczE3aV9OU0J0dXE1TnB1Z1pNZmZMX2NHdEVxcXpfdmNGWUctVnoySWc</guid></item><item><title>如何避免游泳者的耳朵？ -《纽约时报》 | How Can I Avoid Swimmer’s Ear? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQNDE0WTVreWVrakljX09Hem1GekgxQzlUN2V4c19hbUt4dEEyb1ZKbnhfR2tjMlhZeVNFQjgyVUZzMGRITHFpQXNNcGlEUjlIVFI0TVNrbmdUX1J0NkNfZkgxbnFGRXgwRHJiSWVHckl5SmVvRnpkRFZrNXA2UDMxTlFOQ29zQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Q: Last summer, my ear started feeling itchy and really painful after swimming. How can I avoid it this year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Swimmer’s ear is an infection of the ear canal that can plague water lovers and anyone else who sweats, showers or simply lives in a humid climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Nearly &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2805359" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 10 people&lt;/a&gt; will experience a bout of this infection in their lifetime. Summer, unsurprisingly, is &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6019a2.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;prime time for swimmer’s ear&lt;/a&gt;. Both children and adults can get swimmer’s ear — and those who are immunocompromised, have diabetes or other underlying conditions are at greater risk of both getting it and having complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Not to be confused with the annoying sensation of trapped water in your ear, acute swimmer’s ear will get your attention quickly. “It’s exquisitely painful,” said Dr. Sapna Singh, a pediatrician and chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics in Houston. “I’ve seen teenagers come in in tears.” The ear canal can become itchy and swollen and may leak fluid or a smelly discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The good news: With prescription ear drops, most people start to feel better within a few days. Still, doctors recommend keeping water out of your ear canal for a week or more, depending on how severe the infection is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If not treated, complications can ensue, including chronic swimmer’s ear and, in rarer cases, an infection that spreads beyond the ear canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

First identified at the end of January, the variant—called NB.1.8.1 but known informally as “Nimbus”—is a descendant of the Omicron family of Covid sublineages, and has become increasingly prevalent throughout the spring in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The virus has mutations that may increase its infectiousness and allow it to escape certain antibodies. Nevertheless, “considering the available evidence, the additional public health risk posed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low at the global level,” the WHO wrote in its most recent &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;risk evaluation&lt;/a&gt; for the variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Like other variants before it, Nimbus has specific mutations to its spike protein. These proteins coat the virus’s surface and are what it uses to gain entry into cells, where it reproduces. Nimbus’ spike protein modifications could increase its transmission capacity and partially reduce the neutralizing efficacy of certain antibodies generated by previous infections, both of which would contribute to its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, the WHO says that there is no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease compared to other strains currently circulating. Nor have increases in hospitalizations or deaths related to its emergence been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Symptoms associated with NB.1.8.1 are similar to those caused by other SARS-CoV-2 variants: sore throat, cough, fatigue, fever, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell, respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The WHO experts explain that, although this variant may partially evade some antibody responses, such “immune escape” is comparable to that observed in other Omicron sublineages. This suggests that the mutations present in NB.1.8.1 do not give the virus increased resistance to antivirals such as nirmatrelvir, and that current vaccines continue to be effective in preventing severe disease when infected with this version of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, to those most vulnerable to Covid—such as the elderly, immunocompromised, or those with preexisting chronic conditions—Nimbus represents a new health threat, and these groups should stay up to date with booster vaccinations to ensure they are protected against Covid’s worst effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/la-oms-vigila-la-nueva-variante-de-covid-nb181-tras-su-expansion-en-america-y-europa"&gt;WIRED &lt;em&gt;en Español&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and has been translated from Spanish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPZzVzQ0pwOHpuVGlxSkRmNGtMSGtxYlBWNWpVajdseHZBOFpESDFUQUxoSm1PcTV0OVlKTm80UGJrR1liUWRhbGlabjJISG9uNG1DWmRtMGRjTnJMWU1POTZlNVIxQ0ZMQm5LYVBiMGVVOElYS1hhM2lsTTB4UldtUjJhWkpJUWF5M3RlTVZabWdSd2lBcnYtRDdR</guid></item><item><title>痤疮药物中的化学物质可以帮助肢体再生-雅虎 | A chemical in acne medicine can help regenerate limbs - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxONjloRUNITWpaaHpXNGxoa0hjS281SVdZeml5MGQ1dlFSR2N1SFZQczd3eHlycC1BSVRuSXU3cUo3Z29fSExObUN4MWxyTkstdzNsYjlRWkVNUFZhZ1NtSWx2QzFMbGFDNmhxbDROaElHRXh5dHNHOFJMU1VGWHAzTEFTT09FMkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If an axolotl loses a leg, it gets a new one–complete with a functional foot and all four toes. Over just a few weeks or months, bone, muscle, skin, and nerves grow back in exactly the same formation as the lost limb. The endangered, aquatic, Mexican salamander are masters of regeneration, showcasing the best of an ability &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/newts-toads-regrow-limbs-humans-evolution/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shared by many other amphibians, reptiles, and fish species;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shared by many other amphibians, reptiles, and fish species&lt;/a&gt;. But how do these cold-blooded creatures do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;That some species can regrow limbs while others can’t is one of the oldest mysteries in biology, says &lt;a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/james-monaghan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:James Monaghan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;James Monaghan&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at Northeastern University.

And since the &lt;a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.22057" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18th century;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;18th century&lt;/a&gt;, a subset of biologists studying regeneration have been working to find a solution to the puzzle, in the hopes it will enable medical treatments that help human bodies behave more like axolotls. It may sound sci-fi, but Monaghan and others in his field firmly believe people might one day be able to grow back full arms and legs post-amputation. After all that time, the scientists &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/body-electrician-whos-rewiring-bodies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are getting closer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;are getting closer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;New findings in an old biological mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Monaghan and a team of regeneration researchers have identified a critical molecular pathway that aids in limb mapping during regrowth, ensuring that axolotls’ cells know how to piece themselves together in the same arrangement as before. Using gene-edited, glow-in-the-dark salamanders, the scientists parsed out the important role of a chemical called retinoic acid, a form of vitamin A and also the active ingredient in the acne medicine isotretinoin (commonly known as Accutane). The concentration of retinoic acid along the gradient of a developing replacement limb dictates where an axolotl’s foot, joint, and leg segments go, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59497-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the study published June 10;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the study published June 10&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications. &lt;/em&gt;Those concentrations are tightly controlled by just one protein also identified in the new work and, in turn, have a domino effect on a suite of other genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northeastern chair and professor of biology James Monaghan works with axolotls in his lab. &lt;em&gt;Image: Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University&lt;/em&gt; Stone, Alyssa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is really a question that has been fascinating developmental and regenerative biologists forever: How does the regenerating tissue know and make the blueprint of exactly what’s missing?,” &lt;a href="https://www.umb.edu/directory/catherinemccusker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Catherine McCusker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Catherine McCusker&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston who was uninvolved in the new research, tells &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The findings are “exciting,” she says, because they show how even the low levels of retinoic acid naturally present in salamander tissues can have a major impact on limb formation. Previous work has examined the role of the vitamin A-adjacent molecule, but generally at artificially high dosages. The new study proves retinoic acid’s relevance at normal concentrations. And, by identifying how retinoic acid is regulated as well as the subsequent effects of the compound in the molecular cascade, Monaghan and his colleagues have “figured out something that’s pretty far upstream” in the process of limb regeneration, says McCusker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Understanding these initial steps is a big part of decoding the rest of the process, she says. Once we know the complete chemical and genetic sequence that triggers regeneration, biomedical applications become more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I really think that we’ll be able to figure out how to regenerate human limbs,” McCusker says. “I think it’s a matter of time.” On the way there, she notes that findings could boost our ability to treat cancer, which can behave in similar ways to regenerating tissues, or enhance wound and burn healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Mutant and glow-in-the-dark salamanders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Monaghan and his colleagues started on their path to discovery by first assessing patterns of protein expression and retinoic acid concentration in salamander limbs. They used genetically modified axolotls that express proteins which fluoresce in the presence of the target compounds, so they could easily visualize where those molecules were present in the tissue under microscopes. Then, they used a drug to tamp down naturally occurring retinoic acid levels, and observed the effects on regenerating limbs. Finally, they produced a line of mutant salamanders lacking one of the genes in the chain, to pinpoint what alterations lead to which limb deformities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salamanders’ arms know to regrow the right parts in the right place. &lt;em&gt;Image: Alyssa Stone/Northeastern University&lt;/em&gt; Stone, Alyssa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They found that higher concentrations of retinoic acid tell an Axolotl’s body to keep growing leg length, while lower concentrations signal it’s time to sprout a foot, according to the new research. Too much retinoic acid, and a limb can grow back deformed and extra-long, with segments and joints not present in a well-formed leg, hampering an axolotl’s ability to easily move. One protein, in particular, is most important for setting the proper retinoic acid concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We discovered it’s essentially a single enzyme called CYP26b1, that regulates the amount of tissue that regenerates,” Monaghan says. CYP26b1 breaks down retinoic acid, so when the gene that makes the protein is activated, retinoic acid concentrations drop, allowing the conditions for foot and digit formations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At least three additional genes vital to limb mapping and bone formation seem to be directly controlled by concentrations of retinoic acid. So, when retinoic acid concentrations are off, expression of these genes is also abnormal. Resulting limbs have shortened segments, repeat sections, limited bone development, and other deformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The promising future of limb regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Based on their observations, Monaghan posits that retinoic acid could be a tool for “inducing regeneration.” There’s “probably not a silver bullet for regeneration,” he says, but adds that many pieces of the puzzle do seem to be wrapped up in the presence or absence of retinoic acid. “It’s shown promise before in the central nervous system and the spinal cord to induce regeneration. It’s not out of the question to also [use it] to induce regeneration of a limb tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Retinoic acid isn’t just produced inside axolotls. It’s a common biological compound made across animal species that plays many roles in the body. In human embryo development, retinoic acid pathways are what help map our bodily orientation, prompting a head to grow atop our shoulders instead of a tail. That’s a big part of why isotretinoin &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001060.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:can cause major birth defects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;can cause major birth defects&lt;/a&gt; if taken during pregnancy–because all that extra retinoic acid disrupts the normal developmental blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yet retinoic acid isn’t the only notable factor shared by humans and amphibians alike. In fact, most of the genes identified as part of the axolotl limb regrowth process are also present in our own DNA. What’s different seems to be how easily accessed those genetic mechanisms are after maturity. Axolotls, says Monaghan, have an uncanny ability to activate these developmental genes as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Much more research is needed to understand exactly how and why that is, and to get to the very root of regeneration ability, but the implication is that inducing human limbs to regrow could be easier than it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We might not need to turn on thousands of genes or turn off thousands of genes or knock out genes. It might just be triggering the reprogramming of a cell into the proper state where it thinks it’s an embryo,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And lots of research is already underway. Other scientists, McCusker included, have also made big recent strides in attempting to unlock limb regeneration. Her lab published a study in April &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08084-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:finding key mechanisms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;finding key mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; in the lateral mapping of limbs–how the top and bottom of a leg differentiate and grow. Another major study from scientists in Austria came out last month &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09036-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pinpointed genetic feedback loops;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pinpointed genetic feedback loops&lt;/a&gt; involved in positional memory, which help axolotl tissues keep tabs on where lost limbs once were and how they should be structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, it’s likely to be decades more before human amputees can regain their limbs. Right now, the major findings fall in the realm of foundational science, says McCusker. Getting to the eventual goal of boosting human regenerative abilities will continue to take “a huge investment and bit of trust.” But every medical treatment we have today was similarly built off of those fundamental building blocks, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We need to remember to continue to invest in these basic biology studies.” Otherwise, the vision of a more resilient future, where peoples’ extremities can come back from severe injury, will remain out of reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxONjloRUNITWpaaHpXNGxoa0hjS281SVdZeml5MGQ1dlFSR2N1SFZQczd3eHlycC1BSVRuSXU3cUo3Z29fSExObUN4MWxyTkstdzNsYjlRWkVNUFZhZ1NtSWx2QzFMbGFDNmhxbDROaElHRXh5dHNHOFJMU1VGWHAzTEFTT09FMkU</guid></item><item><title>乳糜泻的新血液检测可以诊断自身免疫性疾病，而无需吃麸质-卫报 | New blood test for coeliac disease can diagnose autoimmune condition without need to eat gluten - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQUEF0cWNGYXZzUjJTN1VyQm5sTElUYVIzYkFKYng1eGM1M011aUtsSmZseGdWWmpRdFYyQ3RYSmI3THhLOHNlQUhqdUIyTGRGVzVoTzR0aFVuSmhXalJ4cUN3M3g3U015d1RmTmgtTmpDTWNLTy1Qd19MWmktNUZzX05WSDB6WUtCWGpFZWI1Y1J6a0E0Mm5kMHRPYlpCYm9iemdNUHBhLXVEV2JYX1pwaFVHTlRhSFlRQzgzdzdSbFd4bm5CTVZuNWdDUW51Y3lVWnVKSmhqdUh3RUU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Coeliacs may soon no longer need to eat large amounts of gluten – the very thing suspected of making them sick – to get an accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Australian research &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(25)00832-7/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published on Tuesday in the journal Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;

In 2019 WEHI researchers discovered that marker spiked in the bloodstream of coeliacs shortly after they ate gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers analysed blood samples from 181 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 75 recruited at Royal Melbourne hospital.

The company aims to get the test into clinical use within two years, Tye-Din said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b309fc4-aa08-4d10-8a40-642707943cb7" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":15,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"People with coeliac disease should not fear kissing gluten-eaters, say scientists","elementId":"8b309fc4-aa08-4d10-8a40-642707943cb7","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/05/people-with-coeliac-disease-should-not-fear-kissing-gluten-eaters-say-scientists"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers acknowledged the limitations of the study in that it only involved participants from one centre with relatively small subgroup sizes, and that children and patients on immunosuppressants were not assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several researchers had advisory, directorship and shareholder roles within various pharmaceutical companies declared under conflict of interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Peter Gibson, a gastroenterologist from Monash University, said further studies were needed, but “the science is of high quality, the numbers of people tested is large, their underlying conditions well described and the results are very impressive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The test technically is very simple so it can readily be adapted to a routine laboratory test,” Gibson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He called it a “genuinely major step forward in the diagnosis of coeliac disease at least in clinically uncertain circumstances”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Assoc Prof Vincent Ho, a gastroenterologist at the Western Sydney University’s School of Medicine, said “the test is very new and it needs to be validated across other laboratories and be cost-effective compared to current tests before it can be used in clinical practice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ho said one of the most accurate tests currently used to assess coeliac disease is the anti-endomysial antibody test, with 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ho noted the study’s small sample size and that it would be important the results be replicated in other larger studies in other centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The research … showed that in patients with coeliac disease a single dose of gluten (10 grams or the equivalent of four slices of wheat bread) was able to result in an immune reaction that could be detected on a blood sample in the lab,” Ho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This means in theory that coeliac disease could be diagnosed without the need for weeks of exposure to gluten.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, Ho said, because the test assesses an immune response to gluten, this means that people on immunosuppressive drugs may not register a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 08:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQUEF0cWNGYXZzUjJTN1VyQm5sTElUYVIzYkFKYng1eGM1M011aUtsSmZseGdWWmpRdFYyQ3RYSmI3THhLOHNlQUhqdUIyTGRGVzVoTzR0aFVuSmhXalJ4cUN3M3g3U015d1RmTmgtTmpDTWNLTy1Qd19MWmktNUZzX05WSDB6WUtCWGpFZWI1Y1J6a0E0Mm5kMHRPYlpCYm9iemdNUHBhLXVEV2JYX1pwaFVHTlRhSFlRQzgzdzdSbFd4bm5CTVZuNWdDUW51Y3lVWnVKSmhqdUh3RUU</guid></item><item><title>在现实环境中发现肥胖症注射药物可产生较小的体重减轻- Medical Xpress | Injectable medications for obesity found to produce smaller weight loss in a real-world setting - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPLWUyOThLcktJcHJNaWEtbk52bVViNEpNa0x6d1ROZ2ZnWTFsaDJwT3FnVlRaUk8wTjh1ZzdybnY4NThUbk1BRl85dDl6UnpSeUUxYkZ3RC1XZG1VNjlmaTk1TEhWU19ndnhDU0xWT3RPZzM2Y2F6VERMX251WDJ5U09kQzhhOG9pdkV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Cleveland Clinic study shows that semaglutide and tirzepatide—injectable GLP-1 drugs for obesity—produce smaller weight loss in a real-world setting because patients discontinue treatment or use lower maintenance dosages. Treatment discontinuation also negatively impacted blood sugar control in patients with prediabetes. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.24331" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the &lt;i&gt;Obesity Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hamlet Gasoyan, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a researcher with Cleveland Clinic's Center for Value-Based Care Research, said, "Our study shows that patients treated for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obesity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; with semaglutide or tirzepatide lost less weight on average in a regular clinical setting compared to what is observed in randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"According to our data, this could be explained by higher rates of discontinuation and lower maintenance dosages used in clinical practice, compared to randomized clinical trial settings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide (sold under the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic) and tirzepatide (sold under the brand names Zepbound and Mounjaro) are FDA-approved medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of those medications, Dr. Gasoyan and colleagues studied their effect on weight reduction and blood sugar regulation (glycemic control) in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Cleveland Clinic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retrospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; included 7,881 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult patients&lt;/a&gt; with an average body mass index (BMI) greater than 39, which is classified as clinically severe obesity. Among the participants, 1,320 had pre-diabetes at the start of the study, defined by blood sugar levels between 5.7–6.4%. Patients who have pre-diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is one of the most common complications of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study participants began treatment for obesity with injectable forms of semaglutide or tirzepatide between 2021 and 2023. Researchers grouped patients who discontinued their obesity medications into those who discontinued early (within three months) and late (within three to 12 months). The study's follow-up ended in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that more than 20% of patients discontinued their medications early and 32% discontinued their medications late. In addition, more than 80% of study participants were on lower maintenance dosages of those medications (i.e., equal to or less than 1 mg for semaglutide and equal to or less than 7.5 mg for tirzepatide). The maintenance dose refers to the amount of medication needed to sustain a therapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year after the start of the treatment, researchers found that the average weight reduction was 3.6% among the participants who discontinued their treatment early, compared to 6.8% for those who discontinued their treatment late. Those who did not discontinue treatment lost on average 11.9% body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who did not discontinue treatment and were on high maintenance dosage of the medications lost 13.7% of their body weight with semaglutide and 18.0% with tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings about the real-world use patterns of these medications and associated clinical outcomes could inform the decisions of health care providers and their patients on the role of treatment discontinuation and maintenance dosage in achieving clinically meaningful weight reductions," said Dr. Gasoyan.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Researchers also identified what factors were associated with higher odds of achieving weight loss of 10% or more, which provides clinically significant health benefits in this patient population. Patients had higher odds of achieving 10% or greater &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+reduction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight reduction&lt;/a&gt; after one year of treatment if they:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did not discontinue their medications or discontinued late (vs. early)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were on high maintenance dosage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;received tirzepatide (vs. semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;were female (vs. male).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to looking at the factors that affect a person's weight trajectory, researchers tracked glycemic control in patients who had pre-diabetes at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the participants with pre-diabetes, 33% of those who discontinued their treatment early experienced normal blood sugar levels (defined by an HbA1c level of 5.6 or lower), compared to 41% who discontinued their treatment late, and 67.9% who did not discontinue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In our study, the majority of the patients with pre-diabetes experienced normal blood sugar levels when they continued their treatment," said Dr. Gasoyan. "Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common complications of obesity, so diabetes prevention is very important. This study highlights that treatment discontinuation, especially early, negatively affects both weight and glycemic control outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment included the cost of the medications and insurance coverage–related issues, side effects, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medication/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; shortages. A follow-up study is in the works to quantify why patients discontinue their obesity medications in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers observed that while patients who discontinued obesity medications lost significantly less weight compared to those who persisted, their weight trajectories remained relatively stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be studied further to identify what additional weight management methods patients are using in real world settings after discontinuation of obesity medications.&lt;/p&gt;
