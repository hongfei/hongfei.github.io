&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling with low energy, bloating, poor immunity, skin issues or anxiety, then your gut could be trying to tell you something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Shona Wilkinson, lead nutritionist at supplement and nutrition brand &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=fitandwell-gb-7007324559945435934&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2F" target="_blank" data-url="https://drvegan.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2F" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="DR.VEGAN" data-merchant-id="305958" data-merchant-network="AW" data-merchant-url="drvegan.com"&gt;Dr. Vegan&lt;/a&gt; (which offers gut-friendly supplement &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=fitandwell-gb-6997866224999913041&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2Fproducts%2Fgut-works" target="_blank" data-url="https://drvegan.com/products/gut-works" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2Fproducts%2Fgut-works" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="DR.VEGAN" data-merchant-id="305958" data-merchant-network="AW" data-merchant-url="drvegan.com"&gt;Gut Works&lt;/a&gt;), gut health becomes even more important as we get older—and it’s likely a part of the body we’ve overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people forget that the gut does much more than simply digest your food,” says Wilkinson. “Gut health impacts energy, concentration, your immune system, your ability to sleep and much more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, our gut health naturally changes, often in ways that impact our overall wellbeing. Maintaining gut health in later life is crucial for immune function, skin health, metabolic balance, day-to-day comfort and also our mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about how your gut changes over time and Wilkinson’s expert five-step plan on how to support a healthy gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-happens-to-the-gut-as-we-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What happens to the gut as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most notable changes is the diversity of our microbiome, which is composed of the trillions of bacteria and microorganisms that live inside our gut,” explains Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that a rich, diverse microbiome is the secret to a healthy gut, it’s only natural that issues tend to occur as this diversity declines. This imbalance, known as dysbiosis, can contribute to inflammation, reduced immunity, constipation and poor nutrient absorption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SxibJVXBs2efAtF6R4Kr7o" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SxibJVXBs2efAtF6R4Kr7o slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ageing process also slows down something called gut motility, meaning food moves more slowly through the digestive system, which can lead to constipation and discomfort. Plus, stomach acid production often decreases as we get older, making it harder to break down food and absorb key nutrients such as B12, calcium and magnesium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-five-step-plan-for-a-healthy-gut-3"&gt;The five-step plan for a healthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-eat-probiotic-rich-foods-daily"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Eat probiotic-rich foods daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods like kimchi, yogurt and sauerkraut naturally contain an abundance of probiotics— the good live bacteria that can boost your gut health, says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of your age, try adding at least one probiotic-rich food to your diet every day to help restore microbial balance and support digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-cut-back-on-ultra-processed-foods"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Cut back on ultra-processed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods often contain additives, emulsifiers and excess sugar that damages your gut microbiome and increases inflammation in the gut,” warns Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you get older and your body struggles to break down foods, it’s important to limit the amount of ultra-processed food you consume to maintain gut health. Instead, try and opt for whole, natural foods wherever possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-stay-hydrated"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Stay hydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keeping ourselves hydrated is important regardless of our age—though you may find yourself going to the bathroom slightly more often as you get older!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more hydrated we are, the smoother our digestive system runs—this helps to prevent constipation, supports the lining of our intestines and keeps things running smoothly. Whether you’re in your early 20s or pushing 70, try and keep yourself hydrated by consuming lots of water throughout the day,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-keep-moving"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Keep moving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical activity enhances gut motility, reduces inflammation and promotes a more diverse microbiome. Even a daily &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/forget-the-gym-this-30-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-clock-up-6-000-steps-and-boost-your-cardio" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/forget-the-gym-this-30-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-clock-up-6-000-steps-and-boost-your-cardio"&gt;30-minute walk&lt;/a&gt; can make a huge difference to gut function and overall wellbeing,” says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-prioritize-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Prioritize sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of sleep can have a hugely negative effect on your gut health,” Wilkinson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can disrupt your gut flora and increase the amount of stress hormones in the body, which in turn can affect digestion. Counter this by trying to keep a regular bedtime, limit screen use before bed, and avoid caffeine in the afternoon to ensure a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

Rich in antioxidants and naturally occurring compounds, coffee has been associated with improved cognitive function, better metabolic health, and reduced risk of certain chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s. However, many people unknowingly develop habits that diminish these benefits. According to health.com, from drinking coffee too late in the day to using it as a meal replacement or overloading it with sugar, these mistakes can interfere with sleep, hydration, gut health, and overall wellness. Health experts weigh in on the most common coffee-drinking mistakes and how to correct them for optimal results and sustained energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 daily &lt;keyword id="27876272" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="coffee-drinking-habits" source="keywords"&gt;coffee drinking habits&lt;/keyword&gt; that could be harming you &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking coffee too late can disrupt sleep quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine, the primary stimulant in coffee, can linger in the bloodstream for several hours, potentially interfering with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Studies have shown that consuming coffee even six hours before bedtime can significantly reduce sleep duration and quality. Since restorative sleep is essential for immune function, mental clarity, and overall health, experts recommend avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better sleep hygiene, stop consuming caffeinated beverages at least six hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unfiltered coffee may increase LDL cholesterol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While French press, Turkish coffee, and espresso are popular for their bold flavor, these brewing methods produce unfiltered coffee, which contains higher levels of diterpenes—specifically kahweol and cafestol. These compounds have been shown to elevate LDL (bad) cholesterol, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Choose filtered brewing methods like drip or pour-over to minimize the intake of cholesterol-raising compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excess &lt;keyword id="27355007" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sugar-in-coffee" source="keywords"&gt;sugar in coffee&lt;/keyword&gt; undermines its health benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding large amounts of sugar, flavored syrups, or artificial creamers to coffee can turn a health-promoting beverage into a source of empty calories and added sugars. High sugar intake is linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and even mental health issues. It also disrupts the gut microbiome, which plays a vital role in immune function and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim to enjoy coffee black or lightly sweetened with natural alternatives to preserve its benefits without the sugar overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking coffee immediately after waking may blunt its effectiveness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people reach for their first cup of coffee as soon as they wake up, but doing so can interfere with the body's natural production of cortisol, a hormone that helps regulate energy levels. Drinking coffee too early may also disrupt adenosine, a neurotransmitter that helps promote restful sleep and wakefulness balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying coffee intake slightly may make it feel more effective and reduce your dependence on caffeine throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coffee should never replace a balanced meal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although coffee can slightly suppress appetite and is often associated with weight loss, it is not a suitable substitute for a meal. Coffee lacks essential nutrients such as protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins required for sustained energy, blood sugar balance, and metabolic health. Skipping meals in favor of caffeine can result in mood swings, fatigue, and nutritional deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consume coffee alongside a balanced meal, particularly breakfast, to support metabolic function and avoid energy crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How smarter coffee habits can improve your well-being&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can be a powerful ally in promoting mental alertness, metabolic health, and overall wellness—if consumed correctly. Small changes in your coffee habits, such as avoiding late-day caffeine, limiting sugar, choosing filtered brewing methods, and ensuring it complements rather than replaces meals, can help you maximize its benefits without compromising your health. With expert-backed guidance, your daily cup of coffee can remain both a satisfying ritual and a health-positive habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/i-eat-a-donut-every-morning-elon-musks-surprisingly-fitness-routine-and-diet-unveiled/articleshow/122759263.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;‘I eat a donut every morning’;

When the supply of test kits and first-line treatments is disrupted, malaria cases and deaths will spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children under the age of five account for 14% of total malaria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zimbabwe has set out to eliminate malaria by 2030, in line with the ambitious &lt;a href="https://alma2030.org/about-alma/our-role/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;goal set by the African Union&lt;/a&gt;, using various strategies such as raising community awareness, preventing mosquito bites with insecticide-treated nets and spraying, as well as improving surveillance systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Henry Madzorera, a former health minister, said Zimbabwe should mobilise its own resources to bridge the funding gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have a lot of taxes earmarked for the health sector – let us use them wisely for health promotion and disease prevention,” he said. “People must be treated early for malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The country should not rely on donors to do malaria-elimination activities,” Madzorera added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/zimbabwe/2024/disbursements/1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;USAID disbursed $270m for health and agriculture programmes&lt;/a&gt; in Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="58c24f09-be9b-4a59-afcb-1705eebf214f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;In 2024, USAID provided $270m for health and agriculture programmes in Zimbabwe, such as this dam.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: USAID&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zimbabwe’s deputy health minister, Sleiman Kwidini, admitted the funding gap left by the US cuts had disrupted the provision of mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are now taking over the procurement of those nets after the US withdrew funding. We have just been disturbed, but our vision is to eliminate malaria by 2030,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Sungano Mharakurwa, director of Africa University’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaria" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; Institute, said it would take time to recover lost ground but added: “If we get funding, we can hit the ground running and promptly return to scoring successes again, until we beat this deadly scourge that is malaria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6c6c44e3-7c3d-428e-a2b6-9c7af00598d7" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How will Trump and Musk’s freeze on USAid affect millions around the world?","elementId":"6c6c44e3-7c3d-428e-a2b6-9c7af00598d7","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/20/how-will-trump-and-musk-freeze-on-usaid-affect-millions-around-world"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He said that since the Zento mosquito surveillance programme began in Manicaland province, there had been a marked reduction in malaria cases and it was about to be extended when the US cuts came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working with the National Malaria Control Programme, it had just been expanded,” Mharakurwa said. “It was poised to run for five years with national coverage when it was abruptly terminated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Africa University data shows that Manicaland recorded 145,775 malaria cases in 2020 but just 28,387 after Zento was introduced in 2021. Malaria cases in the province had been further reduced to 8,035 by 2024 before more than trebling to 27,212 the following year, when US funding was cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mharakurwa said: “The malaria was back with a vengeance straight after, and [numbers of] cases that were waning rebounded in 2025, surpassing levels that had ever been seen since the beginning of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Above-normal rains this year, which aided malaria transmission, had worsened the situation, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxOcXRrZjZzbEhvR19OVm1abUo1bnhqcktrOFVUUkVzNEFPQktCWjd0STFaRVFfM1A3UGc5Wm1VR1BWMmlnSmM2OTh3c0NLa1czR0QwbEpqaktqdkVJckEtcXMzMGdHOGgtYldjTEJkM28tQUJsUXpxUjlsZkY4c0FpUnF5cHQ0WC1NZFk1dE5mQUdYWXI5ay1IbXVCSS0xQWtERmhQSmlsNXVxWlFDejZNQmNwMU42WXowQUw0c2FaTUlGanlpVzY4NXVURQ</guid></item><item><title>结肠癌：如何通过饮食、运动自然降低风险-印度时报 | Colon cancer: How to lower your risk naturally with diet, exercise - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is no small deal, it's the third most common cancer worldwide and the second biggest cause of cancer-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s even more alarming? Cases in people under 50 have been on the rise for at least the past 20 years, maybe even 30. That steady climb has experts seriously concerned. According to the latest numbers from IARC, around 1.9 million people are diagnosed with it every year, and over 900,000 lose their lives to it globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why Daycare Cancer Centres Are a Game-Changer: Expert Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of colon cancer in the United States is significant. In 2025, an estimated 154,270 new cases of colon cancer are expected to be diagnosed, representing about 7.6% of all new cancer cases. The incidence rate stands at approximately 37.1 new cases per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower the risk of colon cancer, the following are science backed strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get regular screenings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting at age 45, regular colorectal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/prevention/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;screenings &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are one of the most effective ways to prevent colon cancer. Screenings like colonoscopies can detect precancerous polyps—tiny growths in the colon or rectum that could turn into cancer over time. Removing them early prevents cancer before it starts. If you have a family history or other risk factors, you may need to start even earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenings save lives by catching problems before symptoms appear. Talk to your doctor about which screening method is best for you and how often you should get tested based on your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which step do you think helps more in preventing colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying extra weight, especially around the belly, can increase inflammation and affect hormone levels that may raise your risk of colorectal cancer. Obesity is a major risk factor, so maintaining a healthy body weight through balanced eating and regular exercise is essential. Even losing a small amount of weight can make a big difference. Focus on gradual, sustainable habits like cutting back on processed foods, reducing portion sizes, and staying active. Avoid crash diets or quick fixes. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stay physically active&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days does more than just burn calories—it also lowers colon cancer risk. Physical activity helps regulate digestion, reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and boost immune function. Regular movement also helps counteract the harmful effects of prolonged sitting, which has been linked to higher cancer risk. You don’t need to be a gym rat—brisk walking, cycling, dancing, swimming, or even gardening count. The key is consistency. Bonus: exercise also reduces your risk for heart disease and boosts mood, so it’s a win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat more plants &amp;amp; fiber&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet full of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts provides fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support colon health. Fiber keeps things moving in your digestive tract, helping to flush out potential carcinogens. It also feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which can reduce inflammation and support immune function. Aim for a colorful plate—greens, berries, carrots, beans, brown rice, oats. These natural, nutrient-dense foods have been linked with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Processed snacks and sugar? Not so much. Your colon will thank you for going green and whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut back on red &amp;amp; processed meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a burger now and then won’t doom you, studies consistently show that high consumption of red meat—like beef, pork, and lamb—and especially processed meats like bacon, sausage, and deli slices can increase your risk of colon cancer. These meats contain compounds that can damage the lining of your colon, especially when cooked at high temperatures. Try swapping meat for plant-based proteins like lentils, beans, tofu, or lean poultry and fish. If you do eat red meat, keep portions small and limit frequency. Save the bacon for special occasions—your gut health depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limit alcohol intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer, especially if consumed regularly and in large amounts. Alcohol can damage the cells lining your colon and lead to inflammation, which may trigger cancer development over time. To lower your risk, stick to moderate drinking: no more than one drink per day for women and two for men—or better yet, cut back further or avoid it altogether. Swap alcohol with sparkling water, herbal tea, or mocktails for a healthier routine. Your liver, colon, and energy levels will all benefit from the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don’t smoke&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking is a well-known cause of lung cancer, but it also significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer. The harmful chemicals in tobacco travel through your bloodstream and digestive tract, damaging colon tissue and potentially leading to cancer over time. The longer you smoke, the higher the risk—but quitting at any stage brings benefits. If you smoke, get help to stop. Use nicotine patches, support groups, or talk to your doctor about quitting strategies. It’s one of the single best things you can do for your overall health—including your colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watch how you cook meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilling, frying, or broiling meat at high temperatures can produce harmful chemicals like heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may increase &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;risk. You can reduce this risk by marinating meat before cooking (which can lower harmful compounds), flipping meat frequently to avoid charring, or using lower-heat cooking methods like baking or steaming. Choose lean cuts, trim visible fat, and avoid overcooking. If you love BBQ, balance it out with plenty of vegetables and fiber-rich sides. It’s not just what you eat—it’s also how you cook it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combine healthy habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no magic pill for cancer prevention, but the combo of multiple healthy habits has a powerful effect. Getting screened, exercising, keeping your weight in check, eating plant-based, skipping tobacco, limiting alcohol, and cooking smart all add up. Each habit stacks your odds in your favor and helps your body stay strong. Prevention isn't about perfection—it’s about giving yourself the best possible shot at long-term health. Make small changes, stay consistent, and remember: your daily choices can protect your future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You’re told it's generally safe aside from needing a bit more sleep, and sometimes feeling like your head’s in a fog. But now... headlines say it might increase your risk of dementia by up to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you yank your prescription and panic-type in Google, let’s break down what this all means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin is a medication first approved in 1993 for treating epilepsy. Soon after, its knack for reducing nerve pain—from post-shingles neuralgia to diabetic neuropathy—made it wildly popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s generally considered safer and less addictive than opioids. Side effects? Sure—sleepiness, dizziness, headaches, nausea. But for many, the relief from chronic pain outweighs those little annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New study: What did researchers do and find?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40639955/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine analyzed records from 68 U.S. health systems, comparing patients with chronic low back pain. The ones who’d had six or more prescriptions of gabapentin were 29% more likely to develop dementia, and 85% more likely to experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI)—all within a decade of their first pain diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The darker stat? People with 12 or more prescriptions faced a 40% increased dementia risk and a 65% bump in MCI risk versus those with fewer prescriptions. Age mattered too. Those aged 35–64 saw more dramatic effects, with dementia risks doubling for 35–49-year-olds and MCI risk tripling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you ditch Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not without having a word with your doctor. Here’s the smart play:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors might explore alternatives, such as topical therapies, antidepressants (off-label), or even non-drug therapies like mindfulness or physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle remains king: exercise, brain games, healthy diet—all proven to protect cognition .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about other dementia-linked medications?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about gabapentin.

But could it also dull cognition over time? Possibly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic pain itself is linked to faster memory decline. So is pain causing dementia, or is gabapentin? Hard to say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of physical activity and social isolation often accompany chronic pain—and both are known dementia risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it might be a combination of factors, not just the drug itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should you do if you’re on Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mini checklist to guide your next steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your doctor—especially if you’ve been prescribed gabapentin frequently or long-term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about brain monitoring: cognitive assessments every year or two could catch changes early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore alternatives: viability depending on your condition—other meds or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boost lifestyle defenses: walk, chat, do puzzles, eat well. (Yep, the brain benefits from spinach and Sudoku.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate your support system: family and friends can help notice memory lapses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t abruptly quit: stopping suddenly could worsen pain or trigger withdrawal—the switch should be managed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin has been a go-to painkiller, especially as we try to avoid opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests a link to dementia risks, particularly with frequent/prolonged use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not a deal-breaker—especially if you use it responsibly and under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this is a wake-up call: time to talk to your doctor, think critically, and monitor brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin-dementia risk FAQs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does gabapentin really increase the risk of dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent research suggests that long-term or frequent use of gabapentin may be associated with a higher risk of developing dementia or mild cognitive impairment. However, the study was observational, so it doesn't prove causation. It highlights the need for more research and regular cognitive monitoring in long-term users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is most at risk from gabapentin-related cognitive issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that people aged 35 to 64, especially those who had 6 or more prescriptions over time, were at higher risk. Those with 12 or more prescriptions had up to a 40% increased risk of developing dementia compared to people who used less or none.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I stop taking gabapentin if I’m currently using it for pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No—do not stop taking gabapentin suddenly, especially without consulting your doctor. If you're concerned, speak with your healthcare provider to review your dosage, explore alternatives, or discuss ways to monitor your cognitive health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there safer alternatives to gabapentin for managing nerve pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, depending on your condition. Alternatives include physical therapy, certain antidepressants, topical treatments, or other medications. Your doctor can recommend the best option based on your specific needs and health history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I protect my brain health while managing chronic pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides regular medical reviews, focus on brain-friendly habits: stay physically active, eat a balanced diet, manage stress, stay socially connected, and challenge your mind with puzzles, reading, or learning. These lifestyle habits can support cognitive function even while managing long-term pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 01:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>埃尔帕索医生因处方不当导致患者用药过量而受到纪律处分- KFOX | El Paso doctor disciplined for improper prescribing leading to patient overdoses -

						&lt;p&gt;Multiple children have been treated in Wake County emergency
rooms for a rare, but painful skin condition in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly Rund shared her five-year-old daughter Lexi was in so
much pain last weekend that it caused Lexi to scream when she was touched. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“At first I thought it was hand-foot-and-mouth, and I
noticed she had a blister,” Holly recalled. “There were two on her legs and one
on her side.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi’s pain grew worse, and she said her skin became itchy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The one on her side, when I looked at it, that was when I
knew something wasn’t right. It was yellow and puffed out and really big,” Holly
said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi described her symptoms in three simple words: “It
really hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother took her daughter to the WakeMed Raleigh
emergency department on Sunday to get examined. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That’s when the Runds learned Lexi had a rare but painful
condition called staphylococcal scalding skin syndrome (SSSS), also known as
Ritter’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi was kept overnight and treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Graham Snyder is an emergency physician who sees patients
at WakeMed Raleigh and is the medical director of the hospital system’s medical
simulation center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician shared he treated a different patient with the
same condition earlier this week. It was the first time he'd seen the condition this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When I walked in the room and saw a patient recently, my first
thought was ‘Oh this is impetigo,’ which is just a little thing kids get from
scratching mosquito bites,” Snyder said. “The thing that was different was the
child had redness over their entire body, and their skin hurt. Normally rashes
don’t hurt. They may itch, but if a rash hurts you have to ask yourself if
something else is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder explained the bacteria behind SSSS sometimes grows after
a child gets a cut, or if they have been scratching their skin a lot – like if
they have allergies or eczema.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Staphylococcus, which is just like the staph infection you’ve
always heard of, emits a toxin into the blood that goes into the skin and
damages the skin, almost like a burn,” Snyder explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The rash and sores may sometimes be initially misdiagnosed
with pediatricians as other conditions, like hand-foot-and-mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The combination of pain being everywhere in the body and sometimes
you can have a combination of fever at the same time, should kind of raise your
suspicion,” Snyder warned. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WakeMed has seen six cases so far this year, and all of them have
been pediatric.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder says the number isn’t abnormal and added that multiple
cases have been reported within the past few weeks, which is slightly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL also reached out to Duke Health and UNC Health
regarding any potential cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Duke Health officials reported they had not seen an increase
in cases and UNC Health shared they had not seen any cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly said she wants to warn other parents to take their
little one’s symptoms seriously and seek medical attention to keep it from
spreading to others. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you see one bump and it looks like that, go in. It’s
better to be safe than sorry. There’s no such thing as overreacting,” Holly said.
&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;SSSS is contagious and can live on surfaces for 24 hours. The
condition can be serious for children, &lt;a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/staphylococcus-scalded-skin-syndrome#:~:text=SSSS%20is%20not%20a%20common,their%20noses%2C%20without%20getting%20sick."&gt;but
mild cases may be resolved on their own&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Children’s

A new monthly &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2025/07/hpai-report-72.pdf"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), which covers activity in June, said though poultry outbreaks have decreased, with only 15 reported for the month, new outbreaks in wild birds are on the rise, especially in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle, movement of infected cattle and contaminated equipment were thought to play major roles in the spread of the virus. However, outbreaks continued to occur, despite curbs on moving dairy cows among states and stepped-up biosecurity measures on farms, raising ongoing questions and intense scientific investigations into other contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fly sequence stirs new buzz&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Raj Rajnarayanan, MSc, PhD, a computational biologist with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University, noticed that H5N1 sequence samples from a house fly from California in October had been recently uploaded to GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and posted his observations on &lt;a href="https://x.com/RajlabN/status/1945958715544244693"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;. Like the virus spreading in cattle, the virus belonged to the B3.13 subtype of the 2.3.4.4b clade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Detection of avian influenza in house flies shows these insects can mechanically move virus around farms,” Rajnarayanan wrote in a follow-up post. “No evidence they spread H5N1 to people or animals but it’s another reason to step up farm biosecurity!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Coston, a former paramedic who has been chronicling avian flu scientific developments for decades on his news blog &lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/07/h5n1-in-california-return-of-fly.html"&gt;Avian Flu Diary&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/07/h5n1-in-california-return-of-fly.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday referenced a report from as far back as 2006 from Japan that showed blow flies found in the vicinity of a poultry outbreak could carry the virus and spread it by their feet or body following contact with infected material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we're not talking about classically &lt;em&gt;'infected&lt;/em&gt;' flies, it seems likely that contaminated flies may be one of many contributors to the spread of the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] virus,” he wrote, also pointing to a more recent preprint study that suggested blowflies at a Japanese crane colony could acquire the virus from dead birds or from fecal material of infected birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coston also noted that peridomestic animals such as rodents and “poultry dust” have been suggested as other contributors. “Unless and until we get a better handle on how HPAI is spreading in the wild—and among and between farms—our ability to slow or contain these outbreaks will remain limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Milk snatching’ among routes of cow mammary gland infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other developments, a Chinese research team that studied experimental infections involving different inoculation routes and resulting transmission in dairy cattle found that mouth-to-teat transmission may be how the H5N1 virus initially infects mammary glands. The team published its findings earlier this month in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaf262/8180392?login=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Science Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that virus delivered through the nose only replicates in the mouth and respiratory tracts of dairy cattle, but inoculation into the mammary gland replicates only in that mammary gland, suggesting that entry through the teat is the only way the virus can naturally infect mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because some lactating cows “steal milk” through self-nursing or mutual nursing, mouth-to-teat transmission may be the route by which H5N1 initially infects the mammary glands, the team wrote. Calves were also able to transmit the virus through nursing. Investigators noted that bovine oral tissues contain high levels of sialic acid receptors, which may facilitate viral infections through contaminated feed and water and efficient replication that can last for several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, researchers tested two vaccines in lactating cattle, H5 inactivated vaccine and hemagglutinin-based DNA vaccine. They found that both conferred complete protection against H5N1, even after high-dose virus challenge through direct mammary gland inoculation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Prolonged sitting isn’t just bad for your heart; it could also shrink your brain. This effect cannot be compensated for, even if you work out regularly. Yes, that’s right. A recent study found that sedentary behavior is linked with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline despite engaging in physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh found that increased sedentary behavior (time spent sitting or lying down) significantly increases the risk of brain shrinkage, related to risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, especially among older adults. The findings are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12070248/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Link between brain shrinkage and prolonged sitting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known that prolonged sitting increases the risk of chronic diseases, musculoskeletal problems, and even premature death. But this new study has found that it could also lead to cognitive decline. The researchers found that despite regular physical activity, older adults who spend more time sedentary show greater signs of cognitive decline and brain atrophy over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe prolonged sitting can affect brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggests that sedentary behaviour may be an independent risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that already affects millions of people across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 404 adults aged 50 and older for over a seven-year period to undestand the effects of sedentary behavior on cognitive health. The participants were asked to wear activity-monitoring devices for one week to track how much time they spent sitting or lying down. Their sedentary time was then related to their cognitive performance and brain scans captured over a seven-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who spent more time sedentary were more likely to experience cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes, regardless of how much they exercised. This was prominent in participants who carried the APOE-e4 allele, a genetic risk factor for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/alzheimers-disease-causes-early-symptoms-and-11-lifestyle-changes-that-could-help-prevent-it/articleshow/122627015.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.

Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease,” lead author Marissa Gogniat, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Pitt and former postdoctoral fellow at the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sitting for prolonged hours at work: Beware of these side affects!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age. Our study showed that reducing sitting time could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline. This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time,” co-author Angela Jefferson, PhD, professor of Neurology and founding director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center at VUMC, added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPc2R2Q1RYNERKYkFnVk1tc2Z0WjhuZ0ZXejFaSnZYREpicEpMS3BSb0twWXlJYVh3eFRMdWFXYXBMaXR4TGk1Nk9vVGpSUWJSV0VoWEMteVVWa1VCUUlLVVg4Sjh3UUUydV9TNm5GLUdlU0ltOFgxc2tXQXliWWdkMUxNeWZlNF9hbHBjNW5wQlhCUlpHVG1TdmZIaV90WXNkTUlLYW0zM05HS1BNcFB5QlMzVHdKeDVQQ2ZrZFA0SUptRzkzZ09uWHFKa1lIaFYyU3JCOXlGdFRBS0h3SThNYlhBdUVDdFRJdlMwQWpaNDFDNTBaWmhRYTVRQm9mOV9PVXlCU3h0SFVELVJ6azVfN2Jfb0VBLUJ6Zkx6b0JMdFlSUQ</guid></item><item><title>人们正在分享他们最大的“等等，什么？” ”关于女性健康的启示- BuzzFeed | People Are Sharing Their Biggest “Wait, What?” Revelations About Women’s Health - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5MMkdMWHlzdURZR2hnNWlGSlB4T09QcGt1YU5tcUJQUmZ0eklJdm5jNldvZkt3Z05WeWJJN3RWOTVwZC1Qbk9kSklxek1SSEhyZVZIUW9xcEJoSkZ5dVhBQ2g3N2t6UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

In previous interviews, Bray had said that her decision to follow VSED (Voluntarily Stopping Eating And Drinking) was not taken lightly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="6-687961d642974__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/group-speaks-out-after-woman-ends-her-own-life-by-voluntarily-stopping-eating-and-drinking/?image_id=6-687961d642974__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="After Woman Ended Her Own Life By Starving, Support Group Breaks Silence" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/group-speaks-out-after-woman-ends-her-own-life-by-voluntarily-stopping-eating-and-drinking/?media_id=6-687961d642974__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/6-687961d642974__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/6-687961d642974__700.jpg" alt="Hospital room with empty bed and flowers, symbolizing support group response after woman ended her own life by starving." title="Hospital room with empty bed and flowers, symbolizing support group response after woman ended her own life by starving." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/fotografias/quarto-de-hospital-WPtgfxGpTm0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I can no longer do any basic tasks. I can’t scratch an itch, push up my glasses, or move a bed sheet if I am too hot or cold. My talking is severely affected and I struggle to eat and it’s getting harder to breathe,” Bray had told The Mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But perhaps the worst thing, Bray explained, was watching your children cry and get upset because their mother is deteriorating, and not being able to comfort them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Watching your children grieve for you and not being able to hug them is the most painful feeling ever,” she said before her passing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The last bit of parenting I can do is to limit the suffering and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/elementary-graduation-devolves-into-brawl-between-parents/" class=" staff-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;trauma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; they have to witness,” she concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads

limiting demise awaiting her, Bray made the conscious and voluntary decision to stop eating and drinking to hasten the end of her life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, Bray had become an advocate for medically assisted euthanasia, saying that had a bill been in place, it would have saved her family from suffering as they watched her deteriorate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only last month, lawmakers in England &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;voted in favor of the “Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life)” law, which would legalize the procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the bill “now proceeds to Britain’s upper chamber, the House of Lords, where it will undergo months of scrutiny.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;VSED is not the same as medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p

U.K. said was important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an interview with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Aly Dickinson, who runs the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Living well and dying well South West’ group, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;explained that “VSED is a legal, self-directed decision to stop eating and drinking, leading to a natural d*ath,” and that it doesn’t involve “medical professionals actively ending life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson, an end of life doula in the U.K., said with VSED the only thing medical professionals provide is comfort and care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explained that planning is key when it comes to the decision to participate in VSED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Things like: “choosing the place of d*ath (typically at home, or in a hospice if the hospice is willing to support VSED, “ as well as writing an end of life plan that includes a statement of Advance Refused Treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said that when it comes to who should consider VSED, there are two main groups of people: “Those experiencing unacceptable suffering, or those seeking to pre-empt the final stage of d*ing, in order to avoid future suffering or a loss of dignity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said VSED could also be suitable for those “diagnosed with early-stage dementia who retain mental capacity and wish to avoid a prolonged decline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other possible candidates include people “living with a progressive terminal illness who have decision-making capacity,” or those “facing significant loss of independence due to frailty and chronic health issues, but who still have mental capacity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Dickinson stressed that more needs to be done to educate the public about VSED. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Stories like Emma Bray’s—shared so generously—helps bring much-needed visibility to this deeply personal choice,” she told Bored Panda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, instances of misusing MAiD were investigated by the UN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media"

the Netherlands and Switzerland as other countries where the service is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Canada, the option is called MAiD, which stands for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical Assistance in D*ing, and is performed by a qualified medical practitioner “to provide a person with assistance to end their life, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure became legal in 2016 and has been a hot button issue in the country ever since, with some people saying it’s

a coffin-like device which fills with nitrogen to bring an end of life to users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first instance of someone using the device was last September in the forests of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schaffhausen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Switzerland, when an American woman who was reportedly terminally ill chose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/euthanasia-pod-woman-switzerland-investigation-strangulation-marks/" class=" staff-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to end her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although medically assisted euthanasia is legal in Switzerland, the Sarco pod is not, partly due to the fact that the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of nitrogen in the capsule also contravened with the Chemicals Act.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only person to witness the woman using the pod was 47-year-old Dr. Florian Willet, the co-president and founder of The Last Resort, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an assisted euthanasia organization that promotes the pod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container

neck were the result of Willet strangling the woman. He was never charged, and was later cleared and released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the trauma of being detained and suspected of strangulation led to an ironic twist in the story, with Willet taking his own life by assisted euthanasia in early June of this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grlqv76pno" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the pod’s inventor, Philip Nitschke, said that his friend Florian Willet had endured too much psychological trauma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the final months of his life, Dr. Florian Willet shouldered more than any man should,” Nitschke told the BBC, saying that Willet’s arrest had left him “broken.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The BBC says Willet used medically assisted euthanasia administered in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are six countries in Europe with some form of legalized assisted euthanasia including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and starting later this year, Austria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netizens remain divided over the topic of medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVG8zUnd2UlIyVXlhU29uZmhjdEY0Z2lZYTFXTHRkejZWRmI0Nl9mRlB3VXE5TVRuSkJrdlB0TktWTlhvdlRteDQxaUx6SHRHRmd0QTg0VDFKaHVfaVlpX1JvOFRuZllfLWNzOHFOekVEZlBsM3Q5c2cyQ3BhUng4NjJCU3N3d00tdlhINjlCYUUtOW8tZ29ENjNIWFdXVEVQV1ZzVkhBZUNuX05ubEMtSWZNcjBLVmFoeWc</guid></item><item><title>癫痫患者威胁对特立尼达和多巴哥Arima医院采取法律行动 | Epileptic patient threatens legal action against Arima Hospital - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQaFZZUVo1d28yeG1aaVlDMkRVTVdfQnNsMUkwN1FqNGN0VXFnUGZqak45ZjhDTmtDLUJLanMtUGRwSlA3VmlqcjVEbkFzSmxuaEpOa3pkR1pELUR0QllxS2dJa3BLcUNndF9yVWpkangwM2dfdXNLbkNfR2pvRXpaZ3ZLV0NaSXhJUjgxZC0zNFh6VHhIcDN0NGVRZ2todw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14094834-1024x683.jpg" alt="Arima General Hospital "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arima General Hospital &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shaquille Edwards, a 30-year-old father of one, is considering legal action after what he describes as medical negligence at the Arima District Hospital which left him with limited use of his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, Edwards has been living with epilepsy, enduring increasingly frequent seizures, from every three months to nearly every month. On June 21, he was taken to the Arima Hospital during a seizure episode and was later transferred to the Mt Hope Hospital on June 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Edwards, while he was in the throes of a seizure, trainee nurses at Arima attempted to insert an IV line, allegedly causing severe trauma to his wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four days later, he was finally treated for the injury. When Newsday visited him at his Arima home on July 16. His left wrist was visibly bandaged and swollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to Edwards' claims, Health Minister Lackram Bodoe, in a brief WhatsApp message on July 17, said, "The ministry has asked the relevant regional health authority to investigate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsday also spoke to the CEO of the North Central Regional Health Authority Davlin Thomas, the same day, who was not aware of the claim but confirmed an investigation has been ordered.&lt;br&gt;
Recalling the day of the incident, Edwards said, "Honestly, it was all a blur. I was having a seizure when I got there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he was discharged, the hand was swollen, numb, and painful. Later, medical staff told Edwards it was an IV burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't move my hand as before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards, who operates a fruit stall to support himself and his daughter, says it has become difficult to pick fruit and do other basic chores as well as play with his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This hand is my livelihood. Without it, I can’t lift or move produce. It's not just painful – it’s taken away part of my income."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother, Lesley-Ann Mark, who was with him during the hospital visit, shared her concern. She and the family had visited the hospital many times before and when they got there, she suggested to staff they should put in the IV before the seizure got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they waited, and she alleges when it did get worse, trainee nurses were allowed to insert the IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They took him to the back, and I didn’t know what happened after that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark said they had initially been hesitant to speak out, fearing victimisation during future visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good experiences with some staff, don’t get me wrong,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But people come to the hospital already in pain and distress. A little more empathy would go a long way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards says his experience reflects deeper systemic issues in the healthcare system. Despite being enrolled in the epileptic clinic, he claims he has never been seen by a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve asked for a proper assessment for years. They keep postponing appointments, and there’s no follow-up care after I’m discharged. They just give instructions and send you off.”&lt;br&gt;
Medication availability has also been inconsistent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They switch my epilepsy meds all the time, first Epilim, then something else, and then something new again. It feels like I’m being experimented on. And every time they change it, my body reacts. Sometimes I end up right back in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos shared with Newsday show swelling and discolouration in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said the injury was only treated properly weeks later by a doctor who acted immediately after seeing the condition of the wound. “She didn’t even wait for wound care day, she just dressed it right away. That’s how bad it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also alleged despite being told he would be admitted for observation, he was removed from the ward and placed back in the emergency area to sit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t choose to leave. They just didn’t keep me. And now I’m left with the aftermath.”&lt;br&gt;
Edwards says his family is now seriously exploring legal options. “It’s not just about my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239666137-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about years of poor treatment, neglect, and being ignored. All we’ve asked for is decent care and a chance to heal properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he is prepared to share all medical documentation, photos, and evidence to support his case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not trying to start trouble. We just want justice, and a system that listens and cares.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

They mirror the results of similar studies in Europe that have also found that birth sex does not follow a simple 50-50 distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BA7QPHWAANAK3JLIYNVXNYADVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists have long documented a global imbalance in which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/19/see-where-women-outnumber-men-around-the-world-and-why/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly more boys&lt;/a&gt; are born than girls. The new study examined the murkier patterns of birth sex within individual families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GS3YV4XYJ5EB7GIZ4C76EYCAQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To do so, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from more than 146,000 pregnancies from 58,000 nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015. They found that some families were more likely to have children of the same sex than would be expected if each baby had an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. Moms with three or more kids were more likely to have all boys or all girls than expected by chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QX7MUMBMLZHVNP3IIQ23LZVV3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests that sex at birth follows a weighted probability and that biological influences may sway the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-a-boy-its-a-girl-for-some-parents-learning-their-babys-sex-is-a-disappointment/2018/12/12/8aef32c0-f8be-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;sex of the child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2G7Y4RPIVBBJXBR6Y5T452CTKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’ve had two girls or three girls and you’re trying for a boy, you should know your odds are not 50-50,” said Jorge Chavarro, the study’s senior author. “You’re more likely than not to have another girl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AUN7PYD2PREOPB4NNYL4YIE57I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers estimated that families with three girls had a 58 percent chance of having another girl, while families with three boys had a 61 percent chance of having a fourth boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJLGIG7YVRAZ7EFCYO262C3ZKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Maternal age is a key factor. Women who started having children after age 28 were slightly more likely to have only boys or only girls. Chavarro said this could reflect age-related biological changes that influence the survival of the Y chromosome carried by boys, such as increased vaginal acidity. Paternal factors could also play a role because maternal and paternal ages are often closely linked. But the study did not include data on fathers, which was noted as a limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MGJUNFE4ZBEJ7HFO5V7QXZAITE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also identified two genes associated with giving birth to only boys or only girls. “We don’t know why these genes would be associated with sex at birth, but they are, and that opens up new questions,” Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOF22PWULVH4FIIDPNUHH4B64E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Iain Mathieson, a professor of genetics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved in the study, said the genetic associations should be viewed cautiously. He said the study’s genetic analysis was based on a relatively small sample and may be influenced by other factors, making the results more speculative until confirmed by further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZUIS64PMJGUBDARJFDY76WFTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t find the genetic factors identified here particularly convincing,” Mathieson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ZRFJORWN5H2POSUCWTZ6DQFQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers also found that parents were more likely to have one boy and one girl than would be expected by chance, a pattern they believe reflects a tendency to stop having children once both sexes are represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YX6XXSCPEJEDVHLZBCOX5KLJWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To reduce bias from such family planning decisions, they analyzed data after removing each woman’s final child. They also excluded women who had experienced miscarriages or stillbirths to test whether pregnancy loss changed the results. They still found the same pattern: The odds of birth sex did not follow mere chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWJJ65PXBJFBBCJ53DZSX5AH6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests it may not have been so improbable for the fictional parents in the TV sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle” to have five sons or for the Bennet family in “Pride and Prejudice” to have five daughters. Even in history, patterns like this have drawn attention. King Louis VII of France, for example, remarried after his first two wives each gave birth to daughters, depriving him of a male heir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DO6FWXSB5ABBAZ53UXEW53YCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chavarro said it might take years to fully understand why some families consistently have children of one sex, but this research is an important place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NMMQB2EFAZG3LDKZE5PMHHARSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His team said future studies should explore how lifestyle, nutrition and exposure to environmental chemicals might affect these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKJJADTPKNB4JMPZRGGMDLUACE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Certain factors such as race, natural hair color, blood type, body mass index and height were not associated with having children of only one sex. But the study sample was 95 percent White and made up entirely of nurses, a group that may have different occupational exposures or health patterns compared with the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NURIM5QGI5B45FJ2UD2PEQUIIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David A.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet often used for weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study suggests the keto diet may increase the risk of all cancers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following an anti-inflammatory diet may help reduce the risk of cancer by lowering inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease still holds the top spot for causes of death in the U.S., but cancer isn’t far behind, with each condition claiming the lives of over 600,000 Americans every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And while researchers are more certain about how to prevent heart disease through lifestyle changes, cancer remains a bit more elusive. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists are continually searching for ways to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cancer&lt;/a&gt; and increase survival rates for those with the disease. Researchers from China analyzed data from a long-running U.S. survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2001 and 2018. They wanted to know what association, if any, exists between a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289764/should-you-follow-the-ketogenic-diet/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt; and cancer. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition and Cancer&lt;/em&gt;—let’s break down what they found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, almost 44,000 participants from the NHANES met the researchers’ criteria. The participants were fairly evenly split between genders, but did skew slightly more female. Participants were at least 20 years of age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All the data were self-reported, including history of cancer, dietary information and demographics. To determine if a participant had a history of cancer, they answered yes or no to the question, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary intake was calculated using the average of two 24-hour dietary recalls, which researchers used to calculate each participant’s dietary ketogenic ratio (DKR). The DKR is a calculation that indicates the likelihood of someone entering ketosis based on their macronutrient ratio. Ketosis occurs when carbohydrates, the body’s preferred source of energy, are not available. In this case, the body turns to fat as an energy source, and then the liver converts fat into ketone bodies, which can also be used as an energy source. Based on their DKRs, participants were placed into one of four quartiles, with Q4 having the highest DKRs and Q1 having the lowest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Demographics that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included age, sex, ethnicity, income and education levels, marital status, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;, smoking status and medical history. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers found that as DKR increased, so did the risk of cancer. But not just one or two types of cancer—all cancers. In other words, they found a significant association between the keto diet and the risk of developing cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these study authors note that there are likely some short-term benefits of a keto diet, the long-term risks may outweigh the benefits. Why keto may raise cancer risk needs to be explored further, but researchers provide a few possible explanations. First, they note that ketones have been implicated in increasing oxidative stress, causing cellular damage, which increases the risk of developing cancer. They also point out that while cancer cells typically prefer to use glucose as an energy source, research suggests that some cancer cells can utilize ketones as an alternative energy source to survive and proliferate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to these findings, these researchers also found that as the degree of ketosis increased, there was a notable decline in the antioxidant properties of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as trace elements such as manganese, zinc, and selenium. This aligns with numerous studies that have consistently shown deficiencies in antioxidant vitamins and trace elements can substantially increase the risk of all cancers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One significant limitation of this study is that participants’ ketosis levels were not directly measured with bloodwork. Also, information was all self-reported, which leaves room for error and bias. This includes cancer diagnoses, which might have been more accurate had they used participants’ medical records. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a ketogenic diet does have some legitimate medical uses—like reducing seizures in children with epilepsy—beyond that, it’s mainly used to lose weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The problem is following it long-term—let’s face it, one can only eat so much cheese and bacon. And while all foods can fit into a healthy eating pattern, it’s important to eat a variety of foods to ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs. Though this study can’t say that a keto diet causes cancer, based on this data, there appears to be a strong connection between the two, and more research should be done.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since we know there’s also a correlation between chronic inflammation and cancer, eating an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-8764103" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce cancer risk. An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides eating a varied, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight, the American Cancer Society recommends engaging in regular physical activity, managing your stressors, getting plenty of quality sleep, avoiding or limiting alcohol and not smoking to help lower your cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests a connection between the ketogenic diet and cancer risk. While keto may help you lose weight, the risks may outweigh the benefits. If you feel better reducing carbs, there are healthier and more moderate ways to do so that don’t go to keto extremes. To get started, choose from our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7885079/30-minute-low-carb-high-protein-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-carb, high-protein dinners&lt;/a&gt; that come together in just 30 minutes or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291575/high-protein-low-carb-breakfasts-to-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein, low-carb breakfasts&lt;/a&gt; to help you lose weight. If cancer prevention is top of mind, taking a holistic approach may not only help prevent cancer but also other diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, lean proteins and healthy fats in your diet. In addition, move your body often, deal with what’s stressing you out, get enough quality sleep and spend time with loved ones.

          &lt;p&gt;Nearly 800,000 doses of mpox vaccine pledged to African countries working to stamp out devastating outbreaks are headed for the waste bin because they weren't shipped in time, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/us-has-wasted-hundreds-of-thousands-of-vaccines-meant-for-africa-health-officials-there-say-00460290?utm_campaign=KHN:+First+Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eszRHhuI8X2faI-mZVE2luzzBgtK1oFhRnCmThGQYTOQfpxJ6mH-8hqkNJJl3U2D6dRENrJ8VXScM47-IJLTksbKauA&amp;amp;_hsmi=371897914&amp;amp;utm_content=371897914&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;according to reporting by Politico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 800,000 doses were part of a donation promised under the Biden administration, which was meant to deliver more than 1 million doses. Overall, the US, the European Union, and Japan pledged to collectively provide 5 million doses to nearly a dozen African countries. The US has only sent 91,000 doses so far, and only 220,000 currently still have enough shelf life to make it. The rest are expiring within six months, making them ineligible for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a vaccine to be shipped to a country, we need a minimum of six months before expiration to ensure that the vaccine can arrive in good condition and also allow the country to implement the vaccination," Yap Boum, an Africa CDC deputy incident manager, told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politico linked the vaccines' lack of timely shipment to the Trump administration's brutal cuts to foreign aid programs as well as the annihilation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which administered those aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;

So I’ve never been super into her, until the most recent episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/just-season-3-starts-twist-124527827.html" data-ylk="slk:And Just Like That;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In season 3, episode 8, she has an unexpected attack of vertigo, an illness that’s played for laughs but is no joke, evidenced by the polarized comments about it online. As a vertigo alum myself, I've done a deep dive into the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Near the top of the episode, Charlotte is at her gallery, assembling a mattress installation clearly inspired by Tracy Emin’s seminal work &lt;em&gt;My Bed&lt;/em&gt;, when she bends over and moans softly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Kai, may I have your hand? I think my vertigo is back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I didn’t think vertigo is real?” the gallery worker responds. “You know, like Epstein-Barr.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Oh, it’s a real thing,” Charlotte nods, woozily. “I had it last year, I had to take to my bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Charlotte’s condition subsides, then recurs during a long set piece at the gallery, in which Charlotte pratfalls while rushing across the room. Again, when Charlotte explains that she fell due to vertigo, another character looks her dismissively and says “Is that even a real thing?” Later that same evening, Charlotte is shown entering her home alone, still bent over from the condition, trying to talk to Lisa on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Craig Blankenhorn/HBO Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granted, vertigo isn’t as serious as Charlotte’s husband’s prostate cancer or Miranda’s alcoholism, but online banter calls out the show for its misinformation and insensitivity. In &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/and-just-like-that-recap-season-3-episode-8-happily-ever-after.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vulture’s comment section;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Vulture’s comment section&lt;/a&gt;, for example, Mediaqueen1985 says she has vertigo, then criticizes the depiction: “Ugh. More Charlotte as Lucy Ricardo but with vertigo as an excuse. Vertigo usually involves heights, so WTH?” Next, an ear-nose and throat specialist writes “vertigo isn’t a fear of heights, but a room-spinning sensation. Charlotte likely had BPPV, although the depiction was a little…off.” Johnandtara chimes in: “Nurse here—and I have a few friends in menopause experiencing vertigo, so I think they are throwing it into the mix as a women of a certain age thing.” And finally Nnfowlds opines: “They sent Charlotte home on her own in a vertigo state? Goofy and irritating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reality check—according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21769-vertigo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, “vertigo causes dizziness and makes you feel like you’re spinning when you’re not. It most commonly occurs when there’s an issue with your inner ear. But you can also develop it if you have a condition affecting your brain, like a tumor or stroke. Treatments vary and can include medication, repositioning maneuvers or surgery.” It may or may not involve heights. There are two main types, peripheral and central; peripheral is the common sort. A decade-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4110114/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,000 women showed that one type of peripheral, BBPV (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), is increasingly common in perimenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watching the show, I was perplexed by the lack of sympathy given to Charlotte when she's incapacitated, since I have had stress-induced bouts of the condition. Initially, I woke up with the room spinning so profoundly, alone and frightened, that I speed-dialed a friend to come take me to the emergency room. (My condition was diagnosed and I was given anti-nausea medication.) After subsequent attacks, an ENT taught me the Epley Maneuver, a head movement exercise designed to reposition the ear crystals that cause BBPV. It’s a recurring condition for me, in the manner of commenter Itcouldbeworse: “I had it for months, but only when I got up from bed too quickly (luckily.) The room would spin. Even after it stopped happening, I got up very slowly for a long while, in case it had come back. (The first time it had happened, there was no warning.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's the rub: Never once did anyone suggest that I might be fantasizing my illness, or doubting that the condition even exists. Nor would anyone have sent me home, unaccompanied, if I couldn’t walk straight. Charlotte deserves better—the poor woman is just regaining her footing, so to speak. She's just been through a recent major health scare with her husband, a massive career responsibility and caretaking a heartbroken daughter and teetotaling friend! A little information about her well-being as well as compassion for her is in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m left with a lingering bad taste about the whole vertigo storyline, maybe best expressed by Hotfoot2020: “Gross how it was played for laughs. I've noticed people aren't very caring on this show when someone's sick. Things get quippy in no time. UGH. Are there any humans left in the writers' room or is this all the work of a Temu bot?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/major-theory-just-season-3-160000065.html" data-ylk="slk:I Have a Major Theory About ‘And Just Like That’ Season 3—and OG ‘Sex and the City’ Fans Are Gonna Love it;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;I Have a Major Theory About ‘And Just Like That’ Season 3—and OG ‘Sex and the City’ Fans Are Gonna Love it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 16:40:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQalQtTFRMMk4wUUNySl85WWZMRXVyeDdqb2VaRFJSaFlLUnFUSGtOazVWdVE1cGhLdHZrOHNjaWxLeUdVYVRqLVc3MU1tbVU2T0owYzIycWFEUTBacnI4czYxZENkcGlvYS1IY25jSjYzdEVOVEk1TXNPZmw5eEJGQUhaU1h2bFlmUVBSWDEzTExkSVl4N2Y0Zg</guid></item><item><title>益生菌有效吗？ -《经济学人》 | Do probiotics work? - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTFozMU5NYmNMZFZWZGw4amRqd0tpYXlxYzFRWWNMNG9hcnMyaXM5VXAxYnlRZ3NhaU83c1JPMEZQUFRKRmhiLUNqbGxDdFRMV3FIS1dwRDdHN2YzZ29iVnlFbzNDaWdtVTNHZzREbFBrZFFObDBWOVEzSVNROE92R01jWlQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-5nzj3w ei2yr3n1"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt; DAZZLING menagerie&lt;/small&gt; of microbes live inside the human gut—by some counts a few thousand different species.

These factors damage the cells that keep your cornea clear, and they don’t grow back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the team found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine caused a patient's cornea to go from 528 to 542 micrometers in thickness, or roughly 0.0208 inches to 0.0213 inches. This is a roughly two-percent increase in micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A slightly thicker cornea isn't automatically harmful. The cornea can thicken temporarily due to inflammation, fluid buildup, or stress on the endothelium from minor illnesses or injuries to the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it stays too thick for months or years, however, it could make the cornea less clear, potentially affecting vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team did not recommend against vaccination and will still need to conduct long-term testing on patients to see if these changes continue to appear months and years after taking the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (pictured) has also been tied to rare inflammatory heart conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average number of endothelial cells, which keep the cornea clear by pumping out excess fluid, dropped from 2,597 to 2,378 cells per square millimeter in the study, a loss of about eight percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normal endothelial cell counts range from 2,000 to 3,000 cells per square millimeter in healthy adults, so 2,378 is still within a safe range for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for someone with a low cell count to start with, due to a previous eye surgery, infection, or disease, this loss could be riskier for their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered that these cells became less uniform after the vaccination, with their coefficient of variation - each cell's difference in size - increasing from 39 to 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cells die, nearby cells stretch to fill the gaps, leading to bigger differences in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could mean the endothelium is less healthy. If this trend continued for years, it could affect the cornea’s clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After vaccination, the study found fewer cells kept their healthy six-sided shape, with the total dropping from 50 to 48 percent of the cells in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthy endothelial cells are usually shaped like hexagons, which allows them to fit together tightly, like a honeycomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the two-percent drop was not a direct sign of damage, it suggested to the team that the cells might be reacting to some sort of stress over those two months to three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers said their results also showed evidence that the changes had a high likelihood of being directly linked to taking the vaccine, meaning it wasn't just a random anomaly in the testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the signs of stress and inflammation drop off shortly after receiving the Pfizer shot, the impact of these minor changes would not be overly harmful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman undergoes an eye exam. Scientists have found multiple signs of stress in the eye after taking the Pfizer COVID-19 shot (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To find these results, the team studied 128 eyes, 64 pairs in total, before each person received their COVID vaccinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They followed up with the group approximately 75 days after they got their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team used a machine called Sirius corneal topography to measure the corneas' thickness and shape, and another device, the Tomey EM-4000 specular microscope, to take detailed pictures of the endothelial cells to check their number, size and shape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each participant also took a full eye exam, including tests for vision sharpness, eye pressure and scans of the eye’s front and back parts to ensure overall eye health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By comparing the measurements taken before vaccination to those after, the researchers could see if the Pfizer vaccine was influencing the health of the eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new data on potentially harmful side-effects linked to Pfizer's COVID vaccine added to a growing list of concerns the Trump Administration has highlighted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In May, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forced Pfizer and Moderna to use &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14739333/trump-fda-covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-heart-damage.html"&gt;expanded warning labels&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of heart damage tied to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots previously included warning labels about the rare chance of patients suffering myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new labels expanded that warning to certain age groups, particularly men between the ages of 16 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that this seemingly healthy group appeared to be at the highest risk of the rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Young people appear to be increasingly vulnerable to gastrointestinal cancers, but researchers aren’t entirely sure what is driving the surge in disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a new study out this week, scientists led by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that rates of early-onset GI cancers—those occurring in people younger than 50—are rising more rapidly than other types of cancer. In particular, colorectal cancer cases have significantly increased, while rates of other forms of the disease, like stomach cancer, are creeping up, too. While the paper doesn’t come to definitive conclusions as to why these conditions are becoming more common, the researchers point to risk factors like obesity, a poor diet, and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Colorectal cancer is the most common early-onset GI cancer worldwide, accounting for more than half of the cases, but it is not the only GI cancer that is rising in younger adults,” said senior study author Kimmie Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber, in a &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2025/global-rise-in-many-early-onset-gi-cancers-detailed-in-two-dana-farber-reviews-with-colorectal-cancer-leading-the-trend"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers are also increasing in young people,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ng and her colleagues reviewed data collected from 100 studies, as well as past scientific reviews, and cancer-related guidelines. They also analyzed three publicly available cancer statistic databases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the incidence of early-onset GI cancers has been increasing globally, they found, but especially in high-income countries like the U.S. Between 2010 and 2019, the age-adjusted incidence rate in the U.S. increased by 2.16% annually—the greatest increase of any early-onset cancer during that time. In 2022, there were at least 25,000 Americans under 50 who developed GI cancer. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836671"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An earlier, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?login=false#google_vignette"&gt;separate review of data&lt;/a&gt;—by some of the same authors—over a similar time period concluded that the rate of GI cancer has tripled in young people aged between 15 and 19, and almost doubled in those aged between 20 and 24.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rising incidence of early-onset GI cancers is alarming and underscores the need for enhanced prevention strategies and early detection methods,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As the rates of these cancers have risen, so have some of their risk factors, including rates of obesity and time spent sitting; ultraprocessed foods are also more common now, especially in Western diets. Still, the researchers estimate that as much as 30% of early-onset GI cancer may be linked to genetic mutations. Other scientists have argued that other issues, like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-may-have-figured-out-why-young-people-are-getting-colorectal-cancer-more-often-2000594349"&gt;common stomach infections&lt;/a&gt;, could also be driving the increase in cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as the causes remain unclear, what is clear is that more work needs to be done to help catch these cancers early enough, before they become impossible to treat, the researchers said. In 2020, public health experts recommended routine screening for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/45-is-the-new-50-when-it-comes-to-colorectal-cancer-scr-1845499824"&gt;colorectal cancer in people 45&lt;/a&gt; and up, but the researchers noted that a year later, fewer than 20% of people ages 45 to 49 went for a screening. Another outstanding question is whether early-onset GI cancers are different from those caught later in life, and if so, should they be treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We need to be thinking not only about the risk factors for these diseases but also how to screen, diagnose, and treat young people with these cancers,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A person in Arizona has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/arizona-patient-dies-plague-rcna218251"&gt;died from the plague&lt;/a&gt;, local health officials &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/usa-plague-northern-arizona-resident-dies-from-plague/0105f663-5b94-48ac-8ae9-28a9df9a0090"&gt;reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the first such death in this region in 18 years. But it's a stark reminder that this historic disease, though rare nowadays, is not just a disease of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what actually is "plague"? And is it any cause for concern in Australia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-does-the-plague-keep-coming-back-to-plague-humans?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Why Does The Plague Keep Coming Back to Plague Humans?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are 3 types of 'plague'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word "plague" is often used to refer to any major disease  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, or even to other undesirable events, such as a mouse plague. Naturally, the word can evoke fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientifically speaking, plague is a disease caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague"&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague has three main forms: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bubonic is the most common and is named after "&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague"&gt;buboes&lt;/a&gt;", which are the painful, swollen lymph nodes the infection causes. Other symptoms include  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, headache, chills and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bubonic plague is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/causes/index.html"&gt;typically spread by fleas&lt;/a&gt; living on animals such as rats, prairie dogs and marmots. If an infected flea moves from their animal host to bite a human, this can cause an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168387" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168387" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-168387" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168387" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fleas on animals like rats can carry the plague. (Denitsa Kireva/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also become infected through handling an animal infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/septicemic-plague"&gt;Septicemic plague&lt;/a&gt; occurs if bubonic plague is left untreated, or it can occur directly if the disease enters the bloodstream. Septicemic plague causes bleeding into the organs. The name comes from septicemia, which refers to a serious blood infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent death in the United States was due to a case of pneumonic plague, which is the most severe form. Bubonic plague can in some cases spread to the lungs, where it becomes pneumonic plague. However, pneumonic plague can also spread from person to person &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague"&gt;via tiny respiratory droplets&lt;/a&gt;, in a similar way to COVID. Symptoms are similar to the other forms but also include severe  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague"&gt;30–60% of people&lt;/a&gt; who contract bubonic plague will die, while the fatality rate can be up to 100% for pneumonic plague if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plague: a potted history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disease is one of the most important in history. The &lt;a href="https://origins.osu.edu/connecting-history/covid-justinianic-plague-lessons"&gt;Plague of Justinian&lt;/a&gt; (541–750CE) killed &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; in the western Mediterranean, heavily impacting the expansion of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medieval Black Death (1346–53) was also seismic, killing &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://origins.osu.edu/connecting-history/covid-black-death-plague-lessons"&gt;up to half of Europe's population&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread by the growing trade networks of the British empire, the third and most recent plague pandemic spanned the years 1855 until roughly 1960, peaking in the early 1900s. It was responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues"&gt;12 million deaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/the-history-of-plague-part-1-the-three-great-pandemics/"&gt;primarily in India&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/bubonic-plague"&gt;reached Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's believed the bubonic plague was largely behind these pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plague in the modern day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First introduced into the US during the third pandemic, plague infects an average of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;seven people a year&lt;/a&gt; in the west of the country, due to being endemic in groundhog and prairie dog populations there. The last major outbreak was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;100 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths are very rare, with &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240220-bubonic-plague-did-the-black-death-rewire-our-immune-system"&gt;14 deaths in the past 25 years&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;a few thousand cases&lt;/a&gt; of plague over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/plague/plague-map-2016.png?sfvrsn=68bcc3ee_10"&gt;countries with the most cases currently&lt;/a&gt; include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru, with cases also occurring in India, central Asia and the US. Cases usually occur in rural and agricultural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plague can be treated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague can easily be treated with common antibiotics, typically a course of 10–14 days, which can include both oral and intravenous antibiotics. But it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/hcp/clinical-care/index.html"&gt;must be treated quickly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent death is concerning, as it involves &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/12/us/pneumonic-plague-arizona-death.html"&gt;the airborne pneumonic form&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, the only form that spreads easily from person to person. But there's no evidence of further spread of the disease within the US at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; is not found in Australian animals, there is little risk here. Plague has not been reported in Australia &lt;a href="https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/bubonic-plague"&gt;in more than a century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But plague, like many diseases, is influenced by environmental conditions.

That’s according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02857-2" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which analyzed fecal samples from hundreds of individuals and found specific microbial signatures linked to both mental health diagnoses and the use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trillions of microbes that inhabit the intestine—often called the gut microbiota—help break down food, guide immune activity, and generate chemicals that influence the brain. Over the past decade scientists have linked unusual microbial patterns to a range of mental health problems, raising hopes that diet, probiotics, or other microbe‑directed therapies could complement traditional care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet many previous projects were small, drew volunteers who were not taking medication, or came from countries where treatment routines differ from those in the United States. The new research set out to fill those gaps by analyzing gut organisms in a broad American cohort that included many people who already used pharmaceuticals for mood or anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Past work, including ours, has linked microbes in the gut to anxiety and depression. We wanted to test whether the use of specific medications had the same or different effects on the microbiome, and whether the effects were similar or different in the two conditions,” said study author &lt;a href="https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Rob Knight&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at UC San Diego and director of the Center for Microbiome Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants came from two Oklahoma‑based projects: the Tulsa 1000 study and the Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Affiliation and Personality initiative. Together they provided 666 stool samples—502 from adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or both, and 164 from healthy comparison volunteers. Diagnosis was confirmed in structured clinical interviews, and symptom intensity was recorded with standard questionnaires for anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also logged every drug each person was using and grouped those medicines with the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, paying special attention to antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and to anti‑anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each stool sample underwent two layers of genetic analysis. First, the team amplified and sequenced a short genetic marker that acts like a barcode for bacteria, giving a precise but affordable snapshot of which species were present. A subset of samples then went through whole‑genome sequencing, a deeper method that captures longer stretches of genetic material and can spot less common organisms. After quality filtering, each participant contributed the best‑sequenced sample to the final data set, ensuring that no one skewed the results by providing multiple specimens of different quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined microbial diversity in several ways. &lt;em&gt;Alpha diversity&lt;/em&gt;, a measure of how many species live in one person’s gut, did not differ between healthy volunteers and those with anxiety, depression, or both. &lt;em&gt;Beta diversity&lt;/em&gt;, which asks how different one person’s total community is from another’s, told a richer story. In statistical models that considered all participants together, antidepressant use produced the strongest separation between microbial communities, exceeding the effect linked to a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti‑anxiety medicines, biological sex, and study cohort also showed measurable associations with beta diversity. When the scientists looked only at people who were not taking psychotropic drugs, sex emerged as the lone significant factor, suggesting that pharmaceuticals were indeed a prime driver of the broader community shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that medications have a larger effect on the composition of the gut microbiome than the conditions that they are used to treat,” Knight told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinpointing individual organisms, the team compared people with anxiety alone, depression alone, both conditions, and healthy controls—but only among volunteers who were not using mood‑altering medicines. Forty‑four bacterial types were more common in anxiety, while fifty tended to be higher in healthy controls. A calculated ratio between anxiety- and control-associated microbes was elevated in participants with anxiety, in those with depression, and especially in those who carried both diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same pattern held for women and showed a weaker trend in men. When that ratio was plotted against anxiety severity scores, higher microbial values tracked with more intense worry, although the correlation was modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar hunt for depression‑linked organisms identified forty‑seven bacteria enriched in depressed participants and sixty‑four enriched in controls. A ratio based on those organisms rose in every diagnostic group compared with healthy volunteers. Again the signal was clearer in women than in men, and the ratio edged upward alongside depression severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication exerted its own signatures. Comparing people who used anti‑anxiety drugs with unmedicated peers who had anxiety revealed 88 bacterial types tied to the drugs and 77 tied to no medication. Contrasting antidepressant users with unmedicated depressed participants spotlighted 102 drug‑associated organisms and seventy‑three linked to no medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists built ratios from those bacterial sets, the numbers distinguished not only drug users from non‑users but also separated volunteers who took both antidepressants and anti‑anxiety drugs from those on either class alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore whether such microbial fingerprints could aid diagnosis, the team trained a random‑forest machine‑learning model on the bacterial data. Across repeated cross‑validation runs the model consistently identified anxiety, depression, or both with accuracy well above chance, especially when it relied on the organisms flagged in the earlier statistical screens. Performance was strongest in women, echoing the sex differences seen in the diversity analyses. A separate classifier that tried to detect medication use also beat chance, though with lower precision than the diagnosis model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For added confirmation, the researchers tested their depression‑related bacterial ratio in an independent data set from the American Gut Project, selecting more than eight thousand stool samples from adults under fifty‑six. Volunteers who reported a clinician‑diagnosed depression showed higher ratios than those who did not, mirroring the Tulsa findings and hinting that the microbial signal generalizes to other American populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also surprised by how reliable the signatures of medication use were, suggesting that they might be developed into a test that could check for medication adherence through the effects on the microbiome,” Knight explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project highlights several intertwined themes. First, prescriptions meant to treat mood and anxiety symptoms appear to shape the gut ecosystem at least as much as the psychiatric conditions themselves. Second, despite that pharmaceutical influence, certain bacteria still line up with anxiety, depression, or combined symptoms, and their relative abundance drifts upward as self‑reported distress intensifies. Finally, microbial profiles alone carry enough information to allow an algorithm to flag who is likely living with a mood or anxiety disorder, raising the prospect of stool‑based screening tools down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specific microbes are associated with anxiety and depression, suggesting that addressing these conditions may involve different strategies to target these different microbes as part of the overall therapeutic strategy,” Knight said. “Medications that target anxiety and depression affect many gut microbes including these, although future studies are needed to determine how much of therapeutic effectiveness comes from these effects on microbes rather than effects on the human body and brain directly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the study also carries caveats. It tracked associations rather than assigning treatments or manipulating microbes, so it cannot reveal which changes come first—the microbial shifts, the mental‑health symptoms, or the remedies. Dosage information was not dissected, and smaller sample sizes in the deeper whole‑genome sequencing limited some comparisons. The healthy control group also contained fewer men than women, which might have exaggerated sex differences. Future projects will need larger, balanced cohorts, repeated sampling over time, and experiments that intervene in diet, microbial composition, or medication schedules to tease apart cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators plan to probe those questions by coupling longitudinal human follow‑ups with animal studies that transfer specific bacteria into germ‑free mice. If particular microbes can blunt anxious or depressed behavior in animals, that will strengthen the case that they contribute to mental‑health resilience rather than merely reflecting it. Clinical trials could then test whether targeted probiotics, fiber‑rich diets that foster beneficial species, or even tailored antibiotic courses improve mood or enhance the response to standard drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02857-2" target="_blank"&gt;Medication use is associated with distinct microbial features in anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Amanda Hazel Dilmore, Rayus Kuplicki, Daniel McDonald, Megha Kumar, Mehrbod Estaki, Nicholas Youngblut, Alexander Tyakht, Gail Ackermann, Colette Blach, Siamak MahmoudianDehkordi, Boadie W.

The researchers specifically looked at scores for &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Life's Essential 8;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Life's Essential 8&lt;/a&gt;, a health assessment tool created by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers found that four components in Life’s Essential 8 (blood glucose, blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use) were the most important factors in predicting participants’ future risk of developing cardiovascular disease. But sleep ended up being the biggest predictor of having a cardiovascular disease event and dying from any cause. And those who had better sleep quality had a lower risk of both of these outcomes. “Midlife sleep quality may uniquely contribute to future event risk,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is sleep related to heart health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few potential factors at play here. “Poor sleep can lead to inflammation in the body,” says Jennifer Wider, MD, women’s health expert and co-host of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fid%2Fpodcast%2Fopen-wider-w-kenny-zimlinghaus%2Fid1100528546&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65382034%2Fsleep-heart-health-menopause-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Open Wider podcast;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Wider&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-023-42758-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65382034%2Fsleep-heart-health-menopause-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even relatively mild sleep problems can cause inflammation in cells that line the veins in the heart, which could significantly contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can be an indirect impact of sleep on heart health, too. “Lack of sleep may promote poor eating habits which over time can contribute to poor nutrition, diabetes, and heart disease,” Dr. Wider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent lack of sleep is also linked to high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, poor blood sugar control, and obesity, points out &lt;a href="https://www.wchriswinter.com/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:W.

Estrogen is protective of the heart, she explains. As it drops in the body, a woman’s risk of developing cardiovascular conditions, including heart disease, increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep disturbances are common during the transition," El Khoudary says. "These issues, worsened by hormonal changes, vasomotor symptoms, and other factors, can increase with age and are linked to higher cardiovascular risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopausal women also tend to see a "sharp increased risk" for sleep apnea, which usually leads to worse sleep and a higher risk of heart issues, Dr. Winter says. But Dr. Winter stresses that women shouldn't assume they’re doomed to have poor sleep—and potentially developing cardiovascular disease as a result—during menopause. “This is such a positive place for menopausal women to focus, because it is a variable that can be measured and improved upon,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you're struggling with sleep, it's a good idea to check in with a healthcare provider. Starting a good treatment plan could do more than make you feel well-rested the next day—it may support better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 14:02:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9ZV242ejhuTmVGdFZUNWNBa3YyNzk1VFNBRmVIQVd0MkJCS2h4XzNMakZSU2hGRURTWl9QSS1NRS0weF84dEhzRHVEMjA5SFMtQWJJaXdBLTlBVXJCX2pVZ1VKdVVKNEp4R3N6LVJxa2VpSEw3cjhV</guid></item><item><title>胶原蛋白注射剂和补充剂真的是年轻肌肤的秘诀吗？ -《卫报》 | Are collagen shots and supplements really the secret to youthful skin? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOW1IVnhUN2s2emFOQnRPQnZMdWxZblhwTlN3VUtjTzlJNUVjQzVYRmkwTng5cG1WUzBMMWJxaVhob216b1hidTVSNE9Wel9KRW5xMGVFbVNLLXpXbGZKVG1lenFnYW5CLWk1SDF4cDE4OGJtNkcyYW5uZUloM2xJRDBzZlF4dnVWOGZ4NEVva3QzTzZ4ZnRtUjVPeVpTaW50T0VxTWxn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;rom high-end aesthetics clinics to the middle aisle of Lidl, collagen is having a moment. Whether it’s in the form of fruity shots or powdered supplements, this structural protein is being touted as the secret to youthful skin and glossy hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Celebrities are also singing the praises of a collagen-boosting procedure called NeoGen, with the actor &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMHolloi7P5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Leslie Ash&lt;/a&gt; claiming earlier this week that it had “taken 10 years off her”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"fashion","tags":[{"id":"fashion/skincare","type":"Keyword","title":"Skincare"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"fashion/beauty","type":"Keyword","title":"Beauty"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/linda-geddes","type":"Contributor","title":"Linda Geddes"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"fashion/2025/jul/18/do-collagen-shots-supplements-really-work-youthful-skin","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But amid the glowing endorsements and glossy marketing, a fundamental question remains: can anything else really boost collagen – and is it desirable to do so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagens are a group of proteins that provide structural support and mechanical strength to the gel-like extracellular matrix in skin, cartilage and other body tissues. There are various types, each comprising long chains of amino acids that wind together to form strong fibres called fibrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Viewed under an electron microscope, these fibrils form a basket-like mesh in young, healthy skin. But as we age, the amount of collagen declines and its structure becomes more cross-linked and fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In younger skin, the fibres tend to be longer and more flexible, but in older skin, they’re shorter and more rigid, primarily as a result of UV damage,” said Prof John Connelly, who studies skin repair and regeneration at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagen is not the only protein that keeps skin looking youthful. Elastin allows skin to stretch and spring back, while other structural proteins help to organise and stabilise collagen. Long sugar chains known as glycosaminoglycans – including the popular skincare ingredient hyaluronic acid – play a key role in hydrating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the tissue. Like collagen, these components degrade and change with age, contributing to sagging, reduced plumpness and wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet collagen continues to dominate the spotlight. Many skincare products list it as an ingredient but “these proteins are very large, so they don’t easily cross the skin barrier when applied topically”, said &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/tanya-shaw" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Prof Tanya Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation and expert in wound healing at King’s College London. That said, collagen in creams may help draw moisture to the skin’s surface, providing a temporary plumping effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagen drinks are the latest plot twist. Their aim is to supply the raw materials for fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for collagen production. There was also evidence that fragments of extracellular matrix proteins might act as signals, stimulating fibroblasts to produce not just collagen but also elastin and hyaluronic acid, said Dr Jonathan Kentley, a consultant dermatologist at the Montrose clinic in London and Chelsea and Westminster hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most collagen supplements use fragments derived from chicken, fish or pork, which are absorbed through the gut and transported to the skin via the bloodstream. However, many are probably broken down further during digestion and it is unclear whether other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dietary proteins would offer similar building blocks, according to Connelly and Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even if some fragments do reach the skin, they would be working in a damaged environment. “If you start to make new collagen, where does it go, and how does it interact with the existing collagen?” said &lt;a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.sherratt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Mike Sherratt&lt;/a&gt;, a skin mechanics expert at the University of Manchester. Also, “if it gets into the bloodstream, it’s not only going to affect the skin, but presumably other organs and tissues as well”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Animal studies offer some support for collagen supplements: radio-labelled collagen fragments have been shown to reach the skin and boost gene activity linked to collagen production in mice. “Mouse studies have also shown reduced wrinkle formation following UV exposure,” said Kentley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some human trials have also reported improved hydration, elasticity, and fewer wrinkles after consuming fish collagen. But most of these were industry-funded and a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325002839#sec0015" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 23 studies found that only those receiving funding from companies showed significant effects. Kentley said: “When the studies were separated into high-quality and low-quality studies, the high-quality studies showed no skin benefits. So, these results must be interpreted with extreme caution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What about medical procedures such as NeoGen? It uses high-frequency radio waves to covert nitrogen gas into plasma (ionised gas), which delivers controlled heat to deeper layers of the skin. Animal studies suggest this controlled thermal damage alters collagen structure, causing skin tightening, and promotes the shedding of surface layers, improving tone and texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Small clinical studies on patients have also shown an improvement in skin tone and wrinkling,” said Kentley. “However, as this is a relatively new technology there is relatively little evidence other than a handful of small studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other procedures such as microneedling also induce tiny, controlled injuries to the skin, triggering a wound healing response, while injectable “biostimulators” – such as Sculptra – create a foreign body response that stimulates fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While all these procedures have some clinical evidence supporting their ability to stimulate new collagen, the quality is variable and no head-to-head trials have pitted these products and procedures against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kentley said: “Given that aesthetic medicine is so highly personalised and each product or procedure will have its own benefits and risks, the best way to know what is right for you is by seeing a qualified physician who is not conflicted by the quest for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In terms of topical treatments, there are decades of evidence to support the use of tretinoin [a prescription-strength retinoid] to boost collagen production and reduce other signs of skin ageing such as pigmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although celebrity endorsements and dramatic before-and-after pictures can be persuasive, it is also worth remembering that these procedures are not a permanent fix for skin ageing – they require continuing treatments, which can be costly. The most effective long-term strategy to protect and preserve your collagen is to minimise UV exposure from an early age, through consistent use of sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sherratt showed me a photo of him during &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/19/britain-heatwave-1976-crisis-summer-heat" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Britain’s 1976 heatwave&lt;/a&gt;, when he was nine. Unlike the proteins inside our cells that are regularly renewed, he said, type I collagen in the dermis had a half-life of about 15 years and elastin was thought to be meant to last a lifetime. “These proteins accumulate damage over time. So, it’s highly likely that some of the extracellular matrix proteins in my face and forearm still carry damage from that 1976 holiday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For those of us who did not faithfully apply sunscreen in our youth, it is worth being realistic about how much even the most advanced treatments can achieve. While they may temporarily firm and smooth the skin, the deeper biological damage has already taken place – and much of it may be irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOW1IVnhUN2s2emFOQnRPQnZMdWxZblhwTlN3VUtjTzlJNUVjQzVYRmkwTng5cG1WUzBMMWJxaVhob216b1hidTVSNE9Wel9KRW5xMGVFbVNLLXpXbGZKVG1lenFnYW5CLWk1SDF4cDE4OGJtNkcyYW5uZUloM2xJRDBzZlF4dnVWOGZ4NEVva3QzTzZ4ZnRtUjVPeVpTaW50T0VxTWxn</guid></item><item><title>湾区新冠肺炎疫情水平目前高于冬季高峰-伯克利赛德 | Bay Area COVID levels now higher than winter peak - Berkeleyside</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOQVd2aUJoZkxRclBPTUw2bWZtRjJFSHFWNHEweFpZd281NHY5M0tvS0VwaXNlTzFRT3BWNlhYQlNMbzdWZ3hmc2FiTW5VaFhQd0Roa0RZTFB4VUxKSHNOR1QtM3Z4Mm1QUnhFczIxRFRyQjR6WHE4NzZMcGNSUFdBellKeXNjcFFta1FpcjdDOW1vZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it feels like several people you know are complaining of &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11954507/covid-symptoms-after-pride-how-to-find-test"&gt;feeling sick with what they assume is an “awful summer cold” — perhaps with a painful sore throat — &lt;/a&gt;there’s a good chance it could be COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 levels in Bay Area wastewater have now exceeded the winter peak, according to Stanford’s WastewaterSCAN team, which monitors coronavirus presence in human sewage. This also means Bay Area COVID-19 levels are rising faster than the statewide average. While coronavirus presence has increased 55% in California over the past three weeks, according to &lt;a href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/"&gt;the California Department of Public Health’s wastewater tracking&lt;/a&gt;, those statewide numbers haven’t surpassed winter highs — as like they have in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise is fueled in part by a new subvariant called NB.1.8.1, dubbed “Nimbus.” People who’ve been infected with this strain have also reported suffering a particularly nasty sore throat among their symptoms, earning this latest strain the unpleasant nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, what do you need to know about the symptoms of NB.1.8.1? What’s the COVID-19 incubation period in 2025, how long should you isolate and where can you still find a free COVID-19 test? And if you’re unfortunate enough to suffer “razor blade throat,” what can you do to ease your symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep reading for everything you need to know about the new Nimbus variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-nb-1-8-1-and-is-it-worse-than-previous-variants"&gt;What is NB.1.8.1, and is it worse than previous variants?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Nimbus is the most prevalent COVID-19 subvariant in the United States, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt; estimates currently makes up 43% of cases nationwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus is absolutely more transmissible — that is, more contagious and more easily caught — than previous variants, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UCSF. That’s how a new variant ends up beating its siblings and “rising to the top of the charts,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s “no evidence that it causes more serious disease,” Chin-Hong said, echoing &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;the World Health Organization’s May briefing designating Nimbus a “variant under monitoring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite this, NB.1.8.1 &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; still cause more people to go to the hospital with COVID-19, he said, “because if it’s fueling more people getting it, some of those people are going to be more vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-the-new-nimbus-covid19-variant"&gt;What are the symptoms of the new Nimbus COVID-19 variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong confirmed that no surprising wild card symptoms have yet been reported for NB.1.8.1 — they’re the same COVID-19 symptoms you’re used to hearing about from previous variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the one symptom that doctors are hearing about from patients is the very painful throat that’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;earned the unfortunate nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/a&gt; Or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/1ldvned/new_razor_blade_throat_covid_subvariant_quickly/"&gt;as Reddit commenters have described it&lt;/a&gt;, “like being burned by acid whenever I ate or drank something” and “like my throat was coated in broken glass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is Nimbus, a descendant of the omicron variant that first emerged in 2021, causing such sore throats? “I think omicron in general prioritizes the upper respiratory tract instead of the getting into the lungs as much,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989396/"&gt;One 2022 study from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; found that a higher proportion of patients — up to 70% of those studied — reported sore throats when infected with the omicron variant compared with earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with previous variants to reach the Bay Area, Chin-Hong noted that more people also now appear to experience non-respiratory symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting when they get COVID-19 — gastrointestinal symptoms that folks can often initially dismiss as being unrelated to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/"&gt;this is the full list of the possible symptoms of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;New loss of taste or smell&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Congestion or runny nose&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you might have a combination of these symptoms or just one. They might be mild or feel more severe. But if you’re experiencing any of these, take a COVID-19 test (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ok-so-how-can-i-soothe-my-razor-blade-throat-if-im-infected"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, so how can I soothe my ‘razor blade throat’ if I’m infected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of severe sore throat, it might be tempting to focus on topical medicine for your throat itself. But in general, systemic therapies — treatments which enter through your bloodstream, like Advil, and affect your whole body — “are better than topical ones,” Chin-Hong said. His recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen (like Advil) is better than acetaminophen (like Tylenol) in this case, he said, although you should check with your health provider if you have other medical conditions which might make taking ibuprofen unsafe. If your throat hurts too much to swallow a pill, you can consider liquid versions of these drugs, but make sure you use the right dose depending on age, Chin-Hong said. And if you’re using a combination cold remedy like Nyquil, be aware it might already contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen — and be careful not to accidentally double-dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic remedies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try warm remedies like chicken soup, broth, lemon tea, honey or cold ones like popsicles, ice cream or ice chips. The upside of these treatments is the immediate relief they can bring, but they might also not last as long. You could also try gargling salt water, “which may loosen mucus” Chin-Hong said, or sucking lozenges with menthol or a mild anesthetic like benzocaine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental treatments to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong also recommends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Get your rest&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Don’t smoke or expose yourself to smoke&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider a humidifier, as dryness may make your symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you should consider seeking medical attention if your symptoms last longer than a week, if your sore throat is very severe, and if you begin drooling or become unable to eat or drink, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-current-covid19-cases-in-the-bay-area-right-now"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the current COVID-19 cases in the Bay Area right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual “COVID cases” — that is positive test results — are no longer tracked as closely by local and state public health bodies. In the absence of widespread up-to-date data on positive test results, monitoring the presence of the coronavirus in human sewage has become an increasingly important way to gauge the levels of COVID-19 spread in a particular area. This is because if you have COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1963120/one-way-to-monitor-a-communitys-coronavirus-infections-raw-sewage"&gt;the virus will show up in your feces &lt;/a&gt;soon after you’re infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent increases in COVID-19 levels in the Bay Area’s wastewater, “average concentrations are still lower than this time last year” when &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11987343/covid-bay-area-wastewater-variant-symptoms-isolation-guidance"&gt;the Bay Area experienced a summer surge, &lt;/a&gt;said Amanda Bidwell from Stanford’s WastewaterSCAN team. However, the Bay Area’s wastewater sites monitored by Stanford are currently in the “high” category, she told KQED on Monday, with a “statistically significant upward trend” in the last three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the COVID-19 levels in your &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CkUQACABSABSBjVhYTY5OVIGMDJkMjQyUgZkZDM2ZmJSBjY3YzJlYlIGMjkzYjI1WgZOIEdlbmV40gGKAQY1OTRlYzPAAQE%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=594ec3"&gt;Alameda County’s wastewater&lt;/a&gt; according to WastewaterSCAN’s monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-latest-covid19-vaccine-still-effective-against-the-new-variant"&gt;Is the latest COVID-19 vaccine still effective against the new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine that rolled out in August 2024 &lt;/a&gt;is effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant, Chin-Hong said. “It’s a descendant of JN.1, which all the last year’s vaccines were based on, which we still have around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;get your COVID-19 shot in the fall, Chin-Hong has a message&lt;/a&gt;: Go get one now, particularly if you plan to travel abroad this summer. Not only will your protection last roughly a year, he said, “getting it now if it’s being paid for would help that person navigate through what we might see in the summer, but also later on in the year if rules change” — referring to the widespread uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;how President Donald Trump’s administration might further change the U.S.’s vaccine policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;Currently, the CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for most adults 18 and older&lt;/a&gt;, which means that most health insurance companies should cover the costs for people with insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="i-think-i-was-exposed-or-have-symptoms-when-should-i-take-a-covid19-test"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I think I was exposed or have symptoms. When should I take a COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Know about updated incubation times for NB.1.8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard that incubation times for the virus are getting shorter — that is, the amount of time between getting exposed to COVID-19 and testing positive — it’s true. People are testing positive more quickly than they were in 2020, when the average incubation period was five to seven days, because it has changed with each new variant, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days is a common period of time between exposure and getting sick, Chin-Hong said, and given this trend, it makes sense to take a COVID-19 test as early as two days after exposure if you’re already having symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Don’t trust a negative early COVID-19 test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your first test is negative, you should absolutely test again the next day if symptoms persist — and again after that if you’re still negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why you can’t necessarily trust a negative at-home COVID-19 test in 2025: While incubation times have gotten shorter, doctors are seeing people take longer to get a positive test, Chin-Hong said, and that’s probably more to do with how much quicker someone with COVID-19 might develop &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; in 2025 than they would have done in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, those symptoms are the sign that your body’s immune system is mounting a response to an invading virus. Back at the start of the pandemic, by the time you developed COVID-19 symptoms and took a test, it would probably already be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at this stage of the pandemic, “we likely have more immune cells circulating that can recognize the enemy, so it ‘sounds the alarm’ quicker [and] people might feel something faster than in the old days,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University, also put it this way for NPR in 2024: “With our immune systems primed, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/07/1222847727/coronavirus-faq-my-partner-roommate-kid-got-covid-and-i-didnt-how-come"&gt;the body’s response [now] comes much more quickly than it would have back in 2020&lt;/a&gt; when SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because many of us take a COVID-19 test when we &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to feel sick, we might actually be testing way too early for an at-home antigen kit to successfully detect enough virus inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: If you’re testing because you’ve started feeling unwell, don’t assume a negative result means you don’t actually have COVID-19. Play it safe, stay home as much as you can and wear a well-fitted mask if you can’t. Take another antigen test 48 hours later, Chin-Hong said. You can also seek out a PCR test, which is more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Make sure your COVID-19 test hasn’t expired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those COVID-19 tests you might have in a drawer may be approaching their expiration date if they haven’t already passed it. And an expired test could give you an unreliable result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;You can check the FDA’s list of antigen test types &lt;/a&gt;to see &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;whether the box you’re holding has had its shelf life extended&lt;/a&gt; by the manufacturer. The FDA said that if a test’s shelf life has been extended, it’s because the manufacturer has given the agency enough “data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized.” (In other words, it’s still OK to use that test.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tip from Chin-Hong: “A quick and dirty way” to know if you’re using a functional COVID-19 test is to make sure the control line turns positive. If that doesn’t happen, “that means the test is probably not working,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-i-test-positive-how-long-do-i-have-do-isolate-with-covid19-in-2025"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If I test positive, how long do I have do isolate with COVID-19 in 2025?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, the CDC officially revised their national COVID-19 isolation guidance, saying that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html"&gt;COVID-positive people could now return to work or regular activities&lt;/a&gt; once “symptoms are improving overall” and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html"&gt;they’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; without use of a fever-reducing medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11973108/how-long-to-isolate-with-covid-in-2024-california-now-says-that-depends-on-symptoms"&gt;Read more about current isolation guidance for COVID-19.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been infected, consider asking your health provider for the COVID-19 medication &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11914514/if-you-get-covid-should-you-try-to-get-paxlovid-heres-how-with-or-without-health-insurance"&gt;Paxlovid, an antiviral treatment in pill form that is still available free by prescription in California. &lt;/a&gt;Read more on &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11914514/if-you-get-covid-should-you-try-to-get-paxlovid-heres-how-with-or-without-health-insurance"&gt;requesting a prescription for Paxlovid, with or without health insurance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-can-inbspstillnbspfind-a-free-covid19-test"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where can I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find a free COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a quick, free COVID-19 test — whether an at-home antigen test or a PCR test — has gotten progressively harder at this stage of the pandemic as more sites and services have been shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And visiting &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;the White House site that once offered you free at-home COVID-tests&lt;/a&gt; through USPS will now greet you with an image of Trump superimposed over the headline “LAB LEAK: The True Origins of COVID-19,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/18/g-s1-61324/lab-leak-white-house-covid-origins"&gt;a page dedicated to the theory disputed by many scientists&lt;/a&gt; that the pandemic was caused by the coronavirus leaking from a government laboratory in Wuhan, China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do now if you don’t already have a supply of antigen tests for COVID-19 at home right now? Try the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="purchase-a-covid19-athome-antigen-test-at-a-pharmacy-near-you"&gt;Purchase a COVID-19 at-home antigen test at a pharmacy near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest option will also be one of the most expensive up-front: Purchasing an at-home antigen test at a nearby pharmacy. (Ideally, ask someone to purchase one for you so you don’t potentially expose other people at the pharmacy, and if you really have to go yourself, wear a well-fitted N95 mask to help lower the risk you pose to others.) These at-home test kits are usually around $20 for a pack of two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you can &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11969300/how-to-get-reimbursed-for-at-home-covid-tests-in-2023"&gt;request reimbursement from your health insurer for the cost of up to eight at-home tests per month&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t throw away your receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="find-a-covid19-pcr-testing-site-near-you"&gt;Find a COVID-19 PCR testing site near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR testing is more accurate than an antigen test. It’s more sensitive at picking up traces of the coronavirus in your body, but it may take longer to get your results than with an at-home test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are still some sites offering free COVID-19 testing around the state. Try visiting &lt;a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/testing.html"&gt;MyTurn.ca.gov/testing&lt;/a&gt; and applying the “Free Sites” filter from the drop-down menu. You can also find&lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"&gt; a health center near you &lt;/a&gt;and ask if they offer COVID-19 testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://testinglocator.cdc.gov/Search"&gt;The CDC’s COVID-19 test locator&lt;/a&gt; is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you may be able to get a PCR test ordered by your health care provider with the costs covered. Having a test ordered by a provider is — usually — the only way to get your testing costs covered if you have Medicare, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re insured through major Bay Area providers like Kaiser Permanente or Sutter Health, the easiest way to get a COVID-19 test may be to make an appointment through your provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most providers offer sign-ups online through a member login and appointments can also be made by phone.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether poached, scrambled, or sunny side up, eggs have remained a breakfast staple around the globe. Yet, for decades, they’ve also been the subject of dietary controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health professionals once warned us to limit our egg intake due to cholesterol concerns. They feared that too many eggs might clog arteries and increase the risk of heart disease. But as science continues to evolve, so do our ideas about food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; now challenges these long-standing beliefs. The research offers clear evidence that eggs may not deserve their bad reputation. Instead, they could be an unexpected ally in maintaining heart &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; if eaten the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-were-blamed-for-heart-problems"&gt;Eggs were blamed for heart problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings arrive at a crucial time. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death across the globe. Nearly 18 million people die from CVD each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, one person dies every 12 minutes due to CVD. That is one in four lives lost to heart-related issues. With such staggering statistics, it is essential to understand what truly contributes to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, experts assumed cholesterol-rich foods like eggs played a direct role in raising LDL cholesterol, often called “bad cholesterol.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This assumption led to dietary guidelines that limited egg consumption. But Professor Jon Buckley and his research team wanted to look closer. They suspected that the real story was more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs have long been unfairly cracked by outdated dietary advice,” Professor Buckley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-don-t-raise-bad-cholesterol"&gt;Eggs don’t raise bad cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what’s being called a world-first study, UniSA researchers set out to separate myth from fact. They explored how dietary cholesterol and saturated fat independently affect LDL cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team designed a controlled diet study where participants consumed two eggs daily. The key twist? The overall &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-power-of-fish-oil-in-combating-high-cholesterol/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; was high in cholesterol but low in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising. Eating two eggs a day, within a low saturated fat diet, actually reduced LDL cholesterol levels. That means the cholesterol in eggs did not raise the risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, when saturated fat intake stayed low, dietary cholesterol from eggs had little to no negative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we separated the effects of cholesterol and saturated fat, finding that high dietary cholesterol from eggs, when eaten as part of a low saturated fat diet, does not raise bad cholesterol levels,” Buckley explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-culprit-emerges"&gt;A new culprit emerges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if not eggs, what’s really behind elevated cholesterol &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/good-cholesterol-may-increase-the-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;? The answer lies in saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in processed meats, fatty cuts of red meat, full-fat dairy products, and many baked goods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people eat these foods regularly, LDL cholesterol levels can rise, increasing the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley and his team highlight that eggs, although rich in cholesterol, contain very little saturated fat. This balance makes them quite different from other animal-based foods. It also means that we need to reevaluate which foods are the true culprits in heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, it was the saturated fat that was the real driver of cholesterol elevation,” Buckley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-are-fine-but-fatty-sides-are-not"&gt;Eggs are fine, but fatty sides are not&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study changes how we might think about the classic cooked breakfast. It is not the eggs on your plate that should raise &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-salmon-can-help-lower-your-cholesterol/"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt;. It is what you pair them with. Greasy bacon, processed sausages, and buttered toast may be the real threat to your heart, not the eggs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could say we’ve delivered hard-boiled evidence in defence of the humble egg,” noted Buckley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you are standing in front of a sizzling pan, think carefully. Eggs can remain on the menu. But you might want to skip that second sausage link or the extra slice of fried bread. The study reminds us that balance is more important than banishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-in-a-cholesterol-friendly-diet"&gt;Eggs in a cholesterol-friendly diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are not only versatile but also packed with essential nutrients. They contain high-quality protein, vitamins like B12 and D, and healthy fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people trying to maintain a balanced diet, eggs can offer both nourishment and convenience. The new research finally gives them a fair chance to shine without guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, when it comes to a cooked breakfast, it’s not the eggs you need to worry about – it’s the extra serve of bacon or the side of sausage that’s more likely to impact your heart health,” said Buckley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to let go of outdated advice. Science has turned the tables on cholesterol myths, allowing eggs to reclaim their place on the breakfast table. When part of a low saturated fat diet, eggs do not just taste good, they might actually support your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002539?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:51:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQTkpuMUlUWUlLSEp6SUJFR25HdGdwQ3oyQmNaZ2xqV09yd1FOWElxcmUxcWVyaVd0RndrUUhIZzFBbkVJenRxaTVPb2NWSGcxSndYbXJvT3JBa0ZsZlNCRW12WTFIM21nX1Y2dVdMd2xmRk5CY0hqbGJ2ZGItM1JBU2VsYw</guid></item><item><title>为什么美国人燃烧的卡路里比以往任何时候都多，但体重却不断增加-研究发现 | Why Americans Keep Gaining Weight Despite Burning More Calories Than Ever - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNM25MZjRSOExkYnM5V01MVTZxbm1SSUVqOUtYOFVJbjdHWl8yTmY3bll3R1d5VlltWGt3OGh4WGIzczIwZE9rZE5fN05KbE1xV2ZHRkxiaE9aNnhKa0JYSFczNUhBOXBtZDc2TU5PR2c5MkVwSVM2b3hUS0d0Mm9oWUZWS05mcE1ZNHVodmFyMTNPQndZYUhkY25uSGJKZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A global study of 4,213 adults finds that people in wealthier countries actually burn &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; daily calories than those in traditional lifestyles.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity in developed nations is not driven by inactivity but by increased intake, especially of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Physical activity levels did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; significantly decline with economic development, challenging common obesity assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The percentage of ultra-processed food in the diet was strongly linked to higher body fat, suggesting food quality—not movement—is the key issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DURHAM, N.C. —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans burn more calories daily than people living traditional lifestyles in developing countries. Yet we’re also significantly fatter. How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Duke University study of 4,213 people spanning 34 populations worldwide — from Tanzanian hunter-gatherers to Norwegian office workers — shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/weight-gain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;expanding waistlines&lt;/a&gt; have little to do with becoming less active. What we eat, not how much we move, is the real driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that “daily energy expenditures are greater in developed populations, and activity energy expenditures are not reduced in more industrialized populations.” This directly challenges the common assumption that declining physical activity is the main cause of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors write in the study’s significance section, these results “suggest that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dietary intake &lt;/a&gt;plays a far greater role than reduced expenditure in the elevated prevalence of obesity associated with economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developed-countries-actually-burn-more-daily-calories"&gt;Developed Countries Actually Burn More Daily Calories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure how many calories people actually burn each day, the researchers used a technique called “doubly labeled water,” which tracks how quickly the body processes certain harmless isotopes over 7 to 14 days. It’s considered the most accurate method available for measuring total energy expenditure in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the study found that people in more economically developed countries &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fitness-trackers-fitbit-calories-inaccurate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burned more&lt;/a&gt; calories per day than those in less developed ones. This wasn’t just because they were taller or heavier, though body size did explain part of the difference. Even after adjusting for weight and muscle mass, the difference in calories burned was modest, only about 6%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also expected to see lower &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/effects-sitting-offset-by-30-minutes-exercise/"&gt;physical activity levels&lt;/a&gt; in wealthier nations, but that wasn’t the case. Across all 34 populations studied, people in industrialized societies were just as physically active as those in traditional or rural settings. There was “no significant change” in physical activity levels with economic development, meaning people across different lifestyles generally moved their bodies just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ultra-processed-foods-drive-weight-gain"&gt;How Ultra-Processed Foods Drive Weight Gain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real difference between countries wasn’t how much people moved. It was what they ate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the 25 populations where dietary data were available, one trend stood out clearly: the more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ultra-processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; people consumed, the more body fat they tended to carry. These foods — like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;, packaged snacks, and ready-to-eat meals — are industrially made and often contain long lists of ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, one likely explanation is that these foods are easier to digest, which means the body absorbs more calories from them. Less energy is lost during digestion, and more gets stored. Some studies suggest these foods may also interfere with the body’s hunger signals, causing people to eat more than they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though people in wealthier countries were burning more calories, they were also eating more; and not just more food overall, but more food that seems to encourage &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fat-around-muscles-deadlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fat storage&lt;/a&gt;. Because participants in the study maintained a stable weight during the measurement period, the researchers were able to infer that calorie intake must have closely matched calorie expenditure at the time. That means the high calorie burn in developed countries is matched by equally high consumption, likely driven by food quality rather than quantity alone&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-fighting-obesity"&gt;What This Means for Fighting Obesity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that physical activity is still vital for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;. It lowers the risk of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, improves &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;, and helps maintain a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. But when it comes specifically to obesity, the biggest factor appears to be the kind of food people eat, not how much they move.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also found that much of the increase in body mass in wealthier countries came from muscle and lean tissue, not just fat. In other words, better access to nutrition helps support healthy growth, even as it contributes to weight gain. Still, body fat increased more than &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to a mismatch between calorie intake and the body’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What stood out most was this: the differences in body fat between rich and poor countries were about 10 times greater than any differences linked to how many calories people burned. That’s a powerful argument for focusing on the food environment — what’s available, affordable, and marketed to people — rather than just telling individuals to exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, public health campaigns have leaned on the slogan “eat less, move more.” This study suggests it’s time to shift focus. The root of the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; may not be laziness, but the global rise of ultra-processed foods that are cheap, convenient, and engineered to be overeaten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This study is observational and cross-sectional, meaning it cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships. While the data strongly support associations between economic development, ultra-processed food consumption, and obesity, the authors note that more research is needed to clarify the underlying physiological and environmental mechanisms. Additionally, dietary data were only available for a subset of populations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 4,213 adults aged 18–60 across 34 populations representing different levels of economic development, from hunter-gatherers to industrialized societies. They used the doubly labeled water method, considered the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure, which tracks isotope depletion in body water over 7–14 days to calculate total daily calories burned. Body composition was measured using deuterium dilution to determine fat-free mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage. Economic development was categorized using the UN Human Development Index, which incorporates measures of wealth, education, and life expectancy. The study also examined dietary data from 25 populations, including the percentage of ultra-processed foods in people’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Body fat percentage and obesity rates increased significantly with economic development across all populations studied. However, total daily energy expenditure was actually higher in more developed countries, primarily due to larger body sizes. When adjusted for body size, energy expenditure decreased only modestly (6–11%) with development, and this small difference could explain only about one-tenth of the obesity differences between populations. Surprisingly, physical activity energy expenditure showed no significant decline with economic development. Among populations with dietary data, the percentage of ultra-processed foods in the diet was positively correlated with body fat percentage, demonstrating that dietary intake rather than reduced energy expenditure drives obesity in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used cross-sectional data, making it impossible to establish causality in the relationships between economic development, diet, and obesity. Detailed dietary information was available for only 25 of the 34 populations studied. The research could not identify specific environmental, social, or physiological factors that promote increased calorie intake and absorption in developed settings. Some energy expenditure measurements used estimated rather than directly measured basal metabolic rates. The study also couldn’t resolve whether differences in food quality, quantity, digestibility, or other factors drive the dietary effects observed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by multiple funding sources including the US National Science Foundation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, International Atomic Energy Agency, and various other research institutions. The Doubly Labeled Water Database used in the research is supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The authors declared no competing financial interests that could bias the research findings.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;, the rare illness has been confirmed by the state's health officials, and they report that another seven people remain ill as of the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria, which are found in &lt;a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/food/woman-loses-limbs-tilapia"&gt;raw or undercooked seafood&lt;/a&gt;, saltwater, and brackish water, are naturally occurring and can be found in warm coastal waters where rivers and lakes meet seawater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kYQaHc fRpdaK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, people become infected with the illness when the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ingest the water&lt;/a&gt; or else get it into an open wound, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-flUlJl eUedHw sc-irKEWy LvovW"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eXuzZk jBEPVW"&gt;Article continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-iGkqGz yErDY lngtd-dynamic-inarticle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eXuzZk jBEPVW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 data-header="true" class="sc-xGAYn kHWHfb"&gt;Where is the flesh-eating bacteria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-percent="50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kYQaHc fRpdaK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that people who are living and working in the state would want to know where the bacteria is coming from so that they can avoid it. However, it doesn't look like officials are ready, or able, to make that information public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we do know that the illnesses were reported in four different Florida counties, including St. Johns, Hillsborough, Broward, and Bay counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-flUlJl eUedHw sc-irKEWy LvovW"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eXuzZk jBEPVW"&gt;Article continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-iGkqGz yErDY lngtd-dynamic-inarticle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eXuzZk jBEPVW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-header="true" class="sc-xGAYn kHWHfb"&gt;This type of flesh-eating bacteria is considered rare.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kYQaHc fRpdaK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, these types of infections aren't common. Just 80,000 people a year will get infected with vibrio, and only 100 people a year will die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put that in perspective, E. coli infections — which is the bacteria that most commonly &lt;a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/e-coli/urinary-tract-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;causes urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt; — occur at a rate of approximately 150 million cases a year, according to Everyday Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-percent="75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="sc-flUlJl eUedHw sc-irKEWy LvovW"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eXuzZk jBEPVW"&gt;Article continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-iGkqGz yErDY lngtd-dynamic-inarticle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eXuzZk jBEPVW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kYQaHc fRpdaK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean that this is Florida's first brush with it. According to &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;, there were 82 cases of the bacteria found in 2024. Of those cases, 19 people lost their lives as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publication credits the spike in cases and deaths to the back-to-back hurricanes that hit the state in October, which included Helene and Milton. It sounds like the brackish water where the bacteria thrives flooded much of the state, exposing more people to it in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kYQaHc fRpdaK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Florida's Department of Health isn't offering up too much information about the illness, they are telling anyone who is immunocompromised to &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;wear foot protection&lt;/a&gt; while walking on the beach so they can avoid injuries caused by sharp objects like shells and rocks, which could give the bacteria an easier way to get into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Green Matters</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5LYXBrc2E1SUxnbG9xd0pkaEt2c0hydlQ1NDRvOF9EU241ZjI4UWZoTl9YRm9MUmxndFBEY3hyNGhLNF9DY1U3N2d0eUZUS2FtQ1d2RVlIRmJZdFdxOUdyVjc0LU03bVU3Tm0tQU9jemhwbzUwUTFB</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，这是每个人为了更好的心脏健康都应该吃的一种蔬菜-非常简单 | A Cardiologist Says This Is the One Vegetable Everyone Should Eat for Better Heart Health - Real Simple</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQMkJWbmZTc3RyaFlNa01TQVlKZlZhNFYxcDFHcVgycmgxaHlLZzhBblF1T3hkdHEwanhic1FYUFVtZGZLZmtvaXZDUW41N0JleVFOU2Z0dFpWQ1habVFaVkRia3VHampNSFBEZ2dWQVZZSUtRSEJEVXdTUl9KWF9sNW16anF5OEVWdkYtRzdnVmlqRDRvaUsxR05kNVBlMEpUM0lybWhSZGM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="realsimple-sc-page_1-0" class="comp realsimple-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-callout--summary realsimple-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, potassium, and antioxidants, avocado supports heart health by lowering LDL cholesterol, reducing blood pressure, and fighting inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado's soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract, helping the body remove it naturally and further reducing heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Versatile and mild in flavor, avocado can be easily added to salads, sandwiches, smoothies, and dressings to boost your daily intake of heart-friendly nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a diet rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-many-servings-of-fruits-and-vegetables-per-day-8421337" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best things you can do for your heart. That’s because these foods are high in heart-healthy nutrients, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-fiber-than-beans-11770159" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, minerals, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also naturally low in saturated (“bad”) fats and sodium, which can have negative effects on the heart. However, there’s one vegetable that’s particularly beneficial for cardiac health, and it’s more impressive than you may think. Read on to learn a cardiologist’s pick for the best vegetable for heart health, along with ways to eat it at home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-best-vegetable-for-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Best Vegetable for Heart Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, cardiologist and director of Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School at Tufts University, one vegetable wins in the realm of cardiac health: &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/avocado-nutrition" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;em&gt;technically &lt;/em&gt;a fruit, avocado is commonly eaten and prepared like a vegetable, and it’s highly beneficial for your heart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-callout--meetourexpert mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--meetourexpert mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-meetourexpert callout--bordered" data-text="Meet the Expert" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/dariush-mozaffarian" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dariush Mozaffarian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, DrPH, cardiologist and director of Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School at Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is partly due to its rich content of unsaturated fatty acids, or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;“good” fats&lt;/a&gt;. “Unsaturated fats come in two major classes, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated,” explains Dr. Mozaffarian. Both types can help manage blood cholesterol levels, a key component of healthy heart function. According to Dr. Mozaffarian avocados contain mostly monounsaturated fatty acids, which help decrease LDL (“bad”) cholesterol&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This is a noteworthy effect, as high LDL cholesterol levels can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, per the experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado also provides &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;; just half an avocado satisfies 20 percent of your daily fiber needs&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This includes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/soluble-fiber-vs-insoluble-fiber" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which binds to cholesterol in the intestine and removes it from the body via stool&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. This reduces cholesterol absorption in the body, thereby supporting healthy blood cholesterol levels and lowering the risk of heart disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, avocado contains &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, an essential mineral for heart health. “Potassium lowers blood pressure and helps offset the harms of sodium,” shares Dr. Mozaffarian. (ICYDK, excess sodium can increase blood pressure, or the force of blood flow against your artery walls.) This can help manage or prevent high blood pressure, or hypertension, another risk factor of cardiovascular disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To top it off, avocado is teeming with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/fruits-with-more-antioxidants-than-green-tea-11739371" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. These beneficial compounds fight oxidative stress and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, two factors that also contribute to heart disease. Antioxidants also prevent LDL cholesterol from oxidizing&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a process that would otherwise promote plaque buildup in arteries, causing atherosclerosis&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If such buildup occurs, it can prevent proper blood flow and lead to heart issues like heart attack and stroke—but antioxidants, like those in avocado, may help reduce the risk.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As important as our brains are, it’s all too easy to overlook the everyday habits that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quietly undermine brain health&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these are so common that we barely notice them. But over time, they can chip away at your cognitive strength, dull your focus and leave you more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-conditions-that-may-increase-your-risk-for-cognitive-decline-8756345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vulnerable to mental decline&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, we spoke with neuroscientist &lt;a href="http://www.manifestwellness.co" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamey Maniscalco, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;, to find out which of these habits to look out for. Here are the top six under-the-radar habits he says could be harming your brain health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-missing-out-on-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Missing Out on Sleep  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We all know that sleep is important, but many of us don’t recognize that it’s absolutely vital for brain health,” says Maniscalco. “Sleep isn’t just rest. It’s a highly active process during which your brain performs critical housekeeping, emotional processing and memory consolidation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sleep is also when your brain purges itself of harmful waste products that build up during your waking hours.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic sleep deprivation may even raise the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909431/have-a-family-history-of-dementia-or-alzheimers-heres-how-to-protect-your-brain-as-you-age/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. One suspected reason is that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; disrupts the brain’s ability to clear out beta-amyloid, a toxic protein that builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one study that followed nearly 8,000 people for more than 25 years found that those who routinely slept six hours or less per night during their 50s, 60s and 70s were significantly more likely to develop dementia than those who logged seven hours of sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To protect your brain health, prioritize seven to nine hours of consistent sleep nightly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-smoking"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Smoking  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Smoking isn’t just damaging to the heart and lungs; it can also have serious, often overlooked consequences for brain health,” says Maniscalco. “Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals, many of which cross the blood-brain barrier and contribute directly to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in brain tissue.” Over time, this may accelerate the breakdown of neurons and their supporting structures, which can lead to measurable changes in the brain’s structure and function.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That may be why research has found a strong correlation between smoking and an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to the American Heart Association, smoking can raise the risk of dementia by 30%, and it can boost the odds of Alzheimer’s disease by 40%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, quitting smoking can reduce this risk substantially. Support programs, nicotine replacement therapies and professional counseling are excellent resources to help you kick the habit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-drinking-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Drinking Alcohol  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking alcohol, even in small amounts, may harm your brain’s structure and health. One study of more than 36,000 middle-aged and older adults found that regular alcohol consumption was linked to reduced brain volume, loss of gray matter and damage to white matter. This may impair communication within the brain. Surprisingly, declines in grey and white matter volume were noticeable even in people who drank as little as one alcoholic drink a day. And the more alcohol a person drank, the more harmful its effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes alcohol so problematic? “Alcohol is both a central nervous system depressant and a neurotoxin,” says Maniscalco. “This means it slows down brain activity by dampening communication between neurons and, at higher levels or with chronic use, it can damage or even kill brain cells.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re not saying that you need to give up alcohol entirely. But if you do drink, try to stick with the recommended guidelines of no more than one drink per day for women and two for men. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-skimping-on-healthy-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Skimping on Healthy Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your brain is one of the most metabolically active organs in the body. It uses over 20% of your daily energy intake despite making up just about 2% of your body weight,” says Maniscalco. “That means what you eat doesn’t just affect your body composition, it directly impacts your ability to regulate your mood, memory, focus and even emotional resilience.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feeding your brain a wide variety of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; may help it function at its best. The link between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911108/best-and-worst-foods-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutrition and brain health&lt;/a&gt; is so strong that research has found that an eating pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and fish may promote greater brain volume and protect against cognitive decline. Conversely, people whose diets are highest in ultra-processed foods may experience cognitive decline considerably sooner than people who rarely eat these foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-doing-the-same-thing-all-the-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Doing the Same Thing All the Time &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The brain craves novelty. It’s wired to respond to new experiences, challenges and learning opportunities, since these inputs stimulate growth, adaptation to new environments and long-term resilience,” says Maniscalco. “Without regular exposure to novelty, we risk falling into patterns of mental autopilot, where the brain’s most dynamic systems that are responsible for attention, problem-solving, memory and creativity go underused.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Whether it’s learning a new skill, visiting a new place or attempting a challenging puzzle, new experiences and learning opportunities help forge &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7915302/habits-to-add-to-your-day-to-prevent-cognitive-decline/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;new neural connections&lt;/a&gt; and strengthen existing ones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Conversely, research has shown that a lack of mental stimulation in older adults can lead to cognitive decline over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-too-much-social-media"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Too Much Social Media  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Social media may seem like harmless entertainment or a convenient way to stay connected, but it can significantly reshape the way your brain functions,” says Maniscalco. “Platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Facebook are designed to trigger and exploit the brain’s dopamine system—the same reward circuitry involved in motivation, craving and addiction.” Over time, this can lead to negative consequences for your brain health.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One review of multiple studies found that people who had difficulty controlling their internet use tended to have less gray matter in brain regions related to decision-making, self-control and reward processing.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Too much social media can also affect emotional well-being. For instance, research has found that using social media as a primary means of maintaining relationships is linked to feelings of loneliness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To counterbalance the effects of social media and mindless scrolling, schedule “tech-free” time during your day. And don’t forget to make time for meaningful interactions, like phoning or spending time with loved ones.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many seemingly innocent everyday habits may be quietly taking a toll on your brain health. Over time, lack of sleep, smoking, drinking alcohol, skimping on nutritious foods, missing out on new experiences or spending endless hours scrolling can spell trouble for our brains. The impact isn’t just about memory or focus. It touches everything from your mood to long-term cognitive resilience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But here’s the good news: Small changes, like getting enough rest, eating nutritious foods, staying curious, giving up smoking, drinking less alcohol and connecting meaningfully with others, may have a big impact on your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain’s strength&lt;/a&gt;. Take the first step today to break those brain-draining habits. Your future self will thank you with sharper thinking, a better mood and a mind that’s ready to meet life’s challenges head-on.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found that eating about half a cup of pistachios each night for 12 weeks slightly changed the gut microbiome in adults with prediabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There was an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-health-benefits-of-bifobacterium-4684233" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase in beneficial bacteria&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Roseburia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt;, and a reduction in less helpful bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Flavonifractor&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pistachios are best known for their heart-healthy properties. Regular consumption has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ways-to-lower-your-ldl-cholesterol-698071" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower total cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, “bad” &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-ldl-cholesterol-5184515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/normal-triglyceride-levels-5188963" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt;, while slightly increasing or maintaining levels of “good” &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-good-cholesterol-5186544" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some research has found that pistachios lower blood pressure when eaten consistently, but more research needs to be done.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; High blood pressure is linked to conditions like heart attacks and stroke, so maintaining a healthy blood pressure is key to preventing other diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On top of that, because pistachios are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/nutrient-dense-foods-8735811" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in nutrients&lt;/a&gt; like healthy fats, fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/antioxidants-7969374" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, they may help reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some research also shows that pistachios may improve blood vessel function and reduce arterial stiffness, which contribute to a healthier heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Helps with Blood Sugar Control &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pistachios may also support better &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-eat-when-blood-sugar-is-high-5120368" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, especially for those with prediabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/metabolic-syndrome-1745266" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, or a high risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have found that eating up to 1/3 cup of pistachios each day can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-morning-blood-sugar-without-medication-5115958" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower fasting blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, insulin levels, and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/insulin-resistance-8421034" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s also some evidence of improvements in long-term blood sugar control (measured by A1C), although those results are less consistent across studies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. May Support Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While not as thoroughly researched as other benefits, some studies suggest that pistachios might support weight loss efforts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; People who included pistachios in their diet daily tended to eat more fiber and less added sugar compared to those who didn’t.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This could make pistachios a useful snack for those aiming to lose or maintain weight, since diets high in fiber can help you feel full longer. This is especially true when paired with an overall healthy diet and regular physical activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Compared to other commonly consumed nuts, pistachios stand out for their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/nutrient-dense-foods-8735811" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient density&lt;/a&gt;. They contain more fiber, essential amino acids, potassium, and vitamins A than some of their &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/are-nuts-good-for-you-11728577" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nut counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, they’re a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-protein-foods-7496700" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;good source of protein&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding pistachios to your diet may support gut health, heart function, blood sugar control, and even weight management. They’re a nutrient-dense, satisfying snack that can complement a healthy diet, especially for those with prediabetes or other metabolic concerns. Sprinkle them on salads, blend into pesto, or enjoy with fruit for a balanced snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A research project used advanced imaging techniques to overcome past challenges in studying the ATL, revealing its strong activation during social and emotional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest anxiety disrupts the balance between semantic and emotional processing in this region. Ongoing work aims to map ATL connections and understand gender differences in these processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATL’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior temporal lobe is crucial for social and emotional meaning-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Heightened ATL activity in anxious individuals reflects disrupted emotional interpretation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Mapping structural connections like the uncinate fasciculus could uncover pathways behind anxiety and guilt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UJI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding how our brain interprets social hierarchy or facial emotions may be key to advancing our knowledge of anxiety and mood disorders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the aim of the project led by researcher Maya Visser at the Universitat Jaume I in Castelló, which studies the role of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in the brain network that gives meaning to social and emotional concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111752"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and social icons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/alt-social-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;It has also been observed that this brain region shows greater activation in people with high levels of anxiety, possibly because anxiety is associated with negative affect during the interpretation of social concepts — such as feelings of inferiority when seeing a winner or intense guilt when making mistakes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) has traditionally been understudied due to the geometric distortions produced in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which have hindered accurate analysis of this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, previous studies by the NFN group at the Universitat Jaume I have used specific techniques to overcome these limitations and have demonstrated the ATL’s involvement in processing meaning and in making social and emotional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, funded by the 2021 National Plan for Scientific Research, studies how the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) communicates with other brain regions, such as the frontal and limbic areas, when we interpret social situations or express emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it investigates how this network of connections may change in people with varying levels of subclinical anxiety — that is, anxiety levels not reaching the threshold for a formal diagnosis but still capable of affecting brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, preliminary analyses of the project have shown that the upper part of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is strongly activated when individuals interpret social hierarchies or make decisions based on emotional facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been observed that this brain region shows greater activation in people with high levels of anxiety, possibly because anxiety is associated with negative affect durng the interpretation of social concepts — such as feelings of inferiority when seeing a winner or intense guilt when making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such cases, the collaboration between the semantic system (located in the ATL) and the emotional system is disrupted. These findings have already been published and are currently under review by specialized scientific journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, important steps remain. It is necessary to complete the analyses of functional and structural connections between different brain regions, such as the uncinate fasciculus, which connects the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) with the orbitofrontal cortex and may play a key role in processing anxiety and guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as a methodological challenge, efforts are being made to obtain a gender-balanced sample to allow for accurate analysis of gender differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maya Visser is a Ramón y Cajal researcher at the Department of Basic and Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology at the Universitat Jaume I. Over her career, she has participated in neuroimaging projects at research centres in the UK, the Netherlands, and Spain, focusing her research on the role of semantic processing in social and emotional behaviours. S&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he is part of the Neuropsychology and Functional Neuroimaging (NFN) research group, an interdisciplinary team that studies brain mechanisms in both healthy and clinical populations by combining neuroimaging techniques with experimental designs, applying results to fields such as psychology, neurology, education and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this initiative, the Universitat Jaume I reaffirms its commitment to research that combines a fundamental understanding of the human brain with a direct impact on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects like this help us better understand how we think, feel and live together, and they open new perspectives for addressing emotional disorders from the roots of thought and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research is part of project PID2021-127516NB-I00, funded by MICIU/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and FEDER/UE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee8a87989b82898f9b8487ae9b8487c08b9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mari Luz Blanco Burgueño&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uji.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UJI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mari Luz Blanco Burgueño – UJI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2025.106527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subjective sleep quality in healthy young adults moderates associations of sensitivity to punishment and reward with functional connectivity of regions relevant for insomnia disorder&lt;/a&gt;” by Maya Visser et al. &lt;em&gt;SLEEP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjective sleep quality in healthy young adults moderates associations of sensitivity to punishment and reward with functional connectivity of regions relevant for insomnia disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic unhealthy sleeping behaviours are a major risk factor for the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, we are still lacking understanding why some individuals are more prone than others to affective dysregulation caused by sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With preliminary evidence suggesting that brain activity during positive and negative emotional processing might play an important modulating role, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses in a large cohort of healthy young adults (N = 155).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using regions consistently affected in insomnia disorder as seeds, we investigated sleep quality-related neural connectivity patterns that were both insensitive and sensitive to the interactions with individual measures of reward and punishment processing, additionally assessing the links with indices of emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the findings reflected interactions between sleep quality and reinforcement sensitivity, with the opposite associations reported in the good and poor sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of such connections, the coupling between precentral gyrus and posterior insula, was additionally negatively linked to trait anxiety, with the lowest connectivity values observed in poor sleepers with higher sensitivity to punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, the only finding associated solely with sleep quality, i.e. coupling between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus, was also related to the habitual use of emotion suppression strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the present study provides evidence that reinforcement sensitivity plays an essential role in understanding the associations of poor sleep quality with brain connectivity and emotional health, hinting at a potential link that may help explain individual differences in susceptibility to sleep-related affective dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 12:54:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9wWG1MSmtoY2hFSEZTd3VWQWdhdnpXY1RlaDVlS0g5d1hfbFhJbWQwTGJ0bEJHYkp1UXJ4V2hmNnJwbURHZEl3S2pCeFdXSjVYbml5VzJWSjVXT05zdi1ydVVtUHp6UVR3eVB4M3NJZw</guid></item><item><title>我想为我的孩子建造一栋树屋。我的妻子非常害怕这会给我们的孩子带来什么。- Slate杂志 | I Want to Build a Treehouse for My Kids.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8rf4hx00215wkt2n9lakjl@published"&gt;My wife, “Judy” and I have two boys, ages 7 and 9, and they want me to build them a treehouse in the giant oak tree in our backyard. I’m a master carpenter by trade, so this would be no big deal for me. The obstacle to this is that Judy is staunchly against it.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8si1h3000s3b789lewdtao@published"&gt;She is claiming that the boys could fall and injure themselves or “worse.” She also says that if they have friends over, the same thing could happen to them. To her, this mean my boys can’t have a treehouse. I think this shouldn’t even be an issue!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8rjmq7000k3b781q7i1npq@published"&gt;My dad and grandfather built a treehouse for me and my sister when we were kids, and some of my happiest memories are of playing there with her, friends, and cousins.  Nobody got hurt, let alone landed in the hospital!  With all the shit going on in the world right now, if I can give my kids some joy in their lives and allow them to create wonderful memories of their own I really can’t see why Judy is making such a big deal over it.  How can I convince my wife that her stance on this is not a normal one?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8rjmvr000n3b7815bj86uz@published"&gt;Some of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; happiest childhood memories are of playing on concrete playgrounds. But today, most kids playgrounds today are built on softer surfaces because kids &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;often get hurt! Just because you and your folks were never injured in your treehouse doesn’t mean there’s no risk involved. I’m not saying you’re wrong for wanting to build one—and I get that you’re credentialed to do that—but you’re acting like your wife is being unreasonable, and she simply isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8rjmxl000o3b789644w9wq@published"&gt;There’s nothing abnormal about your wife’s stance. She recognizes the risk inherent in building a play structure high off the ground! Kids &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; fall from even a well-made treehouse. What would you do if someone else’s child fell? Do you have the insurance to cover their injuries? Also remember that parents are more litigious today than when you were a kid. The fallout from something like that could be devastating. I’m not asking you to give up your treehouse dreams, but try to understand where your wife is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="147" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8rjmzf000p3b783a2twzov@published"&gt;There’s no guarantee she’ll get on board, but if you want to try to persuade her, I would recommend emphasizing the safety measures you would take to make the treehouse as safe as possible. In an article for &lt;a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/700childrens/2025/05/tree-house-safety"&gt;Nationwide Children’s Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, Laura Dattner of the Center for Injury Research and Policy notes that most treehouse injuries are from falls and jumps. Safety recommendations include that the building to a max height for eight feet; spreading at least nine inches of mulch in a six-foot radius below the treehouse to soften jumps and falls; and installing solid walls instead of rails. Other frequent treehouse injuries come from from ropes, chains, and improperly hammered-in nails. Skip the ropes and chains, and I don’t need to tell a master carpenter to make sure his nails are hammered-in correctly! And check with your homeowner’s insurance company—they may have requirements of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8sxnif000z3b78d338b5ud@published"&gt;Read this post and do more research on treehouse safety. Assure your wife that you’re taking the injury risk seriously and doing what you can to mitigate it. And of course, let her know that you will do your part to ensure the kids are always supervised in the treehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd8rf4hx00265wktrzdr6lop@published"&gt;A couple of years ago, my parents decided to downsize. They sold our family home and put the cabin where we spent much of our childhood on the market. The cabin was in a perilous state but obviously had fond memories so, after they had it professionally valued, I offered them their asking price and bought it from them. I refurbished it and now use it as a holiday rental. The problem is that my sister-in-law has now decided that our refurbished cabin, which she never showed much interest in before I fixed it up, is now a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/07/family-cabin-nightmare-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;communal family asset available for her use at will&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A study using high-density EEG recordings found that awakening begins in frontal regions and spreads backward, with distinct patterns depending on whether you wake from REM or non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In non-REM sleep, slower waves precede faster wake-like activity, while REM sleep skips directly to wakefulness.

Instead, it orchestrates a precise sequence of activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving waves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers worked with high-density EEG-data, which offers information about the time and location of brain activity. When looking at the activity progression throughout the awakening brain, they observed a clear sequence: it starts in central and frontal brain regions and gradually spreads toward the back of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aurélie Stephan, first author, is not surprised by this sequence of events: “This progression likely reflects how signals from subcortical arousal centres (deeper in the brain) reach the cortex, with shorter paths to frontal areas and longer ones toward regions further back”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Stages: REM vs non-REM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how the brain navigates waking up at any moment, the researchers specifically studied awakening patterns in two stages: REM sleep, commonly associated with vivid dreams, and non-REM sleep, also known as deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants awoke from non-REM sleep, their brain activity first showed a brief surge in slower sleep-like waves immediately followed by faster activity related to wakefulness. When participants awoke from REM sleep, the slower waves were skipped, leading to a more direct boost in faster brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain responds differently to arousing signals depending on the stage it’s in”, Stephan explains. “In non-REM sleep, neurons that connect arousal centres to the cortex alternate between states of activity and silence – a dynamic known as “bistability”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this bistability, any arousing stimulus first triggers a slow wave, before transitioning to faster activity. In contrast, REM sleep does not have this bistable pattern, so the cortex immediately responds with the fast, wake-like, activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding sleepiness and sleep-disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated how sleepy a participant felt when they woke up. While participants felt the sleepiest when awoken from REM sleep, Stephan is most intrigued by the impact of the slow waves in non-REM sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a new aspect in which slow waves can present very distinct and opposite behaviours. Some slow waves are actually acting like arousal elements – they are part of the “wake up!” signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more these waves occur just before awakening, the more alert you tend to feel upon awakening. While the other slow waves – whether they are present before waking up or persisting after – are the reason we sometimes feel so sleepy in the first moments of the day”, Stephan explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephan hopes these findings can be used for future research into sleep disorders, such as insomnia or conditions involving incomplete awakenings. “If we understand the process more, we can also better identify signs of hyperarousal in sleep disorders”, she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Stephan is excited about the future avenues. “This study provides a new perspective looks at the brain’s journey from sleep to wakefulness yet, offering a window into one of the most fundamental transitions in human consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, consciousness, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f396dd9596969d80878192b39d9a9ddd989d9284dd9d9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eline Feenstra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nin.knaw.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KNAW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eline Feenstra – KNAW&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.06.064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cortical activity upon awakening from sleep reveals consistent spatio-temporal gradients across sleep stages in human EEG&lt;/a&gt;” by Aurélie Stephan et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortical activity upon awakening from sleep reveals consistent spatio-temporal gradients across sleep stages in human EEG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the brain awaken from sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested that the awakening process occurs asynchronously across brain regions, but the precise nature of these changes and how they are reflected in human electroencephalography (EEG) remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we recorded 1,073 awakenings and arousals with high-density EEG and mapped brain activity at a second-to-second timescale around movement onset using source modeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that cortical activity upon awakening progressed along highly consistent spatial and frequency gradients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In awakenings and arousals from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, transient increases in low-frequency power preceded increases in high-frequency power by a few seconds, whereas awakenings from REM sleep were mainly characterized by increases in high-frequency power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of sleep stage, high-frequency changes were first seen in frontal and last in occipital and inferior-temporal cortical areas, whereas low-frequency changes in NREM sleep started in a centro-parietal “hotspot,” progressed frontally, and reached occipital and inferior-temporal regions last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the presence of these spatio-temporal arousal patterns during sleep, before participants were awakened by sounds, was followed by lower sleepiness ratings upon awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate a consistent spatio-temporal EEG signature of the awakening process that likely reflects the structural organization of arousal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a transient increase in slow EEG frequencies, which are normally associated with sleep, is inherent to the arousal process and functionally correlates with feeling more awake when awakening from NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for the interpretation of arousal signals and the detection of incomplete awakenings in sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an exciting development for both the energy and nuclear industries, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.radiantnuclear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Radiant Industries Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a California-based startup, is preparing to test its groundbreaking &lt;strong&gt;1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactor&lt;/strong&gt; in 2026, according to&lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/energy/worlds-first-mass-produced-nuclear-reactor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Interesting Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The reactor is poised to play a major role in revolutionizing how we think about&lt;strong&gt; power generation&lt;/strong&gt; in remote, off-grid locations. This major step forward follows a significant financial boost, with Radiant raising &lt;strong&gt;$165 million&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Series C funding&lt;/strong&gt;, bringing its total capital raised to&lt;strong&gt; $225 million&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Era for Nuclear Power&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the idea of a &lt;strong&gt;portable nuclear reactor&lt;/strong&gt; might seem like science fiction. But Kaleidos, designed for modularity and rapid deployment, offers a new and practical solution to power delivery in regions where traditional energy infrastructure is scarce or non-existent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Powered by a &lt;strong&gt;helium gas-cooling&lt;/strong&gt; design, this microreactor eliminates the need for &lt;strong&gt;water-based cooling systems&lt;/strong&gt;, which not only improves its reliability in challenging environments but also simplifies its logistics. It’s precisely this combination of innovative design and adaptability that has drawn the attention of investors and government bodies alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The Kaleidos reactor’s versatility is particularly noteworthy. It’s not just another piece of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/this-chinese-technology-is-beyond-imagination-faster-than-an-airplane-and-already-tested/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="84949" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cutting-edge technology&lt;/a&gt;; it’s built with a clear purpose in mind—providing consistent and reliable power where it’s needed most. Whether it’s deployed in a remote settlement, a military forward operating base, or a disaster-stricken region, the microreactor promises to fill the energy gap where conventional methods can’t reach.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Rendering of the Radiant Kaleidos microreactor." data-lazy-src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuEV4xZmLdUg/v1/-1x-1.webp"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuEV4xZmLdUg/v1/-1x-1.webp" alt="Rendering of the Radiant Kaleidos microreactor."&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rendering of the Radiant Kaleidos microreactor. &lt;em&gt;Credit: US Department of Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Federal Support and Strategic Partnerships&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential of Kaleidos has caught the eye of both the private sector and government entities. Recently, Radiant secured backing from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;/strong&gt;, which has agreed to supply the company with &lt;strong&gt;high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU)&lt;/strong&gt; for the first reactor test. This move underscores the increasing federal support for &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/nuclear-thermal-propulsion-reactor-fuel-that-could-take-humans-to-mars-tested-at-nasa-facility/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76695" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;next-generation nuclear technologies,&lt;/a&gt; which are becoming a critical part of the U.S. energy strategy—especially in the context of national security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;DOE’s&lt;/strong&gt; involvement is a pivotal moment for Radiant, and it’s no surprise that the company has garnered significant backing from investors such as &lt;strong&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Chevron Technology Ventures&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Founders Fund&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. These investors are betting that Radiant’s approach to nuclear power could usher in a new wave of energy innovation that aligns with both climate goals and national security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Makes Kaleidos Stand Out?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly sets Kaleidos apart from traditional reactors? The answer lies in its design. Unlike conventional nuclear reactors that rely heavily on water for cooling, &lt;strong&gt;Kaleidos&lt;/strong&gt; uses helium gas, a feature that gives it a distinct edge. This makes the microreactor more suitable for challenging environments, such as military bases or disaster zones, where access to water may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reactor is also designed with a &lt;strong&gt;passive safety architecture&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that it can continue to operate safely even if certain systems fail. This added level of security is a key selling point for those considering the reactor for deployment in high-risk or unpredictable environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another standout feature of the Kaleidos is its &lt;strong&gt;ease of transport&lt;/strong&gt;. The system is designed to be &lt;strong&gt;air&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;road&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;sea transportable&lt;/strong&gt;, making it an ideal candidate for rapid deployment in emergency situations or to regions that are in urgent need of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

How is it diagnosed, and what treatments are available? What can people do to reduce the risk of contracting the disease? And how much should people be worried about plague?

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Pneumonic plague is one of three types of plagues that are caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F17782-plague&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727398100%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=2eS3FL1Pz26EPW3LnYfIENdL%2FCkJwl1vgUkYjcPVL4Y%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;type of plague&lt;/a&gt; someone has is classified based on where the bacteria are concentrated. Bubonic plague infects lymph nodes. Septicemic plague is when the bacteria cause a whole-body infection through the bloodstream, and pneumonic plague affects the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on the type of plague. Bubonic plague is typically caused by the bite of an infected &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2024%2F07%2F05%2Fhealth%2Fplague-human-risk-explainer%2Findex.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727415565%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=frtW1Y%2BLSAgysz6NOX%2B6kwGgdGKL9XWiAuZw8Dp2wHY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;rodent flea&lt;/a&gt;. It can progress to septicemic plague, which can also arise as a result of handling infected animals such as rats and cats. Cats and other animals can contract the plague through eating rodents or through the bite of fleas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6iorqt000z3b6n907743m2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pneumonic plague develops when the bacteria spread to the lungs in someone who started out with bubonic or septicemic plague. It can also occur when the bacteria are directly transmitted through airborne droplets — if someone inhales droplets containing the Yersinia bacteria that are coughed by an infected person or animal. This is the only form of the plague that can be spread from person to person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; People infected with all three forms develop common infectious symptoms including fever, headache, chills and weakness. Those with bubonic plague have one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes, also called buboes. In septicemic plague, the seeding of bacteria to other parts of the body can cause multi-organ failure and total body shock. Pneumonic plague is characterized by a rapidly progressing pneumonia with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough and chest pain.

Because the disease progresses very quickly and effective antibiotic therapies exist, prompt recognition is crucial. In cases where there is a high level of suspicion, antibiotics are often started in advance of confirmatory testing.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can people do to reduce the risk of contracting the plague?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Most Americans do not live in areas where plague can be found. For those in Western US states where plague has occurred, there are &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coconino.az.gov%2FCivicAlerts.aspx%3FAID%3D3242%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawLfXHRleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFCd3hlUjY2M1ZGNURMRFdFAR5cdhAbD4Nab71-FQNNDDI_CXVgccQw2SMLR5OknCEoxkTUi1wDajEe0TzLvQ_aem_WYG09QZujnbgF13qssTFqQ&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727620660%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=2f%2BipoOjDDGfhrUOB2Y0XQJ4V5mx4g2QvV3fkTY5KEI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;several actions&lt;/a&gt; they can take to reduce their potential exposure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001m3b6nh9fpncjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, avoid contact with wild animals. Do not handle wild rodents. Do not touch sick or dead animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001n3b6nplcoduve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, because most cases are associated with rodents, people should prevent rodent infestation by storing pet food in rodent-proof containers and removing brush and trash around homes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001o3b6n5wz990i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, avoid fleabites. Wear long sleeves and use insect repellent containing DEET if you are hiking, camping or working outdoors. Keep fleas away from household pets by using veterinarian-approved flea control products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001p3b6nmtk0tvv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fourth, keep pets out of areas known to be inhabited by wild rodents. Be on the outlook for illnesses in domestic animals, especially indoor-outdoor cats, and seek prompt veterinary care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001q3b6njo0zl5rc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of this said, I think it’s important to be reminded of how uncommon plague is. People who live in areas where plague has been found should take preventive measures, and clinicians should ask about travel history to these areas. Most Americans, though, do not need to be concerned about plague based on this single recent case in Arizona.
    &lt;/p&gt;

They’re&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/upshot/boys-falling-behind-data.html"&gt; falling behind women academically&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://generations.org/tabs/none/podcasts/41186"&gt;making less money &lt;/a&gt;than their dads and grandfathers, and are so desperate for kinship and community that they’ve started &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/23/nx-s1-5260230/stick-nation-sticktok"&gt;posting sticks on Instagram and asking each other to rank them&lt;/a&gt;. It’s tough out there, and now that the weather is heating up, it’s about to get tougher.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9rn000g3b78l9gjnv2c@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;A man told me something a few years ago that haunts me to this day: every summer, his balls get bigger. Not to the extent that he has to purchase &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2013/12/underwear-company-to-men-get-on-womens-level.html"&gt;new underwear &lt;/a&gt;or anything, but enough to make a noticeable difference when he wears trunks or loose boxers. Every June or so, like clockwork, his “summer long balls” come in. It’s one of the harbingers of summer, sort of like a collie shedding its top coat or &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-are-people-mad-sabrina-carpenter-album-cover.html"&gt;Sabrina Carpenter releasing a new single.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9tm000h3b789q50rbiv@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;This guy says he doesn’t have strong feelings about his Summer Long Balls. “It’s not something I either like or dislike,” he said. “It is simply a reality.” But I don’t think he’s being entirely truthful. I’ve gone to the beach with him, and on at least one occasion, he had to find a Target en route and duck into the bathroom to self-adjust because his balls had gotten twisted in his trunks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9vc000i3b785l79gygw@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;I had to know if this condition was specific to this one man, or if it was something that all men struggled with but  just didn’t talk about publicly. When I asked around my social circle, about half the men I polled didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. Others, however, acutely felt the pain of summer long balls. “It sucks,” one person told me. “I wish I could wear sluttier shorts in the summer. But I can’t do so comfortably.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9x1000j3b78e8ewmcrm@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;Another told me he experiences a variation on summer long balls in which sweat causes the skin from his scrotum to stick to his leg, creating what he dubs a “bat wing” effect. “You have to make sure no one sees you grab your crotch to rearrange if you’re in public,” he says. I even heard about a guy whose testicles were so distended they hit the toilet water when he sat down in a public restroom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64z9ys000k3b78427bcsa9@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Some pointed out the similarity to “&lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/summer-penis-is-real-and-its-spectacular"&gt;summer penis&lt;/a&gt;,” the term coined by MEL Magazine’s Tracy Moore in 2018 to describe the way some men’s genitals appear to swell during the summer. This phenomenon, Moore writes, is caused by vasodilation, or the dilation of blood vessels to allow for increased flow to erectile tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64za0l000l3b78j1t58rqt@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;But this is not the case for summer long balls, according to New Jersey urologist Anika Ackerman, which instead result from body self-regulating in warmer climates, so the testicles are at optimal temperature for sperm production. “When it’s a cold environment, the testicles move towards the body, and the scrotum tenses up,” Ackerman explained. (Think: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsH4aClj-ZY"&gt;George Costanza’s shrinkage incident&lt;/a&gt;.) “The opposite is true in a warm environment. The scrotum relaxes and the testicles move away from the body.” It’s not so much that men’s testicles become bigger in the heat; it’s that they travel further away from the body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64za2f000m3b78dgn7lwk3@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Still, the question remained: why do some men clearly experience summer long balls, while others don’t? And approximately what percentage of the male population is at risk, so to speak? I called Yaniv Larish, a urologist and surgeon at Fifth Avenue Urology, to see if he had any &lt;a href="http://theories.he"&gt;theories.&lt;/a&gt; He suspects that a good proportion of summer long ball cases are actually men with varicoceles, or enlarged veins within the scrotum. (Which is basically like varicose veins, but for your ballsack.) “When you have a varicocele, the blood is not moving around efficiently, so instead of circulating around the testicle and pulling the heat away, it’s pooling up and actually insulating the testicle at an elevated temperature,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64za8a000n3b783ao58qj5@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;About 15 percent of the male population has a varicocele in either one or both testicles. They’re often undiagnosed, because “men are way less educated about their bodies than women are,” Lavish says Varicoceles are usually harmless, but in some cases they can be linked to decreased fertility, in which case they are treated with minor surgery. “What you’re describing as summer long balls is, I suspect, really the varicocele becoming more pronounced as a result of the elevated temperature,” Larish says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64zaah000o3b78frnp4x3b@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;If a man in your life is struggling with summer long balls, there are a few things he can do to alleviate his discomfort. Wearing tight underwear, for instance, can offer scrotal support; it’s also helpful to spend as much time in the air-conditioned indoors as possible, as hotter environments aren’t great for testicular health overall. Ackerman also told me about a product called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vasectomy-Ice-Pack-Underwear-Inserts/dp/B09SQH4J81?tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20718aam__cmd64qiqz00000if9xx84wbm1__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;“Nutsicles”&lt;/a&gt; — essentially, an ice pack for the testicles — that could possibly help, though it is intended primarily for men who have had vastectomies and not Summer Long Ball sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmd64zac5000p3b78o48swvqv@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;While there is no hard-and-fast cure for Summer Long Balls, the good news is that it’s temporary. Once the temperature goes down, so, too, will the circumference of a man’s balls. Men can also take solace in the fact that summer long balls can provide, if nothing else, a new opportunity for creative expression. “Actually, I think they’re kind of awesome,” a friend told me. “When they’re hanging way the heck down you can really grab a handful of them and twist them around, or pull them up to do a bullfrog.” Who says men don’t have hobbies?&lt;/p&gt;

(At the time, Slate’s main drug was a testosterone treatment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;During a presentation, scientists showed &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64955317/walking-brain-health-fast-results/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64955317/walking-brain-health-fast-results/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; scan images comparing how women with normal desire and women with HSDD reacted to erotic materials. The condition is described by the &lt;a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Sexual Health Association" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;American Sexual Health Association&lt;/a&gt; as “the absence of sexual fantasies and thoughts, and/or desire for or receptivity to, sexual activity that causes the person distress or difficulties.” Cindy compares HSDD to a light switch in the brain that can essentially shut off libido. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The proof was in the pictures: Women with the condition had very little to no activation in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a61556368/sex-party-pleasure-essay/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a61556368/sex-party-pleasure-essay/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pleasure" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;pleasure&lt;/a&gt; centers of the brain compared to women with normal &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a60441982/how-to-initiate-sex-desire-types/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a60441982/how-to-initiate-sex-desire-types/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="desire" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt;. “Here it was in black-and-white, but everyone sat there looking at their phones,” Cindy says. She glanced around at the group and wondered, &lt;em data-node-id="2.5"&gt;Well, who’s doing something about this?&lt;/em&gt; As the old adage goes, if you want something done right—or, in the case of women’s sexual health, at all—you gotta do it yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="4" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="sprout pharmaceuticals" title="sprout pharmaceuticals" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feahavesexlivelonger-002-1-6875611b18786.jpg?crop=0.735xw:0.588xh;0.148xw,0.214xh&amp;amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feahavesexlivelonger-002-1-6875611b18786.jpg?crop=0.735xw:0.588xh;0.148xw,0.214xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feahavesexlivelonger-002-1-6875611b18786.jpg?crop=0.735xw:0.588xh;0.148xw,0.214xh&amp;amp;resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125feahavesexlivelonger-002-1-6875611b18786.jpg?crop=0.735xw:0.588xh;0.148xw,0.214xh&amp;amp;resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Joe Lingeman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="5.0"&gt;A self-proclaimed&lt;/strong&gt; science nerd, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/cindypinkceo/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/cindypinkceo/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cindy" data-node-id="5.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt; was drawn to the field of sexual health because it was a relatively new concept, ripe for discovery. Despite the “taboo” nature of her work, she loved that the findings made a real difference in people’s lives. “From the moment I stepped into the male sexual health space, my fascination was: This matters in someone’s overall life experience,” she says. “Sex is an integral part of the human experience, and when you can improve that for somebody, it’s the highest reward.” But seeing those images at the conference—and realizing that no one else seemed to care—spurred Cindy to ask the “obvious,” she says: &lt;em data-node-id="5.4"&gt;How can we have as many as 26 FDA-approved medications for men to lead a more satisfying sex life and not a single one for women?  &lt;/em&gt;“I knew, based on the data, more women than men actually struggle” with sexual dysfunction.&lt;br data-node-id="5.6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About half of women—40 to 50 percent—will, at some point in their life, suffer from at least one of the four main types of sexual dysfunction: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and pain disorders. The most prevalent is HSDD, affecting about 10 percent of women, predominantly those age 45 and older. In fact, nearly 42 percent of women report a drop in sexual desire during perimenopause. Meanwhile, erectile dysfunction—the main type of sexual dysfunction in men—affects up to 14 percent of men under age 40, increasing to about 52 percent between ages 40 and 70. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Cindy, the issue was also personal. She’d struggled with symptoms of HSDD, as well as with the (lack of) treatment options. “Here I was, running a company for men to lead more satisfying sex lives and missing out on having one of my own,” she says. “I wanted that part of myself back, but I was dismissed when I brought up the concern to my ob-gyn.” She was told it was a psychological problem and the solution was to light candles, practice mindfulness—just &lt;em data-node-id="7.1"&gt;relax&lt;/em&gt;. HSDD took a toll on her relationship, which ended, and on her self-confidence as well. “I’d accepted that dim reality,” she says. But when she saw the numbers and the science on that screen, “lightning struck.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="8" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“Sex is an integral part of the human experience, and when you can improve that for somebody, it’s the highest reward.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Cindy spent the next year working with the “best sexual medicine doctors in the world” and listening to female patients share their experiences. “They came from all walks of life, but every person’s story at some point was exactly the same,” she recalls. “I thought, &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;That’s me. I’m them. This is the same struggle&lt;/em&gt;.” Despite being in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a64703230/preventative-couples-therapy-improve-relationship-marriage/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a64703230/preventative-couples-therapy-improve-relationship-marriage/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="happy relationships" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;happy relationships&lt;/a&gt;, these women had little to no sexual desire. When they were intimate with their partners, it often took the form of “mercy sex,” because they loved their partner and wanted them to feel pleasure, even though the women weren’t experiencing any themselves. The worst part: They didn’t know why they felt this way—and all of the so-called solutions (date nights, relaxing bubble baths, etc.) didn’t work. &lt;br data-node-id="9.5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Those real-talk conversations were Cindy’s secret fuel as she sold Slate Pharmaceuticals, founded Sprout Pharmaceuticals, and began the grueling six-year FDA approval process for Addyi, the first medication designed to treat HSDD in premenopausal women. She was determined that she and all those other women would be taken seriously for what they knew was happening to them biologically—&lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;HSDD is believed&lt;/strong&gt; to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain (not unlike anxiety and depression), and flibanserin—the active ingredient in Addyi—impacts mood. “That’s how it was first discovered: It was a mood drug that had an interesting side effect in that it made you think about sex,” Cindy says. The way that flibanserin works in the brain is not fully understood, but it’s believed to interact with serotonin receptors, increasing the release of dopamine and norepinephrine, both of which play a role in sexual response and behavior. “I am a firm believer that women’s biggest sex organ is here,” she says, pointing to her temple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many antidepressants and antianxiety medications, such as Lexapro, Zoloft, and Prozac, are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which primarily work by increasing serotonin but can also have an indirect effect on dopamine. That one-two punch is known to decrease sex drive (one of the common side effects of SSRIs), so the theory goes that because flibanserin appears to act on those neurotransmitters in the opposite way, it would have the opposite effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As Cindy and her team began developing Addyi, which she dubbed “the little pink pill,” the hyperfeminine hue also became her armor. Challenging the status quo was not easy, even with a track record. “I’d built a successful company in men’s [sexual] health, yet everyone would pat me on the shoulder and almost in a singsong voice say, ‘Oh, the little pink pill, that’s cute,’” she says. “It was so obvious what was embedded in that—making it trivial, the perceived weakness of femininity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Her “unapologetically pink” outlook began to form, almost turning into a battle cry. She started wearing pink every day, and the shade became brighter and bolder with each subsequent FDA hearing for Addyi. She didn’t care if they didn’t take her seriously at first. She would no longer be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Now, when she wears pink, she feels as if she’s “suiting up to go on mission.” That mission? To empower women. “It’s you getting to live your life on your own terms with complete agency over your pleasure,” Cindy says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;That proud pink&lt;/strong&gt; stance wasn’t her natural inclination. Like many women, Cindy had “absolutely no sex education” growing up, she says. Her father worked for the State Department, and she moved so much that she was in a different school every year from fourth grade through high school. “No chance I was getting clear messaging on sex,” she says, other than the societal narrative that “pleasure is a man’s to receive and a woman’s to deliver.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;She sees firsthand the lasting effects of this notion. Whenever she meets someone new—say, at a cocktail party—and they ask what she does, she watches their reaction carefully as she explains her work with Addyi. “If it’s a male-female couple, the woman kind of shuts down, like, ‘Oh yeah, okay, I don’t need that,’ and the man leans forward and goes, ‘Can I take it?’” she says. “You see societal conditioning in a snapshot: The woman’s like, ‘I’m not supposed to talk about this,’ and the man’s like, ‘I am entitled to this.’” That might explain why, although Addyi received FDA approval and came on the market in 2015, you haven’t heard much about it. “It tells you how deeply embedded this is culturally—the daring to talk about women’s sexual pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="19" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“I am a firm believer that women’s biggest sex organ is the brain.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Addyi was immediately dubbed “the female Viagra,” and for better or worse (mostly for worse, per Cindy), the moniker stuck. “In a way, you think [the comparison] is amazing: This can be as transformative for women’s health as Viagra was for men’s. But it also sets up the wrong notion of how desire works for women,” Cindy says. “Sex, for women, is not the performative act. It’s about being in the headspace of feeling sexy, being interested, responding to your partner or to [other] cues. We’re brain flow, not blood flow.” &lt;br data-node-id="20.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The comparison to Viagra also epitomizes the double standard that Cindy has spent a decade trying to dismantle. “The atrocity of women’s health is that we’re not taken seriously, and it shows up in so many ways,” she says. “First, it shows up in the regulatory queue, where there’s a double standard to get to an approval.” Viagra was “deemed to meet such an important unmet medical need” that the FDA fast-tracked the review process and approved it in less than six months. Despite having “three times as many patients’ worth of data” proving the efficacy of Addyi, Cindy says, it spent six years in the regulatory queue waiting for approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That double standard also shows up in advertising guidelines: &lt;em data-node-id="22.1"&gt;Hypoactive sexual desire disorder&lt;/em&gt; contains the word &lt;em data-node-id="22.3"&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt; (the horror!), whereas &lt;em data-node-id="22.5"&gt;erectile dysfunction&lt;/em&gt; does not. “When we first put up ads, they were all taken down,” Cindy says. Even now, you’ll find Addyi commercials mostly on podcasts with a female-leaning audience, not on national TV, in clear contrast to the onslaught of ads for mail-order generic Viagra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="23" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="las vegas, nevada march 01: cindy eckert speaks at world's hottest menopause party at worre studios on march 01, 2025 in las vegas, nevada.

Perimenopausal women are the largest demographic using Addyi—a patient group that has been, until recently, largely ignored, undermined, and misdiagnosed. (Right now, Addyi is FDA-approved only to treat premenopausal women, but Cindy just received word that it’s been “fast-tracked” for approval in postmenopausal women in the U.S., which is a promising sign.) &lt;br data-node-id="24.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Whether officially diagnosed with HSDD or not, women in perimenopause tend to face the same struggles: mood imbalances, libido shifts, weight gain, and sleep disturbances. “Addyi works on every single one of those things,” Cindy says, adding that it does so without hormones. For women who can’t use vaginal estrogen or hormone replacement therapy for other medical reasons, Addyi can be a boon, but the comparison to Viagra has “almost allowed the medical community to not understand how Addyi works,” she says. “Sometimes I’ll sit in a room with physicians and say, ‘Tell me how it works.’ They don’t know that it’s brain chemistry.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;To be clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.1"&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; progress has been made. Today, you can’t pass a board exam to be an ob-gyn or urologist without answering a question about Addyi. Still, Cindy dreams of the day when doctors ask about sexual satisfaction as a routine part of a woman’s annual checkup. The longer-term goal is changing what the medical establishment prioritizes, from the top down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Cindy views the advocacy work she’s done with Addyi as part of a larger health care revolution. “Women are now like, ‘I’m gonna demand the care I deserve,’” she says. “The female population is challenging the medical establishment. It’s finally happening. Medicine’s following their lead, not the other way around.” At the front of that invigorated pack?
