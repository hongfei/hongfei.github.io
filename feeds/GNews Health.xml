					&lt;p&gt;Israeli scientists have developed an innovative method to track the human body’s circadian rhythms, finding in a new peer-reviewed study that female sex hormones have a dramatic effect on the setting of these internal circadian clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human body has a central circadian clock in the brain that helps control its daily rhythms — but there are also circadian clocks within almost every cell in the body that follow their own tick-tocking beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers mapped circadian clocks across many cells using their method, called CircaSCOPE, to find that these female sex hormones — especially progesterone — along with the stress hormone cortisol, have a dramatic effect on the setting of these internal timers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;When these clocks are not coordinated, people can experience serious health problems, including sleep disorders, diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body “needs to synchronize millions of clocks because they are present in every cell in our body,” said Prof. Gad Asher of the Weizmann Institute of Science’s Asher lab, recently speaking to The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="New study shows that female sex hormones can impact the body’s inner clocks"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;“Sex hormones are very important in shifting the clock,” Asher said. “Female hormones have a much more prominent effect compared to male hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the researchers still “don’t know how this influences men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher noted that the experiments were done in cell cultures and have not yet been tested in animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;However, he said, “We now know how these clocks communicate, so maybe we can explain their involvement in various disorders and pathologies, and help patients whose internal timing is disrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research could also shed light on disruptions to circadian clocks during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Gal Manella, Dr. Saar Ezagouri, and Nityanand Bolshette, was published in the scientific journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67349-5"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our internal clocks sometimes beat to different times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, Asher said, “people thought that there is only one main clock in the brain which responds to light and dark and coordinates our daily physiology, metabolism, and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, about 25 years ago, scientists discovered that there are “clocks in every cell, in every tissue” in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks are affected not only by external signals such as sunlight but also by signals carried through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;When the body’s internal time is not aligned with the environment, it could lead to many pathologies, Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best example is jet lag or shift workers, in which the person’s internal time is not in accordance with the environmental time,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The brain receives information from the eyes about light and darkness,” Asher said. “Light and dark are the main time signals for the brain. But now, in the past year, it’s becoming more and more evident that illnesses might be related to the fact that clocks in different organs are not synchronized with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, he said, “The clock in the liver should be synchronized, or should show a similar time as the clock in the kidney or the clock in the brain, but this is not always the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Low oxygen levels impact circadian rhythms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of studies on animal models, researchers in Asher’s lab showed that oxygen acts like a signal helping internal clocks know what time it is. When oxygen levels change, cells use that information to adjust internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Asher joined an expedition to La Rinconada, Peru, the highest inhabited settlement in the world, located 5,300 meters (17,388 feet) above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this high altitude, Asher said the lower levels of oxygen altered the daily rhythm of many genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings might be of relevance to the fact that many low oxygen-related pathologies, such as heart disease and asthma exacerbation, show daytime occurrence, in particular during the early morning hours,” Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A wall of clocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other signals carried through the blood that might serve as time tellers for internal clocks, Asher said, “yet their identity was only partially known.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Asher’s work, these blood-borne signals had not been fully mapped because researchers lacked a precise and efficient method for tracking the clock’s response to different signals over a full 24-hour cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weizmann scientists’ &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26210-1"&gt;CircaSCOPE&lt;/a&gt; uses an array of human cells, each representing a different time of day, resembling a wall lined with clocks showing the current time in major cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher’s lab was not damaged during the Iranian ballistic missile strike in June 2025, though he noted that some of the experiments used for the research paper were delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers were able to monitor the clock in every cell in a petri dish in the culture. When they exposed the cell to a signal, they could “characterize if the clock was moving forward, backward, or not responding,” Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, it would have taken the researchers months to do this work. He said that the novel method enables them to screen for dozens of compounds within a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we suspect that a certain compound affects the clock, we add it to the cells, and we can see exactly where their clocks are moving in each cell,” said Asher. “This is a very powerful approach which can generate a lot of information about how the clock is responsive to different signals.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of the Cry2 protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to uncovering the influence of sex hormones, Asher’s study revealed that the clock component receiving these signals in the blood is the protein CRY2 (Cryptochrome 2), rather than PER2 (Period 2), as previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems that the sex hormones, as well as many other signals, are acting through the CRY2 protein,” he said. “It probably transfers the information into the clock in the cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From an evolutionary angle, that’s intriguing,” said Prof. Yoav Gothilf of Tel Aviv University’s School of Biochemistry, Neurobiology and Biophysics, whose lab explores various aspects of the circadian clock and its significance in the life of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gothilf, who was not involved in the study, explained that in early, simple organisms, CRY2-like proteins responded directly to light, acting like a light sensor. As animals became more complex, CRY2 kept its job of synchronizing internal clocks, but the signal it listened to changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems the role of CRY2 in synchronizing clocks has been conserved, but the signal it responds to has changed, from light in early life forms to hormones in mammals,” Gothilf said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gothilf said that Asher’s study suggests that “daily, age-specific waves of hormones can shift the timing of our internal clocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings offer a “compelling” biological explanation for “how a morning-loving child will turn into a night-owl teenager, and later drift back toward morningness as an adult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher said that his lab will continue to research the roles of these hormones in circadian clocks, perhaps testing the idea on lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can now identify compounds, and we identify that the sex hormones are important, changing throughout life,” he said. “Identifying molecules that are potent time signals for clocks has major importance in treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Older adults can dramatically reduce the amount of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; they eat while keeping a familiar, balanced diet – and this shift leads to improvements across several key markers related to how the body regulates appetite and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the main finding of a new study my colleagues and I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2025.10.010"&gt;published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are made using industrial techniques and ingredients that aren't typically used in home cooking. They often contain additives such as emulsifiers, flavorings, colors, and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-studies-link-food-preservatives-to-higher-risk-of-cancer-and-diabetes"&gt;Major Studies Link Food Preservatives to Higher Risk of Cancer And Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common examples include packaged snacks, ready-to-eat meals, and some processed meats.

One included lean red meat (pork); the other was vegetarian with milk and eggs. For two weeks in between, participants returned to their usual diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 43 people began the dietary intervention, and 36 completed the full study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both diets, ultra-processed foods made up less than 15% of the total calories – a significant reduction from &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/cdc/174612"&gt;the typical American diet&lt;/a&gt;, where more than 50% of total calories come from ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diets were designed to be realistic for everyday eating, and participants were not instructed to restrict calories, lose weight, or change their physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg" alt="Flatlay of various fresh healthy foods" class="size-medium wp-image-186951" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maintaining metabolic health promotes healthy aging.

During the periods when participants ate fewer ultra-processed foods, they naturally consumed fewer calories and lost weight, including total and abdominal body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond weight loss, they also showed meaningful improvements in insulin sensitivity, healthier cholesterol levels, fewer signs of inflammation, and favorable changes in hormones that help regulate appetite and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements were similar whether participants followed the meat-based or the vegetarian diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114523003033"&gt;make up more than half the calories&lt;/a&gt; consumed by most US adults. Although these foods are convenient and widely available, studies that track people's diets over time increasingly link them with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01565-X"&gt;obesity and age-related chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as Type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="188723" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With older adults making up a growing share of the global population, strategies that preserve metabolic health could support healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most previous feeding studies testing how ultra-processed foods affect people's health &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008"&gt;haven't reflected real-world eating&lt;/a&gt;, especially among Americans. For example, some studies have compared diets made up almost entirely of ultra-processed foods with diets that contain little to none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study aimed to more closely approximate people's experience while still closely tracking the foods they consumed. It is the first to show that for older adults, a realistic reduction in ultra-processed foods, outside the lab, has measurable health benefits beyond just losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-021-1609-3"&gt;For older adults especially&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining metabolic health helps preserve mobility, independence, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's still unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study was small, reflecting the complexity of studies in which researchers tightly control what participants eat. It was not designed to show whether the metabolic improvements we observed can prevent or delay diseases such as diabetes or heart disease over time. Larger, longer studies will be needed to answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the practical side, it's still unclear whether people can cut back on ultra-processed foods in their daily lives without structured support, and what strategies would make it easier to do so. It's also not fully understood which aspects of processing – for example, additives, emulsifiers, or extrusion – matter more for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering these questions could help manufacturers produce foods that are healthier but still convenient – and make it easier for people to choose healthier food options.

They added that exposures may have occurred during school hours at South Summit Elementary School on Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the state, the Utah County Health District has reported 24 cases, with Wasatch County at nine and Salt Lake County with six cases. Less than 20 of Utah's confirmed cases have resulted in hospitalizations, according to the department's &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The border of Utah-Arizona makes up one of the two hot spots in the country for measles, along with South Carolina, where more than 300 cases of the virus were confirmed over the holidays, according to the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-quarantine-mmr-vaccine-south-carolina-1056c1fb1ce707e4b51729ecaeb5850e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51422706/6-new-measles-cases-reported-in-utah-county" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Last month&lt;/a&gt;, state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen said Utah's measles case count for 2025 was the most cases in a year in more than three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to warn that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;measles is an extremely contagious respiratory disease &lt;/a&gt;— causing serious medical complications, including blindness and even death, among vulnerable age groups and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say vaccination is the best way to prevent a measles infection with two doses of the MMR vaccine said to provide 97% protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, 185 of the 201 people who have been infected with measles were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information on the nationwide measles outbreak can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CDC's&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Berkeley officials are warning the public about leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that can be fatal in dogs and humans, after animals in the &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/harrison-street-corridor/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Harrison Street corridor&lt;/a&gt; tested positive in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numerous rats" and at least two dogs in the area — the site of a longstanding homeless encampment linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/harrison-street-corridor/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;ongoing court battle&lt;/a&gt; — have already tested positive for the disease, the city says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The absence of confirmed human cases is reassuring but does not remove the risk of undiagnosed cases or future cases," the city's public health officer said in a Jan. 6 court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis, also called 'lepto," spreads through contact with infected water and mud, according to a &lt;a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%2012%2C%202026%20Lepto%20Health%20Alert%20Final.pdf?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;city public health alert issued Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Rats and their urine are vectors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg 600w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg 1000w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/IMG_9998.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Part of the Harrison encampment last week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/support/#become-a-scanner-insider-by-sharing-tips" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;Scanner Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the positive tests, the city has "strongly" urged encampment residents to move at least one-third of a mile away from a "red zone" where leptospirosis has been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This 1/3 mile safety buffer will be a focus of prevention activities to block the further spread," the city wrote, urging "immediate departure" from the zone. "Any items removed from encampments and exposed to mud and standing water should be disinfected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the city, the unsafe area is bounded by San Pablo Avenue, Gilman Street, Codornices Creek and the railroad tracks in &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/northwest-berkeley/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;northwest Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Current Harrison Street encampment conditions (tents, refuse, uncontained food, RVs, standing water) prevent standard vector control teams from accessing and destroying rat nesting sites," the city says. "Rodent eradication, ongoing rat testing for Leptospirosis, and remediation of the area to prevent a growing rat infestation is a medical and public health safety necessity that cannot be successfully completed while the encampment is occupied."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, city of Berkeley officials said all community members should avoid touching the water in Codornices Creek and "walking or biking through standing water" in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city said the creek has not been tested for leptospirosis — while noting that "the presence of Lepto so close to the creek means that there is also a significant risk of the disease spreading to the creek and wildlife if the nearby infected rodent population is not controlled." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/topic/uc-berkeley-crime/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; sent the city's health alert to residents of University Village on the Albany-Berkeley border on the north side of the creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg 600w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/content/images/2026/01/berkeley-leptospirosis-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leptospirosis notices are now posted in northwest Berkeley. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/support/#become-a-scanner-insider-by-sharing-tips" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="italic"&gt;Scanner Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, leptospirosis can cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/about/index.html?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as "sudden high fever, throbbing headache, severe calf/leg pain, and red eyes," according to the city. "Without treatment, leptospirosis … can progress to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, trouble breathing, and even death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And local doctors may not readily recognize it, since it is "usually associated with tropical conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals began testing positive for leptospirosis in November, the city wrote, when veterinarians found it in two sick dogs at the Harrison Street encampment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, &lt;a href="https://acvcsd.org/?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Alameda County Vector Control&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the disease's presence in neighborhood rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was of particular concern," the city wrote, because it was the first time the potentially deadly bacteria has been found in the area despite five years of testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one dog, a 5-month-old puppy, is believed to have died from leptospirosis, although the bacteria's presence was not confirmed by testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city has now launched "an ongoing public health investigation" into lepto's spread in the encampment and nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cleanup will take at least 30 days because that is how long Lepto can live in the soil," the city wrote. "Additionally, eradication of rats requires many cycles of baiting the rats with poison in their underground burrows, removing the carcasses and rebaiting over a period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials have also posted notices in the neighborhood, with the help of Alameda County Vector Control, to alert residents to the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Berkeley's &lt;a href="https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%2012%2C%202026%20Lepto%20Health%20Alert%20Final.pdf?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Jan. 12 public health alert&lt;/a&gt;, local dog owners should be sure to vaccinate their pets for leptospirosis and owners of "free roaming cats" should consider the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keep pets on a short leash; bring water on walks, do not allow them to drink from other sources," the city said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of pet illness may include "excessive thirst, vomiting, shivering, and lethargy and can progress to liver failure if untreated. Lepto can also be fatal to dogs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardeners should also take precautions, particularly if they grow fruit and vegetables: "Wear gloves and protective foot coverings, such as rubber boots. Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before consumption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other precautions such as safe food storage and "continuous disposal of garbage" can limit the spread of leptospirosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Jan. 6 court filing, the city's public health officer said an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyscanner.com/2025/06/10/community/berkeley-cant-close-harrison-homeless-camp-yet-judge-says/" rel="noreferrer"&gt;federal injunction&lt;/a&gt; stopping Berkeley from clearing the Harrison Street camp has blocked the city "from implementing fully effective eradication efforts" in its battle with leptospirosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the judge who issued that injunction last year said the time has come to resolve the matter. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a brief hearing over Zoom, &lt;a href="https://cand.uscourts.gov/judges/emc/chen-edward-m?ref=berkeleyscanner.com" rel="noreferrer"&gt;U.S. District Judge Edward M Chen&lt;/a&gt; ordered both parties, the Berkeley Homeless Union and attorneys for the city of Berkeley, to produce a series of briefs in the coming months, culminating in a March 20 hearing where he will rule on what the city must do if it hopes to clear the encampment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" I need to adjudicate this thing," Chen said. " We can get this thing closed one way or another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="kg-card kg-signup-card kg-width-wide kg-style-accent" data-lexical-signup-form=""&gt;

            Small changes in diet, exercise and sleep may extend life by a year when put into practice together, while making larger changes could provide more than nine additional years of life, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000f3b6pv58fotwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Combining changes in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/health/importance-of-exercise-sleep-wellness"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/mind-body-fitness-routine-wellness"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; also increased “health span,” or the number of years a person may live without major health complaints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000g3b6pn0yg0e5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These findings highlight the importance of considering lifestyle behaviors as a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;package rather than in isolation,” said lead study author Nick Koemel, a research fellow in physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Syndey’s main campus in Camperdown, Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “By targeting small improvements across multiple behaviors simultaneously, the required change for any single behavior is substantially reduced, which may help overcome common barriers to long-term behavior change,” Koemel said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            However, that finding is far from conclusive, said Kevin McConway, professor emeritus of applied statistics at the Open University in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000k3b6psbqix2g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A snag is that the paper uses complicated statistical methods that are not always described clearly,” McConway said in an email. “It’s therefore difficult to tell to what extent the findings have emerged from the researchers’ choice of statistical analyses, rather than things that are clearer from the data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000l3b6pabhnjycf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using scientific modeling, Koemel and his team found combining as little as five additional minutes of sleep, two minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (such as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/our-favorite-comfortable-running-shoes-releases-2025?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; or taking the stairs), and an additional ½ cup of vegetables a day might lengthen life by a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000m3b6patlvi617@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, this predicted outcome was only for people who had an extremely poor diet, slept less than &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/health/sleep-dementia-risk-study-wellness"&gt;six hours per night&lt;/a&gt; and only exercised about seven minutes a day. In addition, it wasn’t until the model’s lifestyle improvements greatly increased that the results became scientifically significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000n3b6p5pegjxt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of the gains reported in this study are theoretical,” Koemel said. “We cannot claim a direct causal effect from the lifestyle patterns. These findings should therefore be interpreted as expected or projected benefits under assumed behavioral variations, rather than confirmed effects of an intervention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000o3b6py8rov2u9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The greatest gain in longevity — 9.35 years — and health span&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— 9.46 years — came with the combination of an addition of 42 to 103 minutes of exercise and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/ozlo-sleepbuds?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;sleeping between seven and eight hours&lt;/a&gt; a day, while also eating an extremely healthy diet that included fish, whole grains, vegetables and fruits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Adding exercise to the mix moved the longevity needle the most — a fact that did not surprise preventive cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000q3b6pxmwmerk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Exercise is the elixir of youth,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the study. “But let me be clear — this study should not be interpreted as exercising for exactly two minutes and stop, you’ve accomplished a goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000r3b6p9anpywby@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Rather, you should aim to get 20 to 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/health/walking-fast-benefits-study-wellness"&gt;brisk, breathless physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, combining strength and cardio in every day. That advice has not changed over decades of study.”

            The study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eClinicalMedicine, looked at almost 60,000 participants from England, Scotland and Wales in the  &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a longitudinal health study, who were followed for an average of eight years. Everyone in the study provided information on their diet — including ultraprocessed foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages. A subset of the group also wore wrist watches that provided more objective measurements of movement and sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkczca5h000u3b6pvcbm2wfi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers gathered this medical data and used it to form theoretical scenarios of improved longevity and health span, which was defined as the number of years free of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/health/heart-disease-risk-factors-wellness"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/health/exercise-midlife-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/25/health/mediterranean-diet-type-2-diabetes-wellness"&gt;type 2 diabetes.&lt;/a&gt;

            Enjoying a longer life and a longer health span, or remaining free of disease, aren’t the same thing, Koemel said. “Combined improvements in sleep, physical activity, and diet were associated with longer lifespans, even if people still developed some chronic conditions later in life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After adjusting the findings for many variables — such as the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/aha-ultraprocessed-food-guidelines-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, insomnia, snoring and daytime sleepiness — the results differed depending on how much of each behavior change was accomplished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition to the lowest and highest levels of the lifestyle changes discussed above, researchers also found lower levels of exercise — less than 23 minutes a day — sleeping seven to eight hours a night, and an excellent diet were associated with nearly four more years of life and three years of health, the study found.

            Moderate levels of exercise (between 23 and 42 minutes a day), sleeping up to eight hours per night, and a high-quality diet were associated with a greater improvement of an additional seven years of life and just over six years of good health. So many calculations! What does it all mean?

            “This is not about the absolute minutes you exercise or sleep or the number of pieces of broccoli you eat. It’s about making sure that all the things you do in your life are synonymous with health,” Freeman said.

            “This is a great time of year to reflect on how you live and make big changes that will set you up for a life of wellness by modifying your life’s trajectory,” he said. “The overall signal in the noise is if you live well, your health span and then your lifespan will be longer.”

So simple daily activities like a brisk walk, housework or gardening will do the trick. And if we want to reduce sitting by 30 minutes a day, this can be swapped for light activities like pottering around the house or a slow walk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, a second study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00676-5/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the eClinicalMedicine journal&lt;/a&gt;, found that when combined, small improvements in sleep, physical activity, and diet were linked with a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, an extra five minutes of sleep, two minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity – such as brisk walking or taking the stairs – and an additional half a serving of vegetables a day could lead to an extra year of life for those with the worst sleep, physical activity, and dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts led by the University of Sydney gathered information on the levels of activity, diet and sleep of almost 60,000 people taking part in the UK Biobank study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Compared with people with the worst sleep, physical activity and dietary habits, the study suggested that the optimal combination of these behaviours – seven to eight hours of sleep per day, more than 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a day and a healthy diet – was associated with living almost a decade longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPM0xjLUx2WHAycy1fNjI3OGdrd3pBa3A0VzdmcWs3bVhpU3UzWFZlQ0ZWaXpIVDA3cldHY2VRRVNVd2F0WkFBZU13bzJRNklkVjVpTko3MkZZSXVyZTMtZTc1MG9OWER0TmhhLUdxbTBIbVhtaGtxMnRMaERwSk5DWDI2aWY0bDIwNWY2c01HaTBhWi0yVGZGQlg3aFdXbzNBMGxYazNkTlRJN0E4bkVNQkU5clU</guid></item><item><title>新泽西州儿童流感死亡： 2岁儿子从莫里斯敦医疗中心被送回家后，妈妈大声疾呼-纽约ABC7</title><link>https://abc7ny.com/post/nj-child-flu-death-mom-speaks-2-year-old-son-was-sent-home-morristown-medical-center/18392336/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;MORRISTOWN, New Jersey (WABC) -- &lt;/span&gt;The parents of the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7ny.com/post/flu-outbreak-nj-health-officials-report-first-pediatric-death-season-state/18378670/" target="_blank"&gt;first child to die from the flu in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; this season spoke out exclusively to Eyewitness News about their heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two-year-old Isaias Castillo's mother says the family took him to the emergency room with a fever but they were sent home -- and hours later he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Family members told Eyewitness News they believe his death could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I will never be the same, my children will never be the same, my family will never be the same, and to them it's just another number," Giselle Castillo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Castillo's 2-year-old son Isaias was the center of her world.

			&lt;p&gt;In 2024, scientists stumbled upon a potential new treatment for hereditary-patterned baldness, the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/hereditary-patterned-baldness-a-to-z"&gt;most common cause of hair loss&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583821/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on a naturally occurring sugar that helps form DNA: the '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt;' part of deoxyribonucleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying how these sugars aid &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222111437"&gt;wound healing in mice&lt;/a&gt; when applied topically, scientists at the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University in Pakistan noticed that the fur around treated lesions grew back faster than in untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/baldness-breakthrough-fat-cells-could-be-the-secret-to-rapid-hair-regrowth"&gt;Baldness Breakthrough: Fat Cells Could Be The Secret to Rapid Hair Regrowth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, the team decided to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in June 2024, they took male mice with testosterone-driven hair loss and removed the fur from their backs. Each day, researchers smeared a small dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt; sugar gel on the exposed skin, and within weeks, the fur in this region showed 'robust' regrowth, sprouting long, thick individual hairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deoxyribose gel was so effective that the team found it worked just as well as minoxidil, a topical treatment for hair loss commonly known by the brand name Rogaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth," &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/cure-male-pattern-baldness-given-boost-sugar-discovery"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; tissue engineer Sheila MacNeil from the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenic alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, is a natural condition caused by genetics, hormone levels, and aging, and it presents differently in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg" alt="male pattern baldness" class="wp-image-155531 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness presents differently in men and women. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEx62El90M/"&gt;Oleg Elkov/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disorder impacts &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/hereditary-patterned-baldness-a-to-z"&gt;up to 40 percent of the population&lt;/a&gt;, and yet the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved two drugs to treat the condition thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While over-the-counter minoxidil can work to slow hair loss and promote some regrowth, it doesn't work for all those experiencing hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If minoxidil isn't effective, then male patients can turn to finasteride (brand name Propecia) – a prescribed oral drug that inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. It's not yet approved for female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finasteride can slow hair loss in about &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/hair-loss/treatment/male-pattern-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;80 to 90 percent of male patients&lt;/a&gt;, but it needs to be taken continuously once it is started. The drug can be associated with unwanted, sometimes severe &lt;a href="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/medicines/c8584165-82ab-4a0f-8b3c-a53300ff8b32-reduced.pdf"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, such as erectile dysfunction, testicular or breast pain, reduced libido, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="188227" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The treatment of androgenetic alopecia remains challenging," MacNeil and her colleagues, led by biomaterial researcher Muhammad Anjum from COMSATS, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the team designed a biodegradable, non-toxic gel made from deoxyribose, and applied the treatment to mouse models of male-pattern baldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minoxidil was also tested on balding mouse models, and some of the animals received a dose of both sugar gel &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; minoxidil for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to mice that received a gel without any medicine, those that received a gel with deoxyribose sugar began to sprout new hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both minoxidil and the sugar gel promoted 80 to 90 percent hair regrowth in mice with male pattern baldness. Combining the treatments, however, did not make much more of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs were taken at various stages throughout the 20-day trial, and the effect is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133589" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133589" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-642x330.jpg" alt="Deoxyribose Gel" class="size-medium wp-image-133589" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-642x330.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-807x415.jpg 807w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-768x395.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-600x309.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133589" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photographs of mice with male pattern baldness at different time intervals, including mice without any treatment (NC), mouse models of male pattern baldness (T-1), gel without medicine (T-2), gel with deoxyribose sugars (T-3), minoxidil (T-4), deoxyribose sugar and minoxidil gel (T-5).

&lt;p&gt;For years, the Food and Drug Administration provided &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251218065045/https:/www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism"&gt;an informational webpage for parents&lt;/a&gt; warning them of the dangers of bogus autism treatments, some promoted by anti-vaccine activists and “wellness” companies. The page cited specifics scams and the “significant health risks” they pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has numerous ties to the wellness industry—that FDA information webpage is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism"&gt;now gone&lt;/a&gt;. It was quietly deleted at the end of last year, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to Ars Technica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defunct webpage, titled “Be Aware of Potentially Dangerous Products and Therapies that Claim to Treat Autism,” provided parents and other consumers with an overview of the problem. It began with a short description of autism and some evidence-based, FDA-approved medications that can help manage autism symptoms. Then, the regulatory agency provided a list of some false claims and unproven, potentially dangerous treatments it had been working to combat. “Some of these so-called therapies carry significant health risks,” the FDA wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list included chelation and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, treatments that those in the anti-vaccine and wellness spheres have championed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous detoxes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelation is a real treatment for heavy metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning. But it has been co-opted by anti-vaccine activists and wellness gurus, who &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/chelation-therapy"&gt;falsely claim it can treat autism&lt;/a&gt;, among other things. These sham treatments can come in a variety of forms, including sprays, suppositories, capsules, and liquid drops. Actual FDA-approved chelation therapy products are prescription only, the agency noted, and chelating certain minerals from the body “can lead to serious and life-threatening outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many anti-vaccine activists promote the false and thoroughly debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and more specifically, that trace metal components in some vaccines cause the neurological disorder. For years, anti-vaccine activists like Kennedy focused on &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/death-autistic-child-chelation-therapy-oped"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine preservative that contains ethylmercury. Thimerosal was largely removed from childhood vaccines by 2001 amid unfounded concerns. The removal made no impact on autism rates, and many studies have continued to show that it is safe and not a cause of autism. Anti-vaccine activists moved on to blame other vaccine components for autism, including &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/rfk-jr-s-loathesome-edits-cdc-website-now-falsely-links-vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in some vaccines to help spur protective immune responses. It too has been found to be safe and not linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;

The same technology used for the first &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/over-the-counter-home-coronavirus-test-ac070f4d42d9d7eacc486c9bed4ccaa0"&gt;over-the-counter coronavirus tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is now being translated into &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-covid-flu-90ee3e53ccff763a817cdbb57bc8969c"&gt;home-based kits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/syphilis-gonorrhea-std-sexually-transmitted-cdc-17c748701b8da8024f06869460b33961"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,” said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. “Now we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider’s office.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;New tests offer convenience and quicker turnaround times&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small testing device. After uploading a photo of the device, users can review the results on a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire process — from buying the test to getting a prescription — can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby’s chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,” said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approved Visby’s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That’s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hpv-test-home-cervical-cancer-fda-2ebb9d757add4cdad03809f589506c53"&gt;testing kit for HPV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company’s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases/new-cervical-cancer-screening-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Updated federal guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for HPV screening released earlier this month endorsed self collection for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;The FDA recently approved the first new gonorrhea drugs in decades&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria that causes gonorrhea has constantly evolved, developing resistance to nearly every antibiotic used to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of the two new drugs can be taken by mouth, a major advantage over the current standard of care: an injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuzolvenc, developed through a public-private partnership, comes in granules that dissolve in water. Bluejepa, from GlaxoSmithKline, is a tablet that is also approved to treat urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously recommended another drug, oral azithromycin, alongside injectable ceftriaxone, but dropped the pill from its guidance after signs that gonorrhea was growing resistant to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,” said Park. “So to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;The new tests and drugs come as STD rates are falling again&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;provisional data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point to several factors behind the trend, including less sexual activity among young people, increased use of an antibiotic as a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/doxycycline-std-morning-after-pill-cdc-20a087e32c4a81f7c3413363e6255785"&gt;morning-after pill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to prevent infections and more at-home screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tests could drive further reductions, although some experts urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more people test at home it could become harder to track national infection rates, which previously have been reported by a handful of large testing laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the new tests and drugs come with higher price tags that may limit access. For example, Visby’s $150 test is not covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to that recent Trump administration funding cuts to the CDC and other public health agencies and there could be more challenges on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I’m feeling very optimistic about the fact that people have more testing options and also that we now have access to new drugs.” Park said. “What I fear is these cuts to public health are going to decrease access to sexual health care for populations who can least afford to take advantage of these new options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

                &lt;p&gt;The International Space Station (ISS) is one of the most unique environments where life has ever existed, out in the low orbit of Earth. And research out today finds that bacteriophages—the viruses that prey on bacteria—can behave quite peculiarly in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists studied how phages interacted with &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria aboard the ISS and compared them to pairs grown on Earth. The space-dwelling phages took longer to infect their hosts, while both the bacteria and viruses developed unusual mutations in response to each other and the microgravity conditions of the ISS, they found. The findings also suggest that phages in space could develop mutations useful to humans back home.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Microbes continue to evolve under microgravity, and they do so in ways that are not always predictable from Earth-based experiments,” senior study author Vatsan Raman, a biomolecular and cellular engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Phages in space&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have documented that many microbes and other tiny living things can thrive aboard the ISS, including the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-international-space-station-is-a-cesspool-of-bacter-1833885488"&gt;microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; left behind by touring astronauts. But according to Raman, there’s been relatively little research examining how these space microbes interact with each other, especially phages and the bacteria they infect to make more of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most microbial evolution experiments implicitly assume Earth-like physical conditions, but spaceflight changes fundamental aspects of the environment—how fluids mix, how cells encounter one another, and how physical forces shape cellular physiology,” he explained. “Phage infection depends critically on transport, encounter rates, and host physiology, all of which could plausibly change in space. We wanted to test whether microgravity simply slows these processes down, or whether it pushes phages and bacteria along different evolutionary paths altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They focused on a particular kind of phage that loves to munch on &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, known as T7.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ISS phages were slower to infect their prey at first, likely because fluids don’t mix the same way under microgravity conditions, according to Raman. But once infection occurred, both the phages and bacteria rapidly adapted and often very differently from their Earth counterparts. The bacteria evolved in ways that seemed to boost their defenses against phage infection and enhance their survivability in space, while the phages evolved to more easily infect &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. What’s more, some of the genetic changes seen in the space phages were unlike anything seen on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that microgravity doesn’t just delay phage infection—it reshapes how phages and bacteria evolve together,” Raman said. “We observed mutations appearing in unexpected genes, including ones that are poorly characterized in standard laboratory settings.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://plos.io/4q4S9AO"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in PLOS Biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What this means&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings obviously have implications for space travel, especially longer-duration missions. The microbes living aboard the ISS and other space stations in the future aren’t just static tourists, and it’s certainly possible they could evolve in ways that have a real impact on the health of astronauts and the environment in general, Raman says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That scary possibility aside, space phages could also help humanity. The team’s experiments on Earth found that several of the changes seen aboard the ISS made the phages better at attacking T7-resistant strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that cause urinary tract infections in people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phages are already being developed as an alternative treatment for drug-resistant infections. And while it would be impractical to routinely run these sorts of experiments on the ISS, learning exactly how microgravity can shape the evolution of these microbes could allow scientists like Raman to apply those lessons to studies conducted on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I hope this work encourages researchers to think of space not just as a place to reproduce Earth experiments, but as a fundamentally different physical environment that can uncover new biology—insights that ultimately circle back to improve research and applications here on Earth,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers now hope to better understand the specific genes and mutations in T7 phages that emerged under microgravity, particularly the ones not easily created in a standard lab. They also hope that similar studies in the future will reveal how space can change the biology of more complex microbial communities or medically relevant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Not surprisingly, bacteriophages, a name meaning to "eaters of bacteria," are found everywhere, shaping the microbial ecosystems in oceans, soils and even our bodies. But one place where phages may have the most human impact is as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asm.org/articles/2022/august/phage-therapy-past,-present-and-future" target="_blank" data-url="https://asm.org/articles/2022/august/phage-therapy-past,-present-and-future" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;possible treatment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against antibiotic resistant bacteria and other bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These phages work as tiny "delivery systems" wrapped in proteins. But unlike a delivery person giving a delicious pizza, some phages (like the T7 phage used in this study) infect bacteria by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493185/#:~:text=During%20a%20lytic%20replication%20cycle,Function" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493185/#:~:text=During%20a%20lytic%20replication%20cycle,Function" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attaching to a specific surface feature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the cell — often a molecule embedded in the bacterial cell's outer membranes — and injecting its genetic material. Once inside, the phage hijacks the bacteria's machinery to make many copies of itself. Finally, it explodes the bacterial cell and releases a new wave of phage particles that can infect nearby bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This specific attack process by the phage then kicks off an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1588396&amp;amp;xcust=space_us_1247997994724947447&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-019-1894-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.space.com%2Fspace-exploration%2Finternational-space-station%2Fviruses-may-be-more-powerful-in-the-international-space-stations-microgravity-environment" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1894-8" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1588396&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-019-1894-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.space.com%2Fspace-exploration%2Finternational-space-station%2Fviruses-may-be-more-powerful-in-the-international-space-stations-microgravity-environment" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;evolutionary arms race&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between phages and bacteria, as bacteria can evolve resistance to these attacks by changing or hiding the phage's "landing pad" found on the cell's surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And things only get more complicated when microgravity gets involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KChtj9a6iYvHzcozL2xGQg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KChtj9a6iYvHzcozL2xGQg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="8b480608-e8cf-430d-a1c9-6d383acdd184"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A diagram showing the full lytic cycle of some phages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: University of Barcelona, CC BY 3.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7c8d105b-886f-4adb-bd2d-b1eae75b1b3d" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-virus-bacteria-showdown-in-orbit-3"&gt;A virus-bacteria showdown in orbit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="557e1c2d-f271-4902-b2f7-721281ad12ba"&gt;To study how microgravity affects this process, the researchers used a bacteriophage called T7 and its bacterial prey, &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli, &lt;/em&gt;or what is more commonly known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/e-coli" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/e-coli" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To isolate the effects of microgravity as cleanly as possible, the team prepared two identical sets of sample tubes of the bacteria, unshaken, and incubated at the same temperature for one, two or four hours, and a longer period of 23 days. One set of tubes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/antares-cygnus-cargo-ship-ng-13-launch-success.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/antares-cygnus-cargo-ship-ng-13-launch-success.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;went to the ISS in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, carried by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/northrop-grumman-space-systems.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/northrop-grumman-space-systems.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s NG-13 &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/cygnus-spacecraft.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/cygnus-spacecraft.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cygnus spacecraft&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while the other stayed below on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The experiment had to work within strict NASA constraints: sealed cryovials had to pass biocompatibility and leak testing, withstand multiple freeze–thaw cycles, and remain safe to handle on orbit," Huss explained. "The sample size is much lower than what we are used to terrestrially and designing an experiment around this is challenging!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also varied the starting ratios of phage to &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; so that some samples having more phage would be expected to be infected quickly while others would take longer and show stronger dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the two experiments couldn't run in perfect parallel, the team recorded the exact incubation times on the ISS and then matched them on Earth afterward, a common workaround for many ISS biological experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-227c18a7-df37-4661-981a-baed09582909" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="microgravity-slows-down-interactions-3"&gt;Microgravity slows down interactions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9a82dd61-c203-47c5-be5f-e0f8d69119d4"&gt;Under typical Earth lab conditions, the T7 phages can infect and kill &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; cells in well under an hour, given the&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/3916" target="_blank" data-url="https://viralzone.expasy.org/3916" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt; life cycle of the phage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But in the system's completely sealed and shake-free setup, which mimicked the conditions of microgravity, the system moved more slowly overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Earth, the control group showed a surge in bacterial infections between two and four hours, but in microgravity, the surge didn't appear at any of the shorter incubation periods, suggesting that the phages' infection process &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111596?" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111596?" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;had slowed down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, the longer incubation vials told a different story, as after 23 days in orbit, the infection process was successful with fewer &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;found in the vials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do the researchers think the slowdown happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hypothesize that reduced fluid mixing in microgravity, because there's no gravity-driven convection, lowers the encounter rate between phage and bacteria, and that microgravity-induced stress on the host may alter receptor expression or intracellular processes, further slowing productive infection," Huss added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, in microgravity, phages and bacteria don't bump into each other as often and the bacteria may have evolved to be more resistant to phage attacks that make infection harder, so the entire cycle starts later than it does on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="d06c2367-f07f-466a-b665-25ad4bc3f6e6"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A structural model of bacteriophage T7 at atomic scale. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Dr. Victor Padilla-Sanchez, PhD, CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-d5ea1371-d92b-418c-8ef2-76aef86fd547" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="microgravity-mutations-3"&gt;Microgravity mutations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="68b54100-f173-4032-9b5b-cc18209cf5b0"&gt;After 23 days, the team analyzed the genetic make-up of the phages and saw mutations across its genome, but with microgravity-specific mutations, especially in genes tied to structure and host interaction. These mutations changed how the phage infects the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me one of the most striking findings was not just that mutations appeared across the phage genome, but that microgravity pushed evolution into corners of the phage we still don't fully understand," Huss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, microgravity may not just change how &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; infection happens but also which of a virus's genes &lt;em&gt;matter most&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to successfully infecting a bacterial host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just beginning to scratch the surface," Dr. Srivatsan Raman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, another lead author on the study, told Space.com. "We just have to do more experiments with more complex conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phages weren't the only ones to change, as the bacteria seemed to evolve too. The &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; exposed to the phages accumulated many more mutations than bacteria without phage threats, consistent with selection pressure that drives evolutionary arms races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most notable changes hit genes linked to the outer membranes, potentially altering phage attachment while helping bacteria survive stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microgravity doesn't just slow things down, it qualitatively reshapes phage–host coevolution, from infection dynamics to the specific genes and mutations that matter," Huss noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-faa01243-6db7-48cc-8210-6551f5c0c97d" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="microgravity-as-a-way-forward-for-earth-based-medicine-3"&gt;Microgravity as a way forward for Earth-based medicine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c99fc988-007b-49b4-9472-29ca6c46c83e"&gt;Using a technique called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111596?" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1111596?" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deep mutational scanning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team scanned for over 1,600 mutation variants in the phage genome, finding that the "winning" mutations in microgravity differed sharply from those on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results support microgravity as a &lt;em&gt;distinct &lt;/em&gt;selection environment that reveals different parts of the fitness landscape than we can capture terrestrially," said Huss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used these mutations to create altered phages which they tested on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10537683/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10537683/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uropathogenic &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; associated with urinary tract infections — that were more resistant to the T7 phages' attacks. The results showed that these altered viruses could kill the resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found in the study was that phage mutants that were enriched in microgravity could treat uropathic bacteria and kill them. So, which tells us that there's something about the microgravity condition that makes it relevant for treating pathogens on Earth," Raman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has big implications for possible future treatments of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://imb.uq.edu.au/common-bacterial-diseases" target="_blank" data-url="https://imb.uq.edu.au/common-bacterial-diseases" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bacterial diseases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here on Earth, from salmonella poisoning to pneumonia to sepsis. But conducting the further testing required to get there may be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Running these experiments on the ISS, that's not trivial," Raman added. "I mean, that takes years of planning, and there's just a lot of logistical challenges to get through. To run these experiments, pulling them off in a routine manner would actually be a little challenging to execute."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="31e6fb65-c63f-4682-9621-097e8435bbdb"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;An image of &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;bacteria under the microscope. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: NIAID)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-11472f76-a3f8-4e87-89f0-f96af995b25c" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-the-future-of-spaceflight-3"&gt;What about the future of spaceflight? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c3f5b17b-fa5f-423e-9a4d-34971171a37b"&gt;Zooming from the microscopic to the macroscopic, these results suggest that space microbes won't stay static but instead adapt and evolve in microgravity-specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What our data makes clear is that microbes can adapt rapidly and in unexpected ways in microgravity," Huss added. "In principle, those same pressures could enrich traits we worry about on Earth, including drug resistance or altered virulence. This is a plausible evolutionary trajectory that future experiments should actively test by monitoring antibiotic susceptibility, stress responses, and competitive interactions over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could these adaptations truly be a threat for humans on long-term space missions? Possibly, but for Raman, more testing is needed before that conclusion could be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pathogens evolve all the time," Raman said. "I think we ought to do more studies to see if bacteria can evolve towards mutations that might make them more pathogenic under microgravity conditions. Those are not experiments that we've actually done in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But bacteria are very resilient and they evolve all the time. So I wouldn't rule out the possibility, but again, one has to do these rigorous experiments to ask: can a bacteria become a pathogen under ISS conditions?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such area of future space research could be looking at the human microbiome, as it's still not well understood how the microbiome evolves in the conditions of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For humans on Earth, the results of this study are more positive, as microgravity could help scientists to develop phages that can kill off more resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real power of these space-derived fitness landscapes is that they don't stand alone. They can be merged with the rich terrestrial datasets we already have to sharpen engineering strategies for therapeutic use cases. That's arguably the most immediately actionable takeaway," said Huss.&lt;/p&gt;

But then there are other things that significantly reduce risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;What exactly does this mean, in terms of making changes then? Professor Mummery went on to explain that exercise, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/mental-health"&gt;mental&lt;/a&gt; exercise and a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;healthy&lt;/a&gt; diet are key to avoiding certain types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Professor Catherine Mummery expressed the importance of these three things (This Morning/ITV)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"So, exercise, making sure that you get regular physical exercise three times a week, get out of breath. That’s a good plan," she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Second thing is mental exercise - doesn’t have to be a brain game. It can be anything that you really enjoy that stretches you, that makes you feel like you’re doing something new. Whatever works for you, it can be many different things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And last, but certainly not least important, the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; expert explained the importance of a healthy diet, containing 'vegetables, lots of fresh food,' while avoiding 'processed stuff and too much sugar.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"And those things together will really help in terms of trying to reduce that risk of you getting any form of dementia, not just vascular dementia," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some of the other ways to help reduce the risk of dementia, according &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; The Alzheimer's Society, are to cut down on alcohol consumption, smoking, and manage long-term health conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 18:23:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPSUVfVFJTNTVpUURBb0hmUHdxYlhRQWt0RXFGMnhwVnFmOVVCYWhDNUROcE1lUl9PWTVMUmhYSXI5SVI5ejJXZl95Q0dOc0FRcl9ublFyVHZoaVBFVEJZQ0EyZC00MWFjNi03TWVvVGhzOGRRZ2FvM3hUQjRPaXdlSGxLWVFwcUVkMDhwZmd5NXBmY2ZzTkdrMDRxeE5tYk1jWUdjMWJ3OA</guid></item><item><title>大鼠传播疾病在伯克利报道，卫生官员警告-补丁</title><link>https://patch.com/california/berkeley/rat-borne-disease-reported-berkeley-health-officials-warn</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BERKELEY, CA — Leptospirosis, a treatable but potentially deadly rat-borne disease, has been detected in and around a homeless encampment in Berkeley, public health officials announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous rats and at least two dogs tested positive in 2025 for leptospirosis at the homeless encampments on Harrison Street, just south of Albany and UC Berkeley's University Village, public health officials announced Monday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berkeley's Health Officer, Noemi Doohan, issued an alert on Monday, recommending that encampment residents move out of an area they're calling a red zone bound by San Pablo Avenue, Gilman Street, Codornices Creek and the Berkeley railroad tracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any items removed from encampments and exposed to mud and standing water should be disinfected," Doohan said in the alert.

                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Do you get care at a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/mtf"&gt;military hospital or clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Starting Jan. 20, you’ll be able to access lab results, radiology reports, pathology reports, and clinical notes immediately through the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login" target="_blank"&gt;MHS GENESIS Patient Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. MHS GENESIS will release your electronic health information the moment it enters the system. This change is a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, a federal law that gives you faster access to your health information.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This change puts you in control of your health care,” said Dr. Paul Doan, Chief, Specialty Care Policy Support, at the Defense Health Agency. “You’ll get your results sooner, which helps you ask your health care team better questions and decide the care that’s best for you or your family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;What this means for you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Starting Jan. 20, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal will send you a notification when new results or notes are available. Sometimes, this may mean you see your results before your care team reviews them. You’ll need to verify that an active email account is associated with your patient portal to get these notifications. Check your settings to verify your email address.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you log in to view results, you’ll see a banner. The banner will explain that your provider or care team may not have reviewed them yet. Your provider will contact you if your results need further discussion or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you should know&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results appear quickly.&lt;/b&gt; The system releases information right away. You might see your results before your provider does. Your provider will reach out about anything that requires immediate attention. If you have any questions about your results, contact your provider.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take time to review.&lt;/b&gt; Read your results carefully. The patient portal may include explanations for certain values or findings. Reach out to your provider or care team if something confuses you or seems unexpected.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some results may be sensitive.&lt;/b&gt; You might view emotionally difficult results before speaking with your provider. Your provider or care team can walk you through what the findings mean and discuss next steps.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can choose when to view your results.&lt;/b&gt; Do you want to discuss results with your provider first? You can wait to open them in the patient portal until your provider contacts you or until your next visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this change matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Federal law requires health systems to give patients real-time access to their electronic health information. This change improves transparency. It enables faster, more informed conversations about your care. You gain more control over your health information.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Reach out to your provider or care team for context, next steps, or follow-up care. They’re here to help you understand your results and support you through your health care journey.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start viewing your results in 2026, visit the &lt;a href="https://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/identitymanagement/app/login" target="_blank"&gt;MHS GENESIS Patient Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The healthiest peanut butter has a short ingredient list, consisting of just peanuts and possibly salt.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please be cautious of added sugars in peanut butter, as they can accumulate over time.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose natural peanut butter without hydrogenated oils, even if it separates. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peanut butter has long been a comforting staple in the American pantry. Beyond the usual 7 grams of protein per 2 tablespoons,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; peanut butter can come with a lot of added sugars and saturated fats, including palm oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find the healthiest option, we consulted with registered dietitians about what “healthy” actually means for this tasty spread. The answer is simple: something that has just peanuts and salt, and nothing more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-a-short-ingredient-list-is-best"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. A Short Ingredient List Is Best &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians agree: the shorter the ingredient list, the healthier the peanut butter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“The healthiest peanut butter is going to focus on the peanuts themselves,” &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/grace-a-derocha" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Grace A. Derocha, MBA, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Verywell. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because peanuts naturally contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-that-are-high-in-unsaturated-fats-697736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/plant-protein-vs-animal-protein-8781023" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt;, fiber, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/micronutrients-7481856" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;micronutrients like magnesium and vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, there’s little need for added ingredients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-watch-for-added-sugars"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Watch for Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many commercial peanut butters contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/cane-sugar-vs-high-fructose-corn-syrup-11779767" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars, such as cane sugar&lt;/a&gt;, molasses, or corn syrup. While the amounts may seem low at first, they can add up over time if you’re eating peanut butter regularly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Agave, real 100% maple syrup, or honey may sound healthier, but as far as calories and metabolism go, it all still counts as added sugar in the body, said Derocha.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-skip-the-reduced-fat-varieties"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Skip the Reduced Fat Varieties &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reduced-fat or fat-free peanut butters can also be misleading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“If you're trying to watch out for your heart health, you don't necessarily have to get a low-fat peanut butter,” &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/julie-stefanski" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julie Stefanski, MEd, RDN, LDN, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Verywell. Those butters often compensate by adding more sugar or additives. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Peanuts are naturally fatty—in a good way. Instead of focusing solely on the fat content, consider how much sugar or salt has been added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/sodium-sodium-or-salt-sodium-functions-sodium-and-diet-5085108" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium (salt)&lt;/a&gt;, try staying in the 5% to 10% daily value range and compare labels to find the lowest option, said Stefanski. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-consider-natural-peanut-butter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Consider 'Natural' Peanut Butter &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the label “natural” is not regulated by the FDA, it generally indicates fewer additives, notably less use of hydrogenated oils, which are used for texture and shelf stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's a good place to start, according to Derocha and Stefanski.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the past, they would use hydrogenation, which means that you chemically change the fat in order to stabilize it and make it firm. But we found that that’s not really the best for health,” said Stefanski.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s best to avoid hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated fats altogether if possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When a peanut butter separates over time, leaving a layer of oil on top that needs to be mixed in, it’s a sign of minimal processing. It indicates that no emulsifiers or stabilizers are holding it together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“If you look at the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/which-foods-contain-trans-fats-697735" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;trans fat&lt;/a&gt;, you really want that to be zero, because we now don’t recognize these as safe anymore for consumption,” said Stefanski.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-does-buying-organic-matter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Does Buying Organic Matter? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutritionally speaking, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-peanut-butter-good-for-you-8759513" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;organic peanut butter&lt;/a&gt; is not necessarily superior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Organic refers to how the peanuts were grown—the farming practices or the pesticide use—not the nutrition of the peanut butter itself," said Stefanski.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You could have an organic peanut butter that has added sugar, emulsifiers, and other unnecessary oils,” added Stefanski.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s why dietitians emphasize comparing ingredient lists rather than relying on labels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-a-better-way-to-add-sweetness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; A Better Way to Add Sweetness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If plain peanut butter isn't for you, it's better to add sweetness yourself and stay in control of how much added sugar you’re getting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You could mix in your own honey, syrup, or agave,” said Derocha. Sprinkling cinnamon on a tablespoon or a splash of vanilla to your peanut butter shake can also help sweeten the flavor profile without adding extra sugars.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common parasite known for silently embedding itself in the brain has revealed a new survival strategy: hijacking the very immune cells meant to destroy it. But scientists at UVA Health have found that an enzyme inside those cells (&lt;strong&gt;caspase-8) &lt;/strong&gt;can shut the infection down by triggering the cell’s own death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research sheds light on how the body protects itself from &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a parasite estimated to infect nearly a third of the global population. While it rarely causes symptoms in healthy individuals, it can become deadly for those with compromised immune systems. The new findings explain why some immune responses fail and how the body keeps this chronic invader under control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; typically enters the body through contaminated food or cat exposure, spreading through tissues before establishing a lasting presence in the brain. The University of Virginia research team, led by &lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/neuroscience/faculty/primary-faculty/tajie-h-harris-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tajie Harris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, discovered that the parasite is capable of infecting &lt;strong&gt;CD8+ T cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which are usually tasked with destroying infected cells. Understanding how these cells resist infection, or fail to, has implications for treating at-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Immune Cells Are Not Immune to the Parasite&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harris’s team observed a surprising behavior: CD8+ T cells, normally the body’s first line of defense against infected cells, could themselves become infected by &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;. According to the research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adz4468" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, infected T cells in mice without caspase-8 allowed the parasite to replicate and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We found that these very T cells can get infected, and, if they do, they can opt to die,&lt;/em&gt;” Harris explained in a UVA Health report. That self-destruction, initiated by caspase-8, prevents the parasite from completing its life cycle, effectively cutting off its survival route.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In mice lacking caspase-8, the parasite’s presence in the &lt;strong&gt;brain &lt;/strong&gt;soared. Despite generating a strong immune response, those mice became seriously ill and died, their brains filled with infected T cells. By contrast, mice with functioning caspase-8 survived, their immune cells clearing the infection effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of Caspase-8 in Brain Defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The enzyme &lt;strong&gt;caspase-8&lt;/strong&gt; is best known for initiating &lt;strong&gt;apoptosis&lt;/strong&gt;, a self-destruct program within cells. But its role in immune defense, especially in the brain, has only recently come into focus. According to UVA researchers, mice engineered to lack this enzyme showed an &lt;strong&gt;eightfold increase&lt;/strong&gt; in brain parasite load compared to their normal counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study used advanced genetic models, including mice with CD8+ T cell-specific deletions of caspase-8, to track how the parasite interacts with different cell types. Infected T cells from these models carried &lt;strong&gt;multiple parasites&lt;/strong&gt;, sometimes even hosting clusters of replicating organisms inside a single immune cell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite high levels of immune signaling molecules like &lt;strong&gt;interferon-gamma&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;TNF-alpha&lt;/strong&gt;, the absence of caspase-8 allowed the infection to persist and worsen. This highlighted the enzyme’s importance not just for initiating cell death, but for actively limiting the spread of pathogens inside the immune system’s own ranks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Only One Cell Type Relies on This Suicide Switch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; was found in other brain cells (&lt;strong&gt;neurons&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;astrocytes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;microglia&lt;/strong&gt;) the loss of caspase-8 in those cell types didn’t significantly change parasite levels or affect disease progression. The key vulnerability lay specifically within the &lt;strong&gt;CD8+ T cells&lt;/strong&gt;, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further confirm this, the team tested mice with targeted deletion of &lt;strong&gt;Fas&lt;/strong&gt;, a death receptor known to activate caspase-8. These &lt;strong&gt;Fas-deficient mice&lt;/strong&gt; also developed high parasite loads and died sooner than normal mice, underscoring the pathway’s role in parasite control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, funded by multiple NIH grants and supported by the University of Virginia’s &lt;strong&gt;BIG Center&lt;/strong&gt;, suggests that &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; might be exploiting a narrow window in the immune response: when T cells are infected but haven’t yet triggered caspase-8. “&lt;em&gt;The only pathogens that can live in CD8+ T cells have developed ways to mess with caspase-8 function,&lt;/em&gt;” Harris noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery that a parasite can turn the immune system against itself, and that a single enzyme can turn the tide, opens new questions about how other infections might exploit similar pathways. For now, this research marks a major step in decoding how the brain fights one of its most stealthy intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

However, youth, a good physical appearance, and lack of symptoms do not indicate that the heart is functioning perfectly. Chances are that these individuals’ risk factors were never identified,” says Dr Pratik.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Giri, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the most common underlying risk. “This involves a gradual build-up of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/cholesterol" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cholesterol"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and fatty material on the walls of the arteries."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds, “In the early stages, the disease passes unnoticed. When the arterial blockage is less than 50%, there are usually no symptoms. Mild discomfort may appear only during extreme exertion, and symptoms at rest show up only when the blockage exceeds 70%. So, a young person may feel perfectly fine until a plaque ruptures suddenly, leading to a major &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://ijmr.org.in/burden-of-sudden-death-in-young-adults-a-one-year-observational-study-at-a-tertiary-care-centre-in-india/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2026/01/02/550x309/New_Project_1767356647860_1767356654414.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Lifestyle changes increase heart risks among youth, including smoking, poor diet, and stress.

(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What lifestyle factors increase the risk of heart disease in youth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes over the years have increased risks among young people. “&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/smoking" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Smoking"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt;, e-cigarettes, drug abuse like cocaine or marijuana, poor eating habits, obesity, physical inactivity, stress, irregular sleep patterns, and excessive alcohol consumption all accelerate the deterioration of heart artery health. Certain medications can also trigger sudden spasms or arrhythmias,” Dr Giri notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart failure symptoms are often overlooked in the youth. “Problems with breathing, sweating, dizziness, discomfort, nausea, or a heart-related pinch in the chest are sometimes mistaken for acidity or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/anxiety" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. This delays hospital visits and can worsen outcomes,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Giri stresses that young individuals with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, a history of smoking or substance abuse, sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, high stress levels, poor sleep, or a family history of premature heart disease should undergo regular heart check-ups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How heart attacks and heart failure be prevented early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prevention begins by identifying risks early. Basic screening tests like &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, blood sugar, and cholesterol checks should be done regularly. Depending on risk factors, doctors may recommend ECG, echocardiography, or treadmill stress tests. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Advanced non-invasive tests such as CT Coronary Calcium Scoring and CT Coronary Angiography are also very useful for detecting hidden blockages before an attack occurs,” Dr Giri advises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concludes, “Heart disease can largely be prevented. Exercise, a balanced diet, sound sleep, stress management, avoidance of tobacco and drugs, and periodic health check-ups are the foundations of a healthy heart. Early screening saves lives and helps prevent sudden heart attacks. Prevention should always start early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BERLIN — Decongestant nasal sprays can save you from a restless night when a cold clogs up your nose, but pharmacists warn this aid can be a slippery slope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaflet that comes with it will – if you read it – tell you that a decongestant spray should not be used for longer than seven days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacist Alexander Schmitz advises even more caution. He said anyone with a blocked nose should give it up after four to five days and use a moisturizing seawater-based spray instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the nasal mucosa quickly adapts to decongestant active ingredients, which cause the blood vessels in the lining to constrict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point you can’t breathe without the spray, so you have to make sure you always have it with you,” says Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmacist said he repeatedly encounters people who have developed a nasal spray dependency. Coming off it can be hard, he says. “After all, everyone wants to be able to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a nasal spray after your cold has gone also has other unwanted effects. Over time, decongestant sprays dry out the nasal mucosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This not only risks bleeding, but also greater susceptibility to infection, because pathogens can penetrate more easily,” Schmitz explains. Important protective functions of the nose then work only to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to wean the nasal lining off decongestant sprays? The classic tip is to switch first to a children’s version, which contains less active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the nose has adjusted to the lower dose, the next step is to switch to a seawater nasal spray that contains no active ingredient at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plan does not always work. “Many have had this adaptation for years. Then those are steps that are too big,” said Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case he advised seeking help at a pharmacy. “We can dilute the nasal spray. Then you wean yourself off in really tiny steps until you eventually reach 0.0%, that is the seawater nasal spray.” How long this takes depends on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with decongestant sprays, seawater sprays don’t bring the risk of the nasal lining becoming dependent, since these simply have a moisturizing effect.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Huffington Post that 'many' of her clients have reported similar challenges when it comes to intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The expert said that people believe having a big penis often means they're amazing in bed, which 'puts a lot of pressure...to perform and give their partner an out-of-this-world orgasm'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;She explained: "On one hand, they feel pressure to live up to the societal expectations of impressive sexual performances, and on the other, they are worried about hurting their partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This can lead to them avoiding sex altogether, though Dr. Rod Mitchell, a registered psychologist who specialises in sex therapy and trauma recovery, says that some men with seven inches or more downstairs can have trauma due to causing partners pain during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Some men develop trauma from causing sexual partners pain (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He said it's an 'empathic injury' which can build up over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr. Mitchell went on: "Every time your partner winces or says ‘wait, that hurts,’ you’re absorbing a micro-trauma. These men carry around the weight of having hurt someone they love, over and over, with their own body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He said that performance anxiety is actually a trauma response, as your nervous system is stopping you from causing harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doctor went on: "Your body treats repeated sexual discomfort or pain as a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Guilt rewires your brain to see intimacy as dangerous, then anxiety kicks in before sex even starts, triggering a stress response that redirects blood away from your genitals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He pointed out that some may finish within seconds as the body tries to escape this threat, with the 'failure' to perform causing more shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:59:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQZmVucHRGcFd6VHZCR2hYdG1RVzBoUHNTS051dFFrYjRucF9CVmk2RmY0YUxWMDFOaGR5dzhnTFZGNFdIb3k1aUFNbkxCM2N1UVBxM1lJSHc0ZzhxMksxajFVVUlBMHlGXzJZalhGd2JUQmNUcmpYSUFBX19pTXRoT3RELXQzY0hzQi1LRGRmUUctbzlfTWdSQi1R</guid></item><item><title>如何提高疫苗接种率：一项大型研究提供了线索-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00092-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00092-z/d41586-026-00092-z_51926520.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00092-z/d41586-026-00092-z_51926520.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Bruno Lage, Manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, gives a thumbs up as he receives his COVID-19 Booster Vaccination" loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00092-z/d41586-026-00092-z_51926520.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Bruno Lage, then-manager of the football team Wolverhampton Wanderers, receives his COVID-19 vaccination in December 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Jack Thomas - WWFC/Wolves via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some people were initially hesitant to be vaccinated against &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-020-03437-4/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, many did eventually go on to get at least one dose, according to a study of more than one million people in the United Kingdom&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from the REACT study, which tracked the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England and collected data on demographics, health and behaviour during the first two years of the pandemic. The authors linked the information to subsequent vaccine uptake using participants’ National Health Service (NHS) records. They analysed the records of 1.1 million people sampled between January 2021, when questions about vaccination status and attitudes were added to the survey, and March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the study, almost 38,000 people reported some form of vaccine hesitancy, a rate of 3.3%. Rates of hesitancy peaked at 8% in early 2021 and hit a low of 1.1% at the start of 2022, before rebounding to 2.2%. But 65% of those who were initially hesitant went on to get one or more vaccinations later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01771-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00092-z/d41586-026-00092-z_51091730.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Chadeau-Hyam, a computational epidemiologist at Imperial College London who led the study, which was published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt; on Monday, says the reasons for hesitancy could be grouped into eight broad clusters, including concerns about the vaccine’s efficacy and side effects, difficulties with travelling to vaccination sites, lack of trust in vaccine makers and personal health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve identified here could help improve adherence to vaccination quicker if we target the right people,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Addressing concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy related to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03992-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03992-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;vaccine efficacy and health concerns&lt;/a&gt;, and people who reported those worries were most likely to go on to get vaccinated. But “some of the stickier reasons, such as those related to a lack of trust in medicine, are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03790-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03790-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;more difficult to overcome&lt;/a&gt;”, says Chadeau-Hyam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that hesitancy — and persistent failure to get vaccinated — was more common in people living in economically deprived areas, those who were unemployed and those with a low level of education. Women were also more likely to be hesitant than men, but less likely to remain unvaccinated after expressing hesitancy, perhaps because some of their reasons for hesitancy, such as being pregnant or breastfeeding, were time-limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chadeau-Hyam hopes the results will help with the roll-out of future vaccines, by focusing efforts on people whose hesitancy is rooted in concrete concerns that can be allayed with the right information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Noni MacDonald, a paediatric infectious-disease specialist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, doubts that the results of this study will be much use outside the context of a pandemic. “It’s a beautifully done study on an incredible data set, but it is also a very specific context that is not so relevant now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Certain breakfast cereals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A bowl of fibre-filled cereal has long been touted as a healthy start to the day, but many packaged versions are loaded with more than just grains like corn, wheat, oats and rice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Breakfast cereals are often marketed with health halos, with words like 'wholegrain', 'energy' or 'fortified' which give the impression of a nutrient-rich meal," explains nutritionist Rob Hobson, author of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon UK;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ee9b4694-91af-4476-bd66-52f71d265624&amp;amp;siteId=uk-style&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=33a3aeda-525d-4c6a-8341-0c08ff439b74&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=Amazon+UK&amp;amp;linkText=Unprocess+Your+Life&amp;amp;custData=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&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAcG71NRa9kIyzSkRdkPmoml8oeDz4waJHeCKWof8wNXI&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FUnprocess-Your-Life-cookbook-ultra-processed%2Fdp%2F0008664471&amp;amp;spaceId=1197784495" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Unprocess Your Life;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon UK;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Unprocess Your Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"However, many popular cereals still contain high amounts of added sugar and very little fibre, which means they won’t keep you satisfied for long."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, popular children’s cereals Kellogg's Frosties and Crunchy Nut contain 11 grams of sugar per 30-gram serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is a time of day when you should aim to get a good portion of your nutritional intake with wholegrains, dairy and fruits," Hobson advises. "If you enjoy eating cereals, flip the pack and look for one with a high fibre content and low sugar levels that support stable energy across the morning."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="2-flavoured-yoghurts"&gt;2. Flavoured yoghurts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Swapping cake and biscuits for a fruit yoghurt seems like a health upgrade, but the packaging of these dessert options can be seriously misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Low-fat or virtually fat-free yoghurts can look like a lighter choice, but many rely on added sugars or sweetened fruit purées to make up for the flavour lost when you remove the fat," warns Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"While they still offer a source of beneficial calcium, this health benefit is often offset by the additives and sugar content," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You don’t have to cut out yoghurt entirely, though, as there are healthy do-it-yourself alternatives. Hobson recommends choosing a natural Greek yoghurt and adding your own chopped fruit, nuts and honey for a sweet but nutritious kick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While natural Greek yoghurt is good for you, flavoured low-fat versions can be high in sugar and additives.

They can absolutely be useful for convenience or reducing your meat intake, but the key is variety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He continues: "Relying on them on a daily basis may mean you’re missing out on whole-food proteins like beans, lentils or tofu, which are a much more nutritious way to get your protein on a plant-based diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="4-protein-bars"&gt;4. Protein bars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With so many of us looking to build a lean, muscular physique at the gym, the term 'protein' has fast become one of the most persuasive buzzwords in the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"A lot of the colourful protein bars you find near the tills are actually closer to confectionery, though," warns Hobson. "The protein they contain is often partnered with sugar syrups, flavourings or sweeteners, and some 'natural' bars have glucose syrup and chocolate listed as the main ingredients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While they’re fine as an occasional snack or for post-gym convenience, Hobson says you should think of them as treat foods, rather than healthy staples that can be eaten regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"As a good rule of thumb, you should look for a bar that has at least 15 grams of protein and minimal added sugars," he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein bars are easy to grab and snack on when you're famished between meetings or on the go, but they're often packed with sugar.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The flu has so far caused 66 deaths, including &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-pediatric-death-influenza/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-pediatric-death-influenza/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link"&gt;four in children&lt;/a&gt;. Last year at this time, there were 33 deaths. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We haven’t seen many pediatric deaths in Massachusetts, thank goodness, for a while, but we are seeing them this year,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “Overall, it’s shaping up to be a particularly bad flu season.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff said  the early spike might be partly driven by the dominant strain circulating this season: influenza A H3N2, specifically a newer subclade known as &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barouch said  subclade K contains &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-subclade-k-flu-and-vaccine-protection-against-it" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-subclade-k-flu-and-vaccine-protection-against-it"&gt;eight amino acid mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the part of the virus that the immune system recognizes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It is believed that it will partially evade antibodies, either induced by the vaccine or induced by prior infection,” Barouch said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Although the country is well into flu season, health experts continue to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/23/metro/boston-flu-cases-spike/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/23/metro/boston-flu-cases-spike/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link"&gt;strongly recommend vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;. Barouch cited data from the United Kingdom suggesting the current flu vaccine is 70 to 80 percent effective at preventing pediatric hospitalizations and 30 to 40 percent  effective at preventing adult hospitalizations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This year, flu vaccination rates are lower than in previous years. As of now, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases"&gt;almost 35 percent&lt;/a&gt; of eligible Massachusetts residents have received a flu shot, according to DPH, compared to 37 percent at this time last year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The impact of the early surge has been felt acutely in hospitals. At UMass Memorial Medical Center, flu-related visits have made up a  significant portion of the emergency department traffic. The hospital has seen 2,615 positive cases this season, from the beginning of October until now, almost double the number they saw last season.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re probably seeing close to 20 percent of emergency department cases related to influenza right now,” said Dr. Timothy Boardman, an emergency medicine physician at the hospital. “That’s a very high number when you consider all the other emergencies we see in a day.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boardman said the hospital saw a major spike in flu cases around the holiday period, with levels remaining consistently high early into January. While last year’s flu season peaked later, the overall intensity appears similar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boardman and Madoff noted that while influenza A cases may begin to decline soon, another wave could follow. Boardman said flu seasons often have two phases, with influenza B typically emerging later in February and March. Madoff added there could be a possible rise of COVID-19 or RSV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In emergency departments, Boardman said the most common patients are children under 5 and adults 65 and older — groups that are especially susceptible to severe complications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Children have smaller airways and can develop breathing difficulties more quickly,” he said. “Older adults often have underlying conditions that make influenza more dangerous.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Health officials emphasized &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-rates-influenza-flu-2026/?p1=StaffPage" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-rates-influenza-flu-2026/?p1=StaffPage"&gt;prevention and appropriate care&lt;/a&gt; as key strategies. Basic measures such as handwashing, masking in crowded areas, and staying home when sick can reduce transmission. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boardman said most flu cases can be treated at home or at urgent care facilities. However, individuals experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, or bluish discoloration of lips and fingers should seek emergency care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff also highlighted the importance of early treatment for high-risk individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are antiviral treatments for flu that can reduce severe complications and be life-saving,” Madoff said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

			&lt;p&gt;The secret to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-hair-could-make-the-ultimate-toothpaste"&gt;preventing tooth decay&lt;/a&gt; may have been hiding in your mouth all along. Increasing levels of an amino acid in saliva can turn bacterial biofilms from damaging to protective, a clinical study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar doesn't directly harm your teeth – but it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbiologists-explain-what-happens-in-your-mouth-when-you-eat-sugar"&gt;attracts and feeds bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that do. These bugs excrete acidic substances that then get to work dissolving tooth enamel. The issue is worsened by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbes-can-form-superorganisms-that-crawl-across-our-teeth"&gt;bacterial biofilms&lt;/a&gt; that form on tooth surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the recent study from researchers at Aarhus University in Denmark has found a way to switch the balance of power among mouth microbes back in our favor. The key is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid that's naturally found in saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/silencing-bacterial-chatter-in-your-mouth-may-help-prevent-tooth-decay"&gt;Silencing Bacterial 'Chatter' in Your Mouth May Help Prevent Tooth Decay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with active tooth decay, regular arginine treatment significantly reduced the acidity of bacterial biofilms, by changing the ratios of sugars and bacteria populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results revealed differences in acidity of the biofilms, with the ones treated with arginine being significantly more protected against acidification caused by sugar metabolism," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yumi Del Rey, microbiologist at Aarhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10005-2693"&gt;Plenty of previous research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested arginine plays a role in keeping tooth decay at bay, but most studies have been conducted in lab experiments. The Aarhus University study was designed to test whether the same effects occur in real-world environments of human mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188581" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-642x192.jpeg" alt="A Secret Ingredient For Preventing Tooth Decay Might Be in Your Mouth Already" class="wp-image-188581 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-642x192.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-1200x360.jpeg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-768x230.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-1536x460.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-600x180.jpeg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay.jpeg 1898w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A diagram illustrating the dentures designed to grow biofilms and how they were treated. (Del Rey et al., &lt;em&gt;Int. J. Oral Sci.&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten participants wore dentures over their lower teeth for four days, which had tiny panels on either side that allowed biofilms to form. Three times a day, the dentures were removed for treatment in a dipping device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the biofilm panels were bathed in a solution containing 10 percent sucrose. Then, one side was treated with an arginine solution while the other was dunked in plain old distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four days, the dentures were removed and the biofilms examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The aim was to investigate the impact of arginine treatment on the acidity, type of bacteria, and the carbohydrate matrix of biofilms from patients with active caries," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sebastian Schlafer, microbiologist at Aarhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the biofilms were exposed to sugar again, those treated with arginine consistently showed higher pH levels. If you remember your high school chemistry days, a higher pH means lower acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team investigated how arginine might be reducing acidity, by taking stock of which bacteria and sugars were present in each sample. Biofilms treated with arginine showed lower levels of a sugar called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucose"&gt;fucose&lt;/a&gt;, while another sugar, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"&gt;galactose&lt;/a&gt;, was concentrated towards the outer surface of the biofilm – in other words, away from the tooth surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the DNA of bacteria present, the researchers found that arginine treatment significantly reduced a specific population of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bacteria that produce acid, while slightly increasing other bacterial strains that can metabolize arginine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, results seemed to vary from person to person. Some participants didn't respond to treatment, and the researchers were unable to link this variability to clear differences in populations of microbes or sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work will need to be done to investigate how arginine affects biofilms, but the amino acid could be a promising new addition to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-newly-discovered-bacteria-can-help-prevent-cavities-and-scientists-want-to-put-them-in-a-pill"&gt;oral hygiene products&lt;/a&gt; like toothpaste or mouthwash. And it's already considered safe – not only is arginine naturally present, but it's also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;used to treat conditions&lt;/a&gt; like high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-025-00404-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Journal of Oral Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Masks are required for patients and visitors in what the health system defines as high-risk areas, which include places like cancer centers and emergency department waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG Health and its parent organization, University of Pennsylvania Health System, took the measure in response to escalating cases of influenza, which is a national trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No specific types of masks are required, and the policy will be revisited on a weekly basis going forward. LG Health hospitals will have masks available on site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The health system made the decision by looking at “percent positivity of testing” for the flu, LG Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Justin Roberts explained. More than 30% of people who have come in for a flu test have tested positive in the past week or two, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“How sick people are getting, we’re still probably a week or two away from the peak. That’s why putting on the masks made sense for the team,” Roberts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There is no official timeline for when the mask policy will end, but Roberts said the health system will review the policy on a weekly basis until cases ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the other health systems here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;None of the other three major health systems active in Lancaster County reported having mask mandates as of today. They offered the following statements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPMC:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;“UPMC maintains masking guidelines for specific patient care scenarios as part of our ongoing commitment to safety. Masking is a proven way to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses in health care settings. Masks are available throughout our facilities, and we encourage everyone, including staff, patients, visitors, support persons, vendors, students, residents and volunteers to wear masks in patient-accessible areas when transmission rates of serious respiratory viruses are elevated.” - Dr. Graham Snyder, medical director, UPMC Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology; and associate professor, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WellSpan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;“At this time we do not have any masking requirements in place in our WellSpan facilities. We do ask individuals to consider optional masking in busy settings or when visiting with immunocompromised patients, especially during cold and flu season, or if you are feeling sick – all important recommendations that help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.” - Ryan Coyle, senior manager, media relations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Penn State Health:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Penn State Health maintains a systemwide Viral Respiratory Illness policy that defines when masking is required or recommended.

In the mid-1990s, the rate was 63%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92f642" class="body-graf"&gt;The 70% figure is based on diagnoses from 2015 to 2021. The findings were published Tuesday in the American Cancer Society’s medical journal, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b3fae" class="body-graf"&gt;Five years is the most common benchmark for measuring cancer survival, since the risk of certain cancers’ recurring declines significantly if the cancers haven’t come back within that time.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a09bc" class="body-graf"&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038" target="_blank"&gt;improved treatment options&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade, many cancers have gone from death sentences to chronic diseases, according to the report’s lead author, Rebecca Siegel, the American Cancer Society’s senior scientific director of surveillance research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a649fa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It takes decades for research to understand and develop these more effective treatments, and now we’re seeing the fruits of those investments,” Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cd0ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The report estimates that 4.8 million cancer deaths were prevented from 1991 to 2023, largely because of better treatments, earlier detection methods and reductions in smoking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86dfd3" class="body-graf"&gt;Siegel said scientists have a greater understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/fat-cells-breast-cancer-tumors-triple-negative-risk-overweight-rcna225598" target="_blank"&gt;how cancer develops and spreads&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to engineer the immune system to stop or slow cancer growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d185f9" class="body-graf"&gt;She highlighted immunotherapies as one of the biggest advances — the treatments help the immune system find and attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy has been “game changing” for myeloma, Siegel said. The five-year survival rate for the blood cancer, which is twice as common among Black people as in white people in the U.S., rose to 62% from 32% in the mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-475727" class="body-graf"&gt;Targeted therapy, which targets specific genes or proteins that help cancer cells grow, has been &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-fighting-antibodies-inject-chemo-directly-tumor-cells-upping-ef-rcna153773" target="_blank"&gt;another major advancement&lt;/a&gt;, as such treatments cause less damage to healthy cells and come with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f51dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Staying on treatment longer allows patients to live longer, and these less toxic treatments allow more sequences of therapy,” said Dr. Christopher Flowers, head of cancer medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn’t involved in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c3e2c" class="body-graf"&gt;Flowers said targeted therapies and immunotherapies have improved survival outcomes for lung cancer, which kills more people than any other cancer in the U.S. The five-year survival rate for regional lung cancer — which is found in the lung and nearby structures or lymph nodes — is now 37%, up from 20% in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73f5d7" class="body-graf"&gt;However, further progress could be made by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/ultra-processed-foods-linked-increased-risk-precancerous-polyps-study-rcna243574" target="_blank"&gt;addressing major risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, said Dr. Clark Gamblin, a gastrointestinal surgeon at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and chief of surgical oncology at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-043a73" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our country has an epidemic of obesity, and cancers follow that,” said Gamblin, who wasn’t involved in the report. “So we’re not winning on every front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0edb7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Colorectal cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-rates-rising-young-people-deaths-diagnosis-rcna233805" target="_blank"&gt;rising in people under age 50&lt;/a&gt;, and overall breast cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-cases-increasing-women-declining-men-report-rcna187586" target="_blank"&gt;rising among women&lt;/a&gt;. Obesity can be a risk factor for both cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-081f56" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be more than 626,000 cancer deaths and more than 2.1 million newly diagnosed cases in the U.S. this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91112f" class="body-graf"&gt;Siegel said she is concerned about scientists’ ability to study new methods of prevention, detection and treatment, given recent cuts to cancer research by the Trump administration. An &lt;a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/HELP-Committee-Minority-Report-Trumps-War-on-Science.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analysis from Democrats&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee found a 31% decline in cancer research grant funding in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a6713" class="body-graf"&gt;“Other threats to progress are the enormous gap that we see in the cancer burden in people of color, specifically Native American people and Black people,” Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f3fb2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The same populations are among the most affected by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-leaves-town-2026-no-health-care-deal-forcing-premium-hikes-rcna249817" target="_blank"&gt;the expiration of Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies&lt;/a&gt;, which could reduce access to cancer drugs, Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e8eb17" class="body-graf"&gt;Disruptions to cancer screening during the Covid pandemic could also have further effects, including late-stage diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-223f85" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The screening for [asymptomatic] cancer largely stopped during that time period, and I don’t know that we’ve seen the tail of that yet,” Gamblin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPaGtvQlhiUTF1SEF2TUZwdGQ2TkhnRFBwU3B1dTladFJrdzNwVFpmdldhWGNReGNFRDlZeHdwVWp0MFN5RVk1UkZqZ3hIb2VjN3RmNldwOW1yY0thZ1dRRXRKVElhbEotMWpjVXBkc0Z6VTQ5ZGlrOEpJNEtveTNudWVDNkRLa2xZQnBmd2tzbzhDQVl0cXNheTNDalNydw</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州是全国流感发病率最高的州之一–一名急诊室医生描述了为什么2025-26年流感季节受到重创- The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/colorado-ranks-among-the-highest-states-in-the-country-for-flu-an-emergency-room-physician-describes-why-the-2025-26-flu-season-is-hitting-hard-273069</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colorado is in the midst of a record-breaking flu season. In the week ending Dec. 27, 2025, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report"&gt;831 people were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with influenza – the most since the state started &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1506.081645"&gt;tracking flu cases two decades ago&lt;/a&gt;. Hospitalizations eased the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report"&gt;following week to 737&lt;/a&gt; but still remain higher than prior years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colorado is among the top five states with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html"&gt;the most flu activity in the country&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/doctor-visits-for-flu-hit-highest-level-in-almost-30-years/"&gt;doctor’s visits for flu-like illness at a 30-year record high&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html"&gt;weekly influenza surveillance report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24314"&gt;emergency medicine and critical care physician&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Colorado. In my 18 years of practicing clinical medicine, this year is one of the worst I have seen. Our emergency department hit a record number of single-day total visits over the holidays, and visit volumes have stayed high. Flu is likely contributing to this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is always a season where respiratory viruses hit hard, this year influenza is making patients miserable and wreaking havoc on both the state and national health care system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does this year’s ‘super flu’ differ from other flu seasons?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/31/colorado-rough-flu-season-explained/"&gt;season is especially rough&lt;/a&gt; because of the volume of people seeking emergency care. This flu came on fast and seems to be very contagious, and its symptoms are more severe than other recent years’ flu strains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu tends to cause fever, body aches and maybe a cough. But this so-called super flu has also caused vomiting and diarrhea, which has made people feel much worse than isolated respiratory symptoms alone. When people are feeling worse, they seek emergency care, which is part of why our emergency department is seeing so many people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past flu seasons, which typically run from October through February, emergency rooms were full because they were facing multiple outbreaks, such as the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/flu-rsv-and-covid-19-advice-from-family-doctors-on-how-to-get-through-this-winters-tripledemic-195088"&gt;2022 “tripledemic” of COVID-19, flu and RSV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this 2025-26 flu season, we’re seeing high emergency department visits specifically from the flu. The first group of patients we’re seeing are healthy people who are feeling worse with this flu, which comes with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and come to the emergency department looking for symptomatic relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group are those with severe manifestations of the flu or who have underlying comorbidities such as asthma or heart disease that can be exacerbated by influenza. This is a population that may require oxygen, or they’re a transplant patient and they’re requiring hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This double whammy of people feeling really miserable from their symptoms plus people with comorbidities experiencing complications is when you really see a strain on the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRpqvuOm1NM?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The CDC ranks Colorado’s flu activity among the highest in the U.S., along with Louisiana, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are any age groups being hit harder than others?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is seeing the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;highest number of visits to emergency departments&lt;/a&gt; in children ages 5 to 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids generally seem to be having milder flu cases than adults, which is typical for some of these viruses. But there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;17 pediatric deaths associated with influenza&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S., with eight in the week ending January 3. That number of deaths in children is not typical at this point in the season.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young people in their 20s are feeling pretty bad from this year’s flu, but we’re not seeing a lot of complications or hospitalizations in this group across the U.S. and in emergency departments in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing a lot of people who have underlying conditions, such as asthma, as well as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and those who are immune-compromised. They get the flu, and then it leads to kind of a cascade, or a worsening of their underlying medical problems. This is different from what we saw with COVID-19, where &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53590"&gt;healthy people got very, very sick from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm"&gt;older you get, the more likely&lt;/a&gt; you are to experience complications, such as needing oxygen, which typically requires hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are you still encouraging people to get the flu shot if they haven’t yet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should still consider getting your flu shot, especially if you have medical problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting an &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/influenza"&gt;annual, updated flu shot&lt;/a&gt; helps with severity of diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/how-does-the-flu-vaccine-work"&gt;even if it doesn’t provide total protection&lt;/a&gt;. Especially if you have underlying conditions, it’s important to do everything you can to decrease symptom severity, duration and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/flu-shot-more-than-good-enough-says-expert/"&gt;risk of hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Getting the flu shot reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization, especially for people who are older or have other medical conditions.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/dr-gaurav-shinde-gives-giti-noroozi-her-vaccinations-for-news-photo/2169740399?adppopup=true"&gt;Genaro Molina/Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When should you consider going to an emergency room?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime breathing becomes difficult, or you experience severe chest pain or headaches that are abnormal, that’s something that we want you to seek medical care for right away. And of course, if somebody’s worried about a symptom, we’re here 365 days a year, and we’re happy to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling bad – such as a mild headache, body aches, fever, sometimes some cough and congestion, and as I mentioned with this flu, potentially vomiting and diarrhea – that is very normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s flu, COVID-19 or RSV in a healthy, mildly symptomatic patient, it doesn’t really matter what they have, because there’s not a specific treatment. There’s not anything that we can do that’s going to make them better, other than “tincture of time,” meaning lots of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, lung problems or are immune-compromised, and you are experiencing severe symptoms, you should at the very least see your primary care doctor if not the emergency department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it important to get tested for the sake of knowing what you have?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of patients want to know what virus they have, but if you’re young and healthy, there’s not really a need for testing other than surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colorado’s infectious disease trackers say wastewater surveillance is the No. 1 way to figure out what infectious diseases are in the community. We can’t get a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/testing-methods/consider-influenza-testing.html"&gt;comprehensive sample through hospitals and clinics&lt;/a&gt;, because there are so many people who are home, don’t get tested and do not seek health care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;In Colorado and other states, wastewater is tested for infectious pathogens, including influenza, COVID-19 and RSV. This testing indicates the prevalence of a virus in a given community.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/brian-leighton-chief-operator-at-yarmouth-wastewater-news-photo/1237975362?adppopup=true"&gt;Portland Press Herald/Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/dcphr/wastewater#dboard1"&gt;wastewater samples in Colorado are testing extraordinarily high&lt;/a&gt; for the flu and pretty low for RSV and COVID-19. Wastewater is a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/wastewater-monitoring-took-off-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-heres-how-it-could-help-head-off-future-outbreaks-180775"&gt;very reliable test&lt;/a&gt; because everybody produces wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it’s important for the overall health care system that laboratory testing be used judiciously. Testing does help us understand what’s in the community. But from a hospital and emergency department lens, the more tests we send to the lab that have to be run, the more testing services for other illnesses get backed up. It also adds a burden to nursing and other clinical staff, as well as costs for the patient and hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if a patient is sick with manageable symptoms from a virus, it’s the same standard advice: Stay at home, wash your hands and consider a mask if you have to go out in public.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

The research shows that while men strongly prefer one gender over the other, women tend to display a wider range of potential attractions. These results appear in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2545965" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Sex Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, researchers have attempted to map the differences in how men and women experience sexual desire. Older investigations often relied on measuring physical signs of arousal in a laboratory setting. Those experiments frequently suggested that men are “gender-specific.” This means men typically show physical arousal only when viewing the gender they prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those same historical studies often found that straight women displayed physical arousal when viewing images of both men and women. This led to a prevailing theory that female sexuality is inherently less specific than male sexuality. However, it remained unclear if this pattern applied to psychological feelings of attraction or fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapir Keinan-Bar, Yoav Bar-Anan, and Daphna Joel conducted the current investigation to answer this question. They are researchers affiliated with the School of Psychological Sciences and the Sagol School of Neuroscience at Tel-Aviv University. They sought to determine if the gender gap in specificity exists when measuring self-reported feelings and subconscious associations. They also aimed to see how these patterns manifest across different sexual orientations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team aggregated data from three separate large-scale online datasets. The total pool of participants included 56,892 individuals. The datasets contained information from volunteers who had visited research websites or utilized paid survey platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed responses to direct questions regarding sexual identity. Participants rated their level of attraction to men and women on numerical scales. They also reported the frequency of their erotic fantasies involving men or women. This allowed the authors to compare conscious reports of desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct questions, the study utilized indirect measures of attraction. One primary tool used was the Implicit Association Test (IAT). This computerized task measures the strength of mental links between concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During an IAT, a participant might sort words or images into categories like “Men” or “Women” and “I am sexually attracted” or “I am not sexually attracted.” The speed at which a participant sorts these items reveals their automatic associations. A faster response time suggests a stronger underlying mental connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used a variation called the Questionnaire-Based Implicit Association Test (qIAT). This version uses statements rather than single words or images. It assesses attraction to men and women separately rather than comparing them directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of this massive dataset revealed a consistent pattern. Men generally exhibited greater gender-specificity than women. This trend appeared across self-reported attraction, fantasy frequency, and the indirect association measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data provided a detailed look at why this gap exists. Men reported very high levels of attraction toward their preferred gender. At the same time, they reported very low levels of attraction toward their non-preferred gender. This created a large statistical gap between their likes and dislikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women showed a different profile. They reported slightly lower levels of attraction to their preferred gender compared to men. More importantly, they reported higher levels of attraction to their non-preferred gender than men did. This finding suggests that women are psychologically more open to their non-preferred gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study clarified the nature of attraction among heterosexual women. Contrary to some interpretations of older physiological studies, straight women were not completely non-specific. They clearly preferred men over women in both self-reports and indirect measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the intensity of this preference was not as exclusive as the preference straight men held for women. Straight women demonstrated a distinct preference, but the separation was less extreme. The researchers noted that this pattern was robust across the different samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also examined individuals who identified as gay or lesbian. The researchers found that the gender gap in specificity was different in these groups. The large difference seen between straight men and women was often smaller, absent, or reversed among gay and lesbian participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, lesbian women showed levels of specificity that were sometimes similar to, or even higher than, gay men. This suggests that the high degree of exclusivity observed in straight men might be a unique characteristic of that specific group. It may not be a universal trait of male sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of sexual fantasies reinforced the findings regarding attraction. Men reported fantasies almost exclusively about their preferred gender. Women reported fantasies primarily about their preferred gender, but with more frequent exceptions than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors evaluated several theoretical explanations for these results. One common theory posits that men simply have a higher sex drive than women. The data presented a challenge to this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If men simply had a higher sex drive, they should report higher attraction to everyone. Instead, women reported higher attraction to their non-preferred gender than men did. This indicates that the difference is not just about the total amount of sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory considers the impact of social norms. Society often imposes strict expectations on heterosexual masculinity. Men face social penalties for showing interest in other men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This social pressure might encourage men to report extreme attraction to women and deny any attraction to men. This would create the highly specific pattern observed in the data. Women generally face less social stigma for expressing flexibility in their attractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also discussed the theory of sexual objectification. Western culture frequently portrays women as sexual objects. This cultural conditioning might cause individuals of all genders to develop some degree of attraction toward women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offered some support for this objectification hypothesis. Across the board, attraction to the non-preferred gender was higher when that gender was female. For instance, straight women reported more attraction to women than straight men reported to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers pointed out the benefits of using detailed categories for sexual orientation. The study allowed participants to identify as “mostly straight” or “mostly gay” rather than just using three rigid categories. This nuance revealed that people in the “mostly” categories drove much of the flexibility seen in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women were more likely than men to identify with these “mostly” categories. Men were more likely to identify as “exclusively” straight or gay. This difference in self-identification aligns with the finding that men are more gender-specific in their attractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this research. The data came from online samples, which may not perfectly represent the general population. The participants were primarily English speakers and likely skewed younger and more liberal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures relied on honesty in self-reporting and the assumption that reaction times reflect attraction. These are proxies for real-world experience. The study did not measure physiological arousal, so it cannot be directly compared to the older laboratory studies on that metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these patterns in different cultures. Examining societies with different gender norms could help separate biological tendencies from social conditioning. It would be useful to see if the high specificity of straight men persists in cultures with different concepts of masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2025.2545965" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gender-Specificity in Sexual Attraction and Fantasies: Evidence from Self-Report and Indirect Measures&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sapir Keinan-Bar, Yoav Bar-Anan, and Daphna Joel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:10:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQcEhubExKOGxMZ2xmRl9hbElXMF9jVGQyZnF0cVJ3R1VrbWZ6TFMxd0k1bE1lV25iZDhqeGE0TzdMMkYzaS1xVTdxeDhJcHN5Z1g4enJPQXp0S3hXdW9JenRTa1cyV0lhcWtVcU9wWS1oZEtHMUpQbWxQUGEtQW93OGRBaDdIOEdzLWFISGR3cjlJczlWVVBycUpPTlZPUQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现从人类神经元中清除有毒Tau的方法- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-method-to-erase-toxic-tau-from-human-neurons/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:56:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPTk1DX0V5NlZxb09sZ0xHalBnaW5PbmwxaFdjcFFLWHRHNWRXVWczbnJaQUx5Q2xPdHlyYy1OWVUxVlRYTTA2VmpuLVY3S2YxSmtXUkMzLVczbmwwZjhWSGFfeXJHb2VMWGJYWThLV0VWYVoxM3RCcVBQb3ZubDRXUGxCMnhHR2VpbTNyMmZqeFFzUkRa</guid></item><item><title>这种高度传染性的冬季病毒病例比前几个季节更糟糕。“以下是您需要了解的信息。- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/high-flu-rates-united-states_l_696118bde4b0120ab25d1957</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re in the middle of a severe and record-breaking &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/winter-health" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="flu" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696118bde4b0120ab25d1957" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/winter-health" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; season throughout the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu-related doctor’s visits are at an all-time high as millions of people come down with the virus.

While this marks a large decrease, it does not mean the flu has peaked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What the CDC is saying is that people weren’t seeking care during the holidays,” Teichman explained. This is likely the reason behind the drop in cases, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people were sick with the flu but not getting tested, flu rates would appear lower — even if they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sood added that folks who already had time off from work for the holidays may have decided to get better at home and not seek testing or treatment. So, if folks were off the week between Christmas and New Year’s, flu rates through early January may appear lower than they actually are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not really clear if the cases are going down because the actual incidence of infection is going down, which I hope is the case, or if it’s just backlog or less people seeking care and testing during the holidays and right after the holidays,” Sood added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see that cases may be starting to tail off, but I would caution people that it’s still early days ... we would want to see a continuing trend, a downward trend, before we let down our guard,” said &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1636/daniel-kuritzkes-infectious_disease-boston" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Daniel R.

We are not at peak yet ... most commonly we peak in February, but we’ll see,” Teichman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rough flu season is likely being caused by “a slight mismatch” between the prevalent circulating flu strain and the flu shot, according to Kuritzkes. This is because a new flu strain emerged after the flu shot formulation was decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu hospitalizations and deaths are up throughout the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths from the flu are up from the prior week, according to the most recent CDC data. Experts say this makes sense after the particularly high surge in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always say that hospitalization and mortality are lagging indicators because people have to have caught the flu and then progressed to the point where they’re sick enough to be hospitalized,” Kuritzkes noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt; If you are not feeling well, stay home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to avoid getting the flu? Here’s what you can do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should still be continuing to take all the precautions that they ordinarily would, in terms of careful attention to washing your hands when you come in from being out and about, wearing a mask if you’re in crowded indoor circumstances, staying away from people who are coughing and sneezing,” Kuritzkes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try also to avoid contact with high-touch surfaces, Teichman suggested.

&lt;p id="294adb53-b72c-4cc4-bed4-0c6e10209ca1"&gt;The U.S. federal government &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/new-us-food-pyramid-recommends-very-high-protein-diet-beef-tallow-as-healthy-fat-option-and-full-fat-dairy" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/new-us-food-pyramid-recommends-very-high-protein-diet-beef-tallow-as-healthy-fat-option-and-full-fat-dairy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;just released a new version of the food pyramid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with a recommendation that Americans eat more protein than previously advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previously recommended daily intake of protein was around 0.8 grams for each kilogram of body weight. That recommendation aimed at meeting the nutritional needs of an average, sedentary adult. Now, the new dietary guidelines suggest people should consume between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kg of body weight per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="294adb53-b72c-4cc4-bed4-0c6e10209ca1-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;So, to meet the new recommendations, a person weighing 154 pounds (70 kg) would need to consume around 84 to 112 grams (3 to 4 ounces) of protein per day, as opposed to 56 grams (2 ounces) under the old recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9910b224-835c-4c64-85fc-0e45a36f1f6d"&gt;"It is unclear why the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans] increased the recommendation by 50% to 100%," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/alice-lichtenstein" target="_blank" data-url="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/alice-lichtenstein" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alice Lichtenstein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an American Heart Association fellow and nutrition science professor at Tufts University, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, scientists previously estimated that the average U.S. adult's protein consumption generally exceeded the old guideline. A 2013 study estimated it at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55785-2/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55785-2/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.2 to 1.4 grams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; per kg of body weight per day, while &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589212/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589212/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a 2021 dietary data brief&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted men and women were consuming 97 grams and 69 grams on a given day, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the shift in guidance raises some questions: Are there benefits to upping your protein intake? And is there an upper limit you shouldn't cross?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts told Live Science that there's no single, agreed-upon maximum amount of protein you can eat in a day. That said, if you're not particularly active, pushing your protein intake beyond what the old recommendation suggested is unlikely to be very beneficial, they said. Additionally, it would be harmful to boost your protein intake at the expense of eating other macronutrients, like fat and carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UG2BUSR6ibVd8GeKSuyAe4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UG2BUSR6ibVd8GeKSuyAe4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-0aac02b5-8859-49ac-9e7c-6057c35c35b8" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-protein-important-3"&gt;Why is protein important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="47524dba-9b60-4de7-a8cf-b3fcfbb9a8fa"&gt;Proteins are the body's building blocks, forming everything from muscles and hormones to digestive enzymes and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-high-protein-foods" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-high-protein-foods"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Protein-rich foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include meat, fish and eggs, as well as tofu, beans and nuts. The proteins in these foods get broken down by our bodies into their component parts — amino acids — which cells can use to produce the proteins we need. While the body can produce some amino acids on its own, there are nine, called essential amino acids, that we can get only through our diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A given person's protein requirements vary depending on a number of factors, with one of the more crucial ones being how much they exercise. So generally, increases in protein intake should be accompanied by increases in activity levels, Lichtenstein told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the studies that I am aware of have not demonstrated that increasing protein intake above current recommendations increases lean muscle mass," she said. "If it does, it needs to be coupled with certain types of physical activity, not a strong point for most people." Those types of activity might &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-weight-training" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-weight-training"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include strength&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/boost-your-running-speed-with-training-but-dont-fall-for-these-myths-scientists-say" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/boost-your-running-speed-with-training-but-dont-fall-for-these-myths-scientists-say"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endurance training&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;it's been recommended that&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people who regularly exercise get about 1.1 to 1.5 grams per kg per day, while people training for athletic events might eat up to 1.7 grams per kg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, active people still need to take in adequate energy from carbs and fats. If they don't, the body may resort to using amino acids as fuel, effectively &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iris.who.int/items/78c03092-bcc2-40f5-90d1-60641ecdf6ea" target="_blank" data-url="https://iris.who.int/items/78c03092-bcc2-40f5-90d1-60641ecdf6ea" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increasing the amount of protein they need&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make up for the loss of protein building blocks in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor that influences our protein requirements is age.

Additionally, protein sources that are high in purine — such as red meat, organs like kidney, and certain types of seafood — can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17808-hyperuricemia-high-uric-acid-level" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17808-hyperuricemia-high-uric-acid-level" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead to gout and kidney stones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important to note that there is no single, official upper limit," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nutritionnews.abbott/media-center/our-experts/bridget-cassady/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nutritionnews.abbott/media-center/our-experts/bridget-cassady/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bridget Cassady&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) at Abbott, told Live Science in an email. "An amount that is considered 'excessive' will be different based on your needs varying with age, body weight, activity level, health status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="81109280-9dc7-4f36-88a3-1daf9cf296c9"&gt;Broadly speaking, though, Cassady said that healthy individuals can safely consume "moderately high" amounts of protein — around 2 grams per kg per day — as long as it's part of a balanced diet. Protein consumption should not come at the expense of other nutrients; if it starts crowding out fiber-rich plants, healthy fats, or whole-food carbohydrates, that's when protein intake could start becoming a concern, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the extreme, a super high-protein diet could put strain on the kidneys, which can filter only so much urea — a protein waste product — from the blood at a given time.

    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, cream cheese also contains vitamin K2, an often under-recognised nutrient. It plays a key role in ensuring that any calcium ingested through diet ends up in the right places, for example the bones and teeth, rather than aggregating in the arteries and brain, where it can impair heart and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jaacks points out that you don’t necessarily need to be eating cream cheese in particular, to get these nutrients. “This is just dairy in general,” she says. “So you could also get it from having milk in your coffee, or just drinking a glass of milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Con: It’s low in calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all other dairy products, cream cheese does contain calcium, but in significantly lower amounts than other cheeses. For example, two teaspoons (30 grams) of cream cheese contains 30 milligrams of calcium, but the equivalent amount of cheddar contains 200 milligrams of calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average adult needs at least 700mg of calcium per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Pro: It’s a fermented food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pointed out by Tim Spector, an epidemiology professor at King’s College London and founder of nutrition company Zoe, cream cheeses such as Philadelphia actually count as fermented foods. This group of foods has been increasingly linked to better gut and immune health in research studies over the last 10 years, because they stimulate immune cells in your intestines with live microbes. This then makes them more effective at regulating the gut microbiome, which has many benefits for our wider health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Philadelphia does have live microbes in it,” says Prof Spector. “We can be a bit snobby and say it’s mass produced, but it does count as a fermented food. I tend to buy one from my local Italian delicatessen that I think tastes better. But if I’m stuck, I’m not too proud and I will have Philadelphia cream cheese.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Con: It might encourage you to consume more UPFs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jaacks is still somewhat sceptical of cream cheese, as compared with more traditional cheeses such as cheddar, goat’s cheese or mozzarella, it is still an industrially manufactured ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, most cream cheese bought from your local deli should be made using traditional processes – heating milk and cream, adding lactic acid to coagulate the resulting mixture into curds, draining the whey, then blending the curds until smooth. This means they need to be consumed soon after purchase. Meanwhile, mass market brands like Philadelphia contain additives such as stabilisers and emulsifiers. These additives are required for extra mixing of ingredients to ensure the kind of consistent taste and mouthfeel that is characteristic of most highly-processed foods, as well as allowing the cheese to remain on supermarket shelves for longer periods without spoiling.&lt;/p&gt;

Congratulations: you have the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Every winter in the US has its share of flu cases, but this season is shaping up to be particularly bad. Early this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-says-2025-26-flu-season-moderately-severe-cases-hit-11-million-2026-01-05/"&gt;put the flu season&lt;/a&gt; in the “moderately severe” category, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;with an estimated&lt;/a&gt; 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths so far. Here in New York, where I live, the city kicked off 2026 by &lt;a href="https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2026/2026-01-02_flu_hospitalizations.htm"&gt;setting records&lt;/a&gt; for flu-related hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While what we’re experiencing is not a “&lt;a href="https://news.nova.edu/in-the-news/nsu-professor-shares-insight-on-super-flu-and-its-nationwide-impact/"&gt;super flu,&lt;/a&gt;” it is a particularly bad one, thanks in part to the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/superflu-or-same-old-flu-how-subclade-k-influenza-playing-out-worldwide"&gt;emergence of a subgroup&lt;/a&gt; of the well-established H3N2 flu virus called &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/should-you-still-get-the-flu-shot-despite-the-new-strain-heres-why-doctors-recommend-it"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;. It carries a bunch of mutations that seem to have rendered the current flu vaccine somewhat less effective. (Though far from completely ineffective — more on that below.) Nor does it help that only around 44 percent of US adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html#:~:text=As%20of%20December%2027%2C%202025%2C%2043.5%25%20(95%25,definitely%20will%20get%20a%20vaccine."&gt;have taken the flu shot&lt;/a&gt; so far, well below vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/vaccination-2019-2020.html"&gt;before the Covid pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The decline has been particularly sharp for children, who are more vulnerable to the flu, which has resulted in &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34114/CDC-9-children-have-died-of-flu-this-season?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;higher than normal pediatric hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As bad as this season is shaping up to be, chances are most of us will suffer through it and then forget until the next year comes around. After all, it’s just the flu, right? But even normal influenza is far more than just a seasonal nuisance. The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-%28seasonal%29?"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that there are around &lt;em&gt;1 billion &lt;/em&gt;flu infections in a given year, which can lead to as many as 5 million severe cases and up to 650,000 flu-related respiratory deaths per year, mostly among the very young and the very old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The burden of flu goes beyond those numbers: CDC research &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-flu-heart-study.html"&gt;indicates&lt;/a&gt; that flu infections can raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Plus all those sick days &lt;a href="https://www.challengergray.com/blog/flu-workplace-about-7b-lost-productivity/#:~:text=Online%20resource%2C%20Flu.gov%2C,billion%20annually%20in%20lost%20productivity."&gt;add up&lt;/a&gt; to as much as 111 million lost work days in the US alone, while childhood infections &lt;a href="https://familiesfightingflu.org/the-hidden-burden-of-flu-on-families-health-time-economics/"&gt;lead to more school absences&lt;/a&gt; and a knock-on effect for parents forced to stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Oh, and chances are decent that the (inevitable) next global pandemic will come from a mutant flu virus, just like past pandemics in 2009, 1968, 1957, and the granddaddy of them all, 1918, which killed &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/spanish-flu-largest-influenza-pandemic-in-history#:~:text=The%20widely%20cited%20study%20by,6"&gt;at least 50 million people&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So that’s the bad news. The good news? There are ways to protect yourself right now — and even more promising, glimmers on the scientific frontier of a world without flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-works-and-what-doesnt-with-the-flu-shot" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What works — and what doesn’t — with the flu shot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The simplest way to keep safe is, of course, to get your flu shot. Like right now — even though the flu season is well underway, it’s worth getting your shot if you haven’t yet. Early data from the UK &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6924637090a8c154e902625a/_WITHDRAWN__Flu_interimVE_2526.pdf"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; protection rates against hospital admission of 70 to 75 percent for children and 30 to 35 percent in adults. That’s normal: The standard flu vaccine isn’t great at preventing cases, but it is very effective in reducing the severity of illness. Throw in the fact that you can now &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/at-home-covid-test-kits/"&gt;easily get an at-home flu test&lt;/a&gt; and secure the antiviral Tamiflu early in an illness, and you do have the power to ensure your case is milder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it is true flu shots are not our most effective class of vaccine. That largely has to do with the nature of the flu, and how the shots are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Influenza is what you might call a “promiscuous” virus. Strains are constantly evolving, and can easily swap genetic material through a process called reassortment to create new, potentially more dangerous viruses. Because of that, international health officials have to create a new vaccine strain every year, hoping that it will match the strain actually circulating months later when vaccines are available for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If the dominant strain changes during those months, the vaccine will be less effective. And any vaccine that has to be taken over and over again on an annual basis is going to be a harder sell to the public, even before taking into account &lt;a href="/the-logoff-newsletter-trump/474084/trump-kennedy-childhood-vaccine-schedule-denmark-change-explained"&gt;rising anti-vax sentiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s already progress being made to reduce the time between when a vaccine strain is selected and when it can be produced, chiefly by &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/moderna-announces-promising-efficacy-results-mrna-flu-vaccine-trial"&gt;using rapid mRNA platforms&lt;/a&gt; rather than growing vaccines in eggs, as has been done for decades. But even better: What if it were possible to create a flu vaccine that was effective against a wide variety of different flu strains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-dream-of-a-universal-flu-vaccine" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The dream of a universal flu vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-02-strategic-universal-influenza-vaccine.pdf"&gt;“universal” flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is one that would be at least 75 percent effective against influenza A viruses and provide durable protection for at least a year (though ideally longer). In other words, it would be a vaccine that would act more like the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/expert-answers/getting-measles-after-vaccination/faq-20125397"&gt;almost perfectly protective measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and less like, well, a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Such “universal” flu coverage would not be one single breakthrough, but a portfolio of strategies for outsmarting a virus that mutates faster than our annual vaccine calendar. The first bucket is &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/universal-influenza-vaccine-research"&gt;universal (or universal-ish) vaccines&lt;/a&gt;: instead of training antibodies mainly against flu’s fast-changing hemagglutinin (HA) “head,” researchers are trying to steer immunity toward viral targets that mutate less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One major approach &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade4790"&gt;focuses on the HA stem or stalk&lt;/a&gt;, a region of the virus that changes more slowly; early human trials of stem-focused designs suggest these vaccines can be safe and elicit broadly reactive immune responses. Another vaccine strategy uses &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/vrc-uni-flu-vax"&gt;mosaic/nanoparticle displays&lt;/a&gt; that present HA antigens from multiple strains at once, aiming to teach the immune system to recognize flu’s common features rather than this year’s exact variant; the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/experimental-influenza-vaccine-flumos-v2-study"&gt;FluMos program&lt;/a&gt; is an example now in early clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/evaluating-dose-safety-tolerability-and-immunogenicity-mosaic-hexavalent-influenza"&gt;third line&lt;/a&gt; leans on broader immune mechanisms: targeting neuraminidase (NA) (the N in HN flu viruses), or boosting T-cell responses to internal proteins that rarely change, which may not always prevent infection but could make illness far less severe when the virus drifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s also the “universal without a vaccine” lane: prevention and treatment that don’t depend on your immune system’s memory. Cidara, a San Diego-based biotech company, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01955-3.pdf"&gt;has developed&lt;/a&gt; a long-acting preventive designed to provide season-long protection by chemically linking multiple copies of a neuraminidase inhibitor to a long-lasting antibody. Preclinical work has shown broad resistance to influenza A and B, and the company’s approach is promising enough that it is now in the process of being &lt;a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-to-complete-acquisition-of-cidara-therapeutics/"&gt;acquired by pharma giant Merck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even more sci-fi: using gene editing to create all-purpose flu treatments. Scientists in Australia are working on using the gene editing tool Crispr &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-flu-antivirals/"&gt;to develop&lt;/a&gt; an antiviral nasal spray that could shut down a wide variety of flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="we-shouldnt-have-to-live-with-the-flu" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;We shouldn’t have to live with the flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Historically, the US &lt;a href="http://google.com/search?q=Bryan+walsh+bloomberg+flu+vaccine&amp;amp;oq=Bryan+walsh+bloomberg+flu+vaccine&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCDQ4MzhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;hasn’t allocated&lt;/a&gt; nearly enough money to universal flu prevention research, though in May the Trump administration surprised scientists with &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20administration%E2%80%99s%20unprecedented%20%24500,Human%20Services%20Secretary%20Robert%20F."&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; to spend $500 million on an approach that relies on older vaccine technology. Except in those rare years when a flu pandemic boils over, we tend to treat flu as something we just have to suffer through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But hundreds of thousands of people globally each year won’t survive their bouts with the flu, and millions more will suffer because of the viruses. We’ve managed to all but knock out past killers like smallpox, the measles, and the mumps (Well, provided we agree to take our vaccines.) There’s reason to believe that influenza can be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNTGhkTTJDeGtGUWJ1eW02MW1XTGdWV21NbDZteU9lOXdtVXoyZFZzVF9yNy1RNTdHMWRNVEt1MWFETlRXU3U5OFNVUGxYRk0xQlJkSHNZRHBHa1lCWnBia3UyWTRENEJnblRnY1d3VloyNFhfWkU1UE8yXzkzc2ZhY05rRUZWeTlqZXYxUl92ZlNxUQ</guid></item><item><title>常见农药暴露与2.7倍的帕金森病风险相关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/common-pesticide-exposure-linked-with-2-7x-risk-of-parkinsons-disease</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos, widely used on US farms, has been linked to a more than 2.5-fold increase in the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding comes from a large community-based case–control study led by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The team also used animal models to identify the specific &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/prion-like-brain-damage-can-occur-without-infectious-prions-study-finds"&gt;kinds of brain damage&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpyrifos"&gt;chlorpyrifos&lt;/a&gt; might cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-230357"&gt;existing concerns&lt;/a&gt; around pesticides and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="188495" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, although establishing long-term chemical exposure and separating it from other risk factors, such as genetics, can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-may-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already"&gt;Parkinson's Discovery Suggests We May Have an FDA-Approved Treatment Already&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study establishes chlorpyrifos as a specific environmental risk factor for Parkinson's disease, not just pesticides as a general class," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/widely-used-pesticide-linked-more-doubled-parkinsons-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Jeff Bronstein, from UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared 829 people diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; with 824 people without the condition. By combining participants' home and workplace addresses with California pesticide-use records dating back to 1974, the team estimated each person's exposure to chlorpyrifos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with the highest workplace exposure for the longest periods had 2.74 times higher odds of developing Parkinson's, compared with people who had minimal or no exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the risk rose significantly for exposure going back more than a decade, consistent with the development of Parkinson's, which often starts many years &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-voice-could-hide-the-tell-tale-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;before symptoms appear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188498" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainProteins.jpg" alt="Protein in mouse brains" class="wp-image-188498 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainProteins-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188498" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alpha-synuclein proteins (in green) were more abundant after exposure to chlorpyrifos (bottom row) in mouse brains. (Hasan et al., &lt;em&gt;Mol. Neurodegener.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether the association might be causal, the team conducted experiments in mice and zebrafish. Mice exposed to chlorpyrifos showed signs of impaired movement, and lost dopamine-producing neurons in their brain – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;a hallmark of Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clumps of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-synuclein"&gt;alpha-synuclein protein&lt;/a&gt; were also seen in the mouse brains – again matching pathological markers of Parkinson's. In zebrafish, chlorpyrifos interfered with autophagy, a key cellular waste-disposal process. When the researchers stimulated autophagy, neurons were better protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That link between chlorpyrifos and autophagy is significant: Several &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13101435"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown autophagy may be one of the pathways driving Parkinson's-related brain damage, and it might be the route chlorpyrifos chemicals take, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By showing the biological mechanism in animal models, we've demonstrated that this association is likely causal," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/widely-used-pesticide-linked-more-doubled-parkinsons-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bronstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chlorpyrifos has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-pesticide-linked-to-widespread-brain-abnormalities-in-children"&gt;already been linked&lt;/a&gt; to brain abnormalities in children and is banned in the UK and the European Union. In the US, its use has been somewhat restricted in recent decades, but the pesticide is still applied to food crops in many states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks increasingly likely that chlorpyrifos contributes to Parkinson's risk, but it's only one factor among many. While it's not clear how Parkinson's gets started, we do know that risk factors include the genes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-genetic-mutation-that-seems-to-protect-against-parkinsons"&gt;we're born with&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-6-sleep-traits-to-risk-of-172-diseases"&gt;poor quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and even how close &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/controversial-new-study-links-parkinsons-with-living-near-a-golf-course"&gt;we live to a golf course&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps due to pesticide use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers hope to look at other types of pesticides and their potential effects on the brain. They also want to explore whether treatments that prevent disruption of autophagy could protect against the damage caused by chlorpyrifos exposure and perhaps even slow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;Parkinson's progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The discovery that autophagy dysfunction drives the neurotoxicity also points us toward potential therapeutic strategies to protect vulnerable brain cells," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/widely-used-pesticide-linked-more-doubled-parkinsons-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bronstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-025-00915-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Neurodegeneration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;This bed routine is even better than traditional floor workouts for building and restoring hip strength.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Whether you realize it or not, your hips are responsible for a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of work. They’re the basis of all movement in the lower body. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/exercises-for-healthy-hips/" target="_blank"&gt;Strong hips&lt;/a&gt; keep you balanced and stable while helping you &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/form-checks-to-prevent-injury-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid back, knee, and ankle injuries&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, strong, healthy hips promote an active, pain-free life. So, we spoke with experts who share the benefits of bed workouts and an eight-minute bed routine that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/exercises-to-strengthen-hips/" target="_blank"&gt;restores hip strength&lt;/a&gt; faster than floor stretches after 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Bed Workouts Are So Effective for the Hips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I specialize in age-related strength loss and joint health, as well as safe movement techniques for older adults. One of the main areas I concentrate on, and the one most critical to maintaining independence and mobility past the age of 65, is the preservation of hip strength,” says &lt;b&gt;Dr. Timur Alptunaer, MD, RN, FACEP&lt;/b&gt;, a sports medicine physician at In House Wellness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bed routine is helpful for older adults in engaging the hip muscles in a productive manner. This kind of workout alleviates any balance challenges and joint compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Physiologically, developing strength comes from active muscle engagement, not from stretching,” Dr. Alptunaer explains. “Movements performed from bed allow for low-load resistance against gravity, while also providing support for alignment. This is more effective for neuromuscular reactivation than static stretching on the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why They Trump Floor Workouts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this routine trump floor stretching? For those 65+, consistency trumps intensity when building and restoring hip strength. Traditional floor workouts typically present barriers rather than solutions because of balance concerns, stiffness, pain, or difficulty getting up from the ground, says &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://memorialhermann.org/doctors/advanced-practice-provider/sean-carpenter-1417394479" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sean Carpenter, PT, DPT, Cert. MDT, Cert. DN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lead Therapist Golf Specialty, Sports Medicine &amp;amp; Rehabilitation with Memorial Hermann Health System.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When exercises are uncomfortable or feel unsafe, adherence drops—and without consistency, strength gains stall. A bed-based routine removes these barriers,” Carpenter adds. “Performing exercises on a supportive surface allows older adults to move with better control, reduced fear of falling, and less muscle guarding. This enables frequent, low-load activation of key hip muscles, which improves neuromuscular control and strength without aggravating symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bed workout promotes joint safety, accessibility, and targeted muscle activation, making it a stellar choice for those 65+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By reducing barriers to daily movement and strengthening the hips in positions that feel safe and manageable, it supports better walking mechanics, balance, and confidence in everyday life,” Carpenter explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform this eight-minute routine daily. Each exercise should be slow, controlled, and free of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="posterior-pelvic-tilts" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posterior Pelvic Tilts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by lying flat on your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly tilt your pelvis backward to engage the hip stabilizers and deep core muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 1 to 2 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A helpful cue [when performing this exercise] is to imagine the pelvis as a bucket of water slowly pouring backward,” says Carpenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back with feet on the mattress and knees bent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place a towel or pillow between your knees, and gently squeeze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathe normally as you hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps; 5-second holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coordinated breathing is important, as the diaphragm works in opposition to the pelvic floor. Individuals with a history of low-back pain often unintentionally hold their breath during effort,” Carpenter notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly lift your hips off the mattress while keeping your heels close to your glutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a posterior pelvic tilt to maximize glute engagement and limit your hamstrings from dominating the movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="side-lying-clamshells-external-and-internal-rotation" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Side-Lying Clamshells (External and Internal Rotation)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie on your side with your knees stacked and bent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the external rotation, your feet should stay together as your knees separate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the internal rotation, your knees should stay together as your feet move apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid rotating through your lower back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 1 to 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps in each direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A small cushion between the knees can help maintain alignment during internal rotation,” Carpenter notes.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="hip-windshield-wipers" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hip Windshield Wipers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated with your knees bent and feet flat on the mattress. Alternatively, lie flat on your back with feet flat and knees bent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gently rotate your legs inward and outward while maintaining a still pelvis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to the point where you feel a mild stretch on each side to boost hip rotation control and joint awareness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 1 set of slow and controlled reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The foot of the moving leg should resemble the motion of a windshield wiper,” Carpenter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/essential-healthy-habits-for-your-twenties-thirties-longevity-advice-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;how simple habits&lt;/a&gt; can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt; and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-uncover-processed-foods-fuel-colon-cancer-how-offset-damage-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and refined sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider  that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: "how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are his three suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;h2 id="f1426ea8-76ac-4bb4-9967-f82aaa75bb88" data-toc-id="f1426ea8-76ac-4bb4-9967-f82aaa75bb88"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Switch from cooking with butter to olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Olive oil contains heart-healthy fats.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Lazy_Bear/Getty Images
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Landry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal products and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/government-eat-more-butter-full-fat-milk-dietary-guidelines-dairy-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;full-fat dairy products&lt;/a&gt; like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or "bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="92ff2c6c-ba8f-4601-94f3-06f8a5c0fe3b" data-toc-id="92ff2c6c-ba8f-4601-94f3-06f8a5c0fe3b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Switch from red meat to poultry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Red and processed meats are linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Johner Images/Getty Images
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled "You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/omnivore-vs-vegan-diet-vegan-lost-more-weight-lower-cholesterol-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;vegan twins&lt;/a&gt; had lower LDL cholesterol and insulin levels, and had lost more weight, another risk factor for cardiovascular disease, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. "Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f2310b17-c86f-481d-9b8f-929fd5162d13" data-toc-id="f2310b17-c86f-481d-9b8f-929fd5162d13"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Swap white carbs for whole-wheat versions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Swap out white toast for wholemeal or seeded bread.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              zimmytws/Getty Images
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiber is great at keeping &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-lowered-cholesterol-4-simple-ways-eat-more-fiber-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;"nice and stable," Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can still have bread, we can still have rice," Landry, said, "but the whole grain version."&lt;/p&gt;
