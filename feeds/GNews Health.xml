While most symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, the “debilitating” joint pain can persist for months or years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." aria-label="World Health Organization."&gt;World Health Organization.&lt;/a&gt; The joint pain is the calling card of chikungunya and, without it, people with the virus can easily be misdiagnosed as having dengue or Zika, making it hard to know exactly how many people are infected. Chikungunya was first detected in southern Tanzania in the 1950s. The name comes from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania that means “that which bends up," meant to describe the contorted posture of people with severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Does Chikungunya Virus Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya can only be transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected mosquito, but people can transmit it right back to the insect. So if a non-infected mosquito bites a person with the chikungunya, it can contract the virus and infect the next healthy person it bites. It is not contagious or transmittable person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Chikungunya Vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are two approved for use in the United States: IXCHIQ, a live-attenuated vaccine, is approved for people 18 and older and VIMKUNYA, a virus-like particle vaccine, is approved for those 12 and older. The CDC only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" aria-label="recommends"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine to people traveling to an area with a chikungunya outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There Chikungunya Virus In The United States?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it's not common. In the U.S., chikungunya is primarily found in travelers who've been infected in other countries and a locally acquired case hasn't been reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" aria-label="since 2019"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But travel-associated cases are on the rise. Chikungunya was rarely found in the U.S. before 2006, but as many as 28 people per year tested positive from 2006 to 2013. Nearly 3,000 travel-associated cases were identified in 2014 but that number steadily decreased down to 36 in 2021 before slowly climbing again. There were 199 cases found in 2024 and, in 2025, there have been 46 cases so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where Chikungunya Virus Most Commonly Found?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" aria-label="warn"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that U.S. travelers visiting Brazil, Columbia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines are at an elevated risk of exposure.

						A Massachusetts mother has identified her newborn daughter as the possible case of Powassan virus that is under investigation by health officials on Martha's Vineyard. Health officials did not disclose where on the island the patient lives, their age or when they were infected. The virus has not been confirmed. Tiffany Sisco said her daughter, Lilly, had seizures and is receiving intensive care, including antibiotics, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  The family is awaiting the final testing results.Tiffany Sisco and her husband, Marcus, said shortly after the baby was born, they took her for a walk along a bike path in West Tisbury, with Lilly in a stroller covered by a blanket. Upon returning home, Tiffany discovered a tiny, pencil-head-sized tick on Lilly's ankle."I picked it off and I called him in and said, 'What do we do?' Because he's more familiar with them being a landscaper. And he said, 'Just throw it away. And we'll monitor her and make sure she doesn't get a rash, a bull's eye, anything like that. Like a week later she started getting a fever of 102. I said, 'I'm taking her right in,'" Tiffany Sisco said.For the first few days, Lilly needed help breathing, and her parents were unable to hold her. Doctors were uncertain if she would survive. The family now hopes to leave the hospital within a week. Tests indicate some signs of brain damage, but doctors are unsure how it may impact Lilly's development.Aside from the pending investigation, there has only been one case of Powassan virus on the island in the past 20 years. Three cases elsewhere in the state have been confirmed this year, officials said.Powassan is a rare but potentially serious virus transmitted by the bite of infected Ixodes scapularis ticks — commonly known as deer ticks. Unlike other tick-borne pathogens, Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of a tick bite. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2004 to 2024, there were 397 Powassan cases nationally with 50 deaths, with almost half of those infections occurring in the last five years.Massachusetts ranks second behind Minnesota in total number of cases in that same time frame, with 71, according to the CDC.So far in 2025, there have been 24 cases in seven states, with three of those recorded in Massachusetts, according to the CDC.There is no specific treatment, vaccine or cure for Powassan virus disease. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, encephalitis, confusion, seizures and long-term neurological complications."The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare," said Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor with longstanding research on Martha’s Vineyard. Telford’s lab has tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. "Between 1 and 2% of nymph deer ticks on Martha’s Vineyard are infected. This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected," Telford said.Top tips to prevent tick bites:    Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin.    Dress “tick-smart” — tuck pants into socks, shirts into pants, wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.        Leggings and snug-fitting clothing can prevent ticks from reaching the skin. Use a lint roller on your clothing after coming in from the outdoors to remove "hitchhikers."        Change clothes or shower soon after being outside.        Put clothes in the dryer on high for 20 minutes to kill ticks.        Do full-body tick checks with a mirrorVideo: Mass. doctor on infant possibly contracting Powassan virus

Unlike other tick-borne pathogens, Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of a tick bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/data-maps/historic-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, from 2004 to 2024, there were 397 Powassan cases nationally with 50 deaths, with almost half of those infections occurring in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts ranks second behind Minnesota in total number of cases in that same time frame, with 71, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;So far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 24 cases in seven states, with three of those recorded in Massachusetts, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment, vaccine or cure for Powassan virus disease. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, encephalitis, confusion, seizures and long-term neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare," said Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor with longstanding research on Martha’s Vineyard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telford’s lab has tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between 1 and 2% of nymph deer ticks on Martha’s Vineyard are infected. This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected," Telford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-h3"&gt;Top tips to prevent tick bites:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;    Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    Dress “tick-smart” — tuck pants into socks, shirts into pants, wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.        Leggings and snug-fitting clothing can prevent ticks from reaching the skin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a lint roller on your clothing after coming in from the outdoors to remove "hitchhikers."        Change clothes or shower soon after being outside.        Put clothes in the dryer on high for 20 minutes to kill ticks.        Do full-body tick checks with a mirror&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video: Mass. doctor on infant possibly contracting Powassan virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to fully fund the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/php/od2a/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Overdose Data to Action or OD2A program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a CDC senior leader. A second CDC staff member confirmed that "there have been developments and we are likely to have full funding," although they did not have details on when the funding would become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity because they fear retribution for speaking to the press without authorization. Some staffers at CDC expressed to NPR that this appeared to be good news, although the funding situation was still fluid and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reported last month that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;was withholding $140 million&lt;/a&gt; from the OD2A program, which state and local public health departments rely on to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previously frozen funding for other CDC programs, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349529/hhs-layoffs-sexual-assault-rape-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;rape and domestic violence prevention&lt;/a&gt;, is also getting released, the senior CDC leader said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Funding, 30 days at a time&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delays were part of a broader issue with funding at CDC. As NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;reported in June&lt;/a&gt;, for months, CDC waited for the $9 billion Congress intended for the agency for fiscal year 2025. In the meantime, it received small amounts of money every 30 days to cover payroll and other limited expenses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader described the process like receiving money "with an eyedropper."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC couldn't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to do their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC," Dr. Scott Harris, who runs Alabama's health department, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;told NPR in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deadlines missed &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health departments across the country sounded the alarm as deadlines approached or passed for CDC funding of HIV prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-cuts-threaten-cancer-screening-state-level-tracking-for-emerging-threats/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer registries&lt;/a&gt; and overdose prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, most of those programs across CDC apparently can continue, including OD2A. Grantees for the OD2A program, who had been told in July they would be receiving only half of their funding, will soon be told they will receive the full amount, according to the senior leader at CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news comes after advocates had been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;warning for weeks&lt;/a&gt; of the harms that delayed or partial funding to the program could have. If full funding is actually coming, "it'll be welcome, but it's not without the toll that it's already taken," says &lt;a href="https://www.safestates.org/page/SharonGilmartin" target="_blank"&gt;Sharon Gilmartin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Safe States Alliance, a public health advocacy group. For instance, NPR reported on a local health department in North Carolina that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;laid off staff&lt;/a&gt; because of CDC funding delays, only to have the funding come through weeks late without explanation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think anybody will feel confident until they have money in hand," Gilmartin adds. "And I'll be honest, I think the concern is that — if this is what we went through this year, even if funding comes through, are we going to be doing this again next year?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was no available explanation from the Trump administration or the Office for Management and Budget for the delays or the release of the funding. OMB and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC senior leader describes the release of funding for the agency as a relief. "It's great we have our apportionment," they tell NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Some funds frozen&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's a new funding challenge. Several dozen specific CDC programs have now had their budget lines frozen at the direction of OMB, according to the senior leader at CDC. The news of the frozen funds was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-cdc-funding-freeze-79e7090f" target="_blank"&gt;by the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The frozen programs are mostly in the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, according to the senior leader at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A list of frozen programs reviewed by NPR includes those that address tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, school health, inflammatory bowel disease, excessive alcohol use, chronic disease education and awareness, national diabetes prevention program, oral health, epilepsy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"What does it all mean?"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for five programs at the CDC's Injury Center was frozen by OMB as well, including youth violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, firearm injury, injury control research centers, and injury prevention activities. Gilmartin of the Safe States Alliance says it's hard to understand why these programs were targeted. "I can't come up with an ideological reason why you would want to cut funding that supports positive early childhood," for instance, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader at CDC says there are some big questions for OMB and the Trump administration: "How do we interpret all of this? What does it all mean?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There were whole teams fired during the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih" target="_blank"&gt;dramatic reduction in force&lt;/a&gt; across HHS in April that appear to have full funding, the senior leader says, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sexual-violence/programs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rape Prevention and Education&lt;/a&gt; Program. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are programs with their budget lines frozen by OMB that are fully staffed, and still other priorities set forth in President Trump's 2026 budget, they say, which leaves the impression that there's no overarching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

(WLOS) — &lt;/span&gt;Health officials confirm an investigation is underway after a person with a confirmed case of tuberculosis (TB) spent time in Jackson County during their infectious period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Aug. 5, 2025, news release, the Jackson County Department of Public Health (JCDPH) said it is working with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Division of Public Health on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the TB diagnosis was confirmed, county officials said they took immediate steps to protect the public, including isolating and treating the infected individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/back-to-school/13th-whooping-cough-case-confirmed-haywood-county-health-human-services-pertussis-prevention-vaccine-centers-disease-control" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/back-to-school/13th-whooping-cough-case-confirmed-haywood-county-health-human-services-pertussis-prevention-vaccine-centers-disease-control" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;13TH WHOOPING COUGH CASE CONFIRMED IN HAYWOOD COUNTY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed contact investigation is also underway to identify people who may have been exposed to the disease. Jackson County officials said those identified as having close contact with the TB case will be notified directly by a public health official and offered testing, education, and follow-up care at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our priority is the health and well-being of everyone in Jackson County," Public Health Director Anna Lippard said. "We are working carefully to identify and support those who may have been exposed, and we're committed to keeping the community informed every step of the way. If you have not been contacted directly by the health department, there is no need to seek testing at this time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB is a serious disease, county officials say it is treatable and the risk to the general public remains low. Those with questions or concerns are asked to contact the JCDPH at 828-586-8994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;HAYWOOD COUNTY DEPUTY BITTEN BY UNVACCINATED DOGS, RABIES VACCINATIONS STRESSED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About tuberculosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;provisional report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the country has been increasing since 2021. The report stated there were 10,347 TB cases in the U.S. in 2024, up from 9,633 cases in 2023. North Carolina followed the nationwide trend, with 215 cases reported in 2023 and 250 cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active cases of tuberculosis often affect the lungs and spread through the air when coughing, speaking, or singing. It is not spread through casual contact, like touching surfaces, shaking hands, or sharing food or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson County officials said those sick with TB often have one or more of these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough lasting more than 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profuse sweating at night, often soaking the bed sheets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;CDC.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information on the disease and prevention measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxPRzZFTlU5NzJydFIxNTFNb3ctZ0FGOV85NmpYVXlENnB0NlhxQWVqY1JBa3dWRW1FbU45bFN0aGdCWjR4anFiUHdDSmpjVlJJYnRXTnA2c3ZUTWhQWWpVS3g5eHhKZXJ4R29sY3Q1MkxUSEpqemFyRWVtMGhjTnMtWXY0ZVdPcm5xdUl5Y2M2dTF2bVZGdkExM2F5VThTQWU4NWR4NjNLLWFyNHQwZW9MME92ZklSS0o5WDJRSGRhLURHWW5yZHZMRzFqN2E3R3pHNW9ONjN0OU05WGxtVUljODFrbWVQY1N0UmFnR0dPdUtNa2VDYjNmejc3QmVaa3pPbmp0d1hUZldabjZPem0zY1pkSFo0S0h5YlFv</guid></item><item><title>世界几乎击败了脊髓灰质炎。但伪造的记录，不完美的疫苗和失误帮助其卷土重来- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBTSEtmRGpqUldlYnFOYUdkVkdCd25QUmduOXJyZjluU01YMzVJbWNvYVlZb3dtUTctcktqZ2pWSFc0cEQ3dVhjYThSQ0V0aEF2dnlpQlQ4U1JxalNDVnh2QUpLQnk0VkpSZnlCWG81ejJFQdIBd0FVX3lxTE01LUhPV1dlejNXUWtLb0M4aFhsSXFhUWJMaFFLaXloMFl2Q28wNzNWRFBMMFFoMmZ2QkFoS2IwdVI5WjdfRnd6aElkT1R0VVVfdGNMT216aEx4YVpfcU5lLUR6WXhrVWVET1pqQ0RkdkJtZTJSQjM4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/pakistan" target="_blank"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-gaza-baby-225d4997a8dec1b2ce7d91711ee3d47d" target="_blank"&gt;against polio&lt;/a&gt; as part of a global campaign to wipe out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjhtdlddI0" target="_blank"&gt;the paralytic disease&lt;/a&gt;. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical – families need basics like food and water more &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-tetanus-vaccine-children-preventable-disease-e33a36e55d70381e4659874a2ecb371a" target="_blank"&gt;than vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Others are simply unfounded – the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00023b6nevuiq716@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren’t always stored correctly, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00033b6n8o0xllvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many places, our work is not done with honesty,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00043b6nx2cbw6wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and partners embarked on their &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-campaign-who-gates-afghanistan-pakistan-341b1da7b7c33dbffa33fe9d9a52065e" target="_blank"&gt;polio campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/d98f518c5f074c609a4e086eb1a1e02f" target="_blank"&gt;with smallpox&lt;/a&gt; in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-launched-polio-vaccination-campaign-96bb8b0644a6e4951d48a1a55bafce32" target="_blank"&gt;in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-polio-vaccination-campaign-suspend-9fc299a2e72dddf81f913da9f7f05e81" target="_blank"&gt;and Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00053b6n41axdbb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours – has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00063b6n37vg7iii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-united-nations-ap-top-news-pakistan-international-news-7d8b0e32efd0480fbd12acf27729f6a5" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00073b6ndhdaxz4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-oral-vaccine-linked-to-rare-infection-risk-db2b278b7e4f9fea9a2df48b8508ed14" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine sparking outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00083b6nfuwvs9rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00093b6nk9lu35vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPEI_generalfactsheet_25-April-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;tout the successes&lt;/a&gt; – 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared – while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-gunmen-kill-police-polio-worker-northwest-7c027ca903c282ff3f0b82973cead3aa" target="_blank"&gt;polio workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-polio-security-officials-attacked-balochistan-1acffdfd67252701828e570d142e3b75" target="_blank"&gt;security staff&lt;/a&gt; have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000a3b6nrq8ewtg2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO’s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers’ tailored response in resistant pockets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000b3b6n4ne2aqo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,” he said. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000c3b6nb6dwu91d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000d3b6nj875d9k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-philanthropy-berlin-c3e0441a186a17a060d83d9c7c7a9dba" target="_blank"&gt;the Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000e3b6nlb9qoede@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Continuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000f3b6n1cqfblxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000g3b6ns8bipba6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000h3b6n00j9tzs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, “vaccinators did not know about vaccine management,” citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000i3b6ni09ouq8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000j3b6n4wmzdo2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000k3b6n1pxq48ae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region’s poverty and transience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000l3b6nb15lg81d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,” said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the press. “Many people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000m3b6n1ze41i8w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000n3b6nr41eqoad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have shared these problems with our senior officials,” the worker told AP. “They know about it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000o3b6nre1ob7j9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000p3b6nzavuahwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000q3b6n78qskce9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is so much pressure,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000r3b6ndsnduznr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-567c9fae1e50ba4f7d833dfb7f7617b6" target="_blank"&gt;most feared&lt;/a&gt;, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000s3b6n6a1rdbvp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000t3b6npmz4w1g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000u3b6n1z37ilp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eradication demands near-perfection – zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000v3b6nmlw7kgb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But public health leaders and former WHO staffers say campaign efforts are far from perfect, and many question the oral vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000w3b6nkmct7okz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oral vaccine – proven to be safe and effective — has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000x3b6n9e1yiv2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000y3b6nz3o30d98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000z3b6neoxohht1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn’t enough injectable vaccine — which uses no live virus and doesn’t come with the risks of the oral vaccine — to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00103b6nmn6lzxxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00113b6nnjr5jfmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he’s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00123b6ncoaojjbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no management,” he said, citing a lack of accountability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00133b6nf8wzspid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a “major course correction.” John shared the emails with AP and said he’s received no response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00143b6n2ro4yejo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,” John wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00153b6n5rq5xmcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00163b6nwl4qyb31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00173b6nskoj9m81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00183b6nhr5npn2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, nearly all of the world’s polio cases – mostly in Africa and the Middle East – are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00193b6nisxm4mfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-baby-polio-vaccine-who-aa79e32d45aa59f26274898c22885ba8" target="_blank"&gt;paralyzed a baby in Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001a3b6ncbkdafpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001b3b6neknycg9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-trump-tedros-global-health-a2eafc341cd2200e8800a2421d30bdfc" target="_blank"&gt;withdrew from WHO&lt;/a&gt;, and President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16" target="_blank"&gt;cut foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001c3b6nrco6tzh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001d3b6n9xuo8zbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “If this was a private company, we would demand results.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001e3b6nwy3321l3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001f3b6n1gyijra1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Karachi, locals told AP they didn’t understand the government’s fixation on polio and complained of other issues — dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001g3b6np69poajl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" target="_blank"&gt;anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt; growing &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a" target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it’s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001h3b6ncxtphpp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family’s objections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001i3b6nw7xkvbty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It results in disability,” said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001j3b6noyhlasx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/measles" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/tuberculosis" target="_blank"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001k3b6nh4a9k7iy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Polio eradication has created a monster,” Closser said. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/f081f1f8fbfa401ea148cea2fcf43c28" target="_blank"&gt;CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001l3b6nw6lgw2kb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Workers see that continued mistrust every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001m3b6nmn22xqqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she’d prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children’s fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001n3b6n86hgun41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I allow it,” the woman said, declining to be named over fears of family retribution, “I will be beaten and thrown out.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

same urgency as other epidemics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Den, radiation oncologist and chief medical officer at Alpha Tau Medical in Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital that there is a "concerning rise" in these cancers, particularly colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic and postmenopausal &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/breast-cancer" rel="nofollow

particularly colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic and postmenopausal breast cancer, a doctor said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alarmingly, these cancers are increasing not only in older adults, but also in younger patients — a trend we didn’t see a generation ago," said Den, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These cancers tend to be more aggressive, harder to treat and costly to manage," he added. "The sheer number of people at risk, combined with the rising obesity rates, means we’re looking at increased cancer burdens on individuals, families and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthcare systems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting healthy body weight through a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:balanced diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular physical activity and less alcohol consumption are important steps toward reducing cancer risk, according to Den, as well as cancer screenings and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As physicians, we advocate for broader &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public health efforts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;public health efforts&lt;/a&gt; — like better nutrition education, access to healthier foods and environments that support active living," he said. "Additionally, new technologies and therapies represent a novel paradigm for the management of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preventing obesity is cancer prevention, and taking proactive steps now can improve long-term health outcomes across the population," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Promoting healthy body weight through a balanced diet, regular physical activity and less alcohol consumption can help reduce the risk of cancer, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Decotiis, M.D., a medical weight-loss doctor in New York City, noted in a separate interview with Fox News Digital that the use of obesity and diabetes drugs, like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GLP-1 medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;, has been associated with reducing cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is one of the most impactful medical advancements we have had in a very long time," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the doctor, "angry, inflamed fat cells," called cytokines, are produced in large amounts in obese individuals, which can "bully and override" the body’s normal regulations, often leading to immune disruption and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Decotiis recommended seeing a certified weight-loss physician for an appropriate weight-loss plan, which could include GLP-1 medication.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to early cancer screenings, Decotiis recommends &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; as a critical way to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shedding extra pounds can help reduce inflammation in the body by reducing cytokines, which also prevents cancers, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems more prudent to aggressively treat obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as clean up our food supply, instead of waiting for cancer to develop and hoping we can catch it and successfully treat it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take the state of being overweight and obese seriously," Decotiis advised.

In that same report, Mississippi ranked 5th for gonorrhea and 2nd for chlamydia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Syphilis, like other sexually transmitted diseases, is spread through bacteria upon contact with infected fluids; this usually happening through sex or various sex acts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The tiny corkscrew-like organism is a spirochete, or germ, of syphilis, as seen under the special "darkfield" microscope used in diagnosis of that disease, seen Sept. 28, 1937.  It's average length is 3/10,000 of an inch, or approximately the diameter of a red blood cell.  (AP Photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;With most STDs, the symptoms can make themselves known in a plethora of ways, including painful sores, a burning sensation, or a type of discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;What makes syphilis different, and in some ways harder to detect, is that, at first, its symptoms can be minor - if any at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Kayla Stover, professor and vice chair of pharmacy practice at The University of Mississippi, explained that a symptom one might have in the first stage of syphilis is a painless sore, or chancre, that would go away even without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But though it is no longer visibly apparent, says Dr. Stover, the disease, if left untreated, could lie undetected in the body for years. And while lying undetected, the disease could slowly progress in its victim’s body, leading to more damaging stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“And each of those stages has symptoms that could be mistaken for something else,” Dr. Stover says, which is why the disease is often referred to as “The Great Imitator.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Unless you are testing for syphilis, you might not know it’s there,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In its second stage, or secondary syphilis, a rash might appear, usually on the palms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;It’s important to note here that in its early stages, syphilis is easily treatable, usually only requiring a shot of penicillin. But left untreated, the disease could continue to evolve, and one might enter the third stage: latent syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In this stage, the disease could cause damage to internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The last stage, tertiary syphilis, is the disease at its most severe, causing damage to the brain or heart. Paralysis and dementia are possible during this stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;During all four stages, the carrier would still be infectious, possibly spreading it to various sexual partners. And if you are a mother, it could also spread to your child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;This is called congenital syphilis, and Mississippi has seen a 1,000% spike in the past few years, from 10 cases in 2016 to 110 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In congenital syphilis, the child is infected either in utero or as the child is being born. The complications of the now-infected child, says Dr. Stover, could either be mild or could lead to the child’s death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Also of note: a rising population contracting syphilis is the age range from 14 to 24 years old. In those populations, a threat from the disease is infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Those are some of the challenges [from obtaining syphilis],” says Dr. Stover. “As simple as you’re putting other people at risk, to you could be damaging, long-term, your life, your children, your expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Deja Abdul-Haqq, the director of My Brother’s Keeper, a local nonprofit focusing on public health, says they began seeing a spike in syphilis cases after the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;As for the reason for the spike, she said, “To break it down really simple: condomless sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This April 1, 2016 file photos shows a billboard above a gas station that reads "Feel The Burn," a play on then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' campaign slogan, "Feel The Bern." It's actually promoting testing for sexually transmitted diseases. The number of cases of STDs - chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis - in California reached a record high in 2017,and officials are particularly concerned by a spike in stillbirths due to congenital syphilis, state health authorities said Monday, May 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(Nick Ut | AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Abdul-Haqq would say there is a lack of information regarding condom use in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. While this would seemingly be a basic concept to most, in Mississippi, it’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In Mississippi schools, sex-education classes cannot include instruction and demonstrations on how to use a condom. In 2015, a teacher in Starkville &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/3abd7740ee5b4d419fbdfbcd8a094d57" target="_self" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/3abd7740ee5b4d419fbdfbcd8a094d57"&gt;was suspended&lt;/a&gt; after a student in her class put a prophylactic on a cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;That same year, a teacher went viral &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/meet-the-brilliant-mississippi-teacher-who-used-a-sock-to-te" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/meet-the-brilliant-mississippi-teacher-who-used-a-sock-to-te"&gt;for side-stepping the condom rule&lt;/a&gt; by demonstrating how to put a sock on a foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Likewise, there is the lack, in Abdul-Haqq’s eyes, of information pertaining to modern prevention tools like PrEP, a medication which can prevent HIV infection, and Doxy-PEP, another medication that can prevent STDs such as syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Imagine if all of these mothers that were exposed to syphilis during sex would have gotten Doxy-PEP within 72 hours,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Stover would echo some of Abdul-Haqq’s same points, saying that Mississippi’s sex education has not been as progressive as other states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;And in the era of medications such as PrEP and Doxy-PEP, Dr. Stover says that people may not be as scared of unprotected sex as they used to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to recent data, Black men in Mississippi have higher rates of syphilis than others. A &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page//resources/6015.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://msdh.ms.gov/page//resources/6015.pdf"&gt;2019 MSDH report&lt;/a&gt; found that of the 690 cases of primary and secondary syphilis that year, 338 were in Black men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The second-highest rate was found in Black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The information regarding the solution to these issues usually gets to the Black communities late,” Abdul-Haqq said. “So, it’s not so much the individual, it’s the environment that does not promote access to all of these prevention methods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Throughout the years, &lt;a href="https://www.sunherald.com/news/health/article125868159.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.sunherald.com/news/health/article125868159.html"&gt;billboard campaigns&lt;/a&gt; arose in the state and across the country in an effort to raise awareness about STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The billboards, initiated by the AIDs Healthcare Foundation, have phrases on them such as “STDs are Timeless” and “Testing is Caring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The same foundation &lt;a href="https://www.aidshealth.org/2025/03/ahfs-bold-billboard-campaign-stresses-syphilis-is-curable/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.aidshealth.org/2025/03/ahfs-bold-billboard-campaign-stresses-syphilis-is-curable/"&gt;also has a billboard campaign&lt;/a&gt; focusing on syphilis; those billboards reading things like “Syphilis is Curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While well-intentioned, Abdul-Haqq says these billboard campaigns may not be doing enough for those who may need the information the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Culturally and aesthetically, it doesn’t engage the Black community, and the message is too vague,” she said. “We have to hit people with data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want more WLBT news in your inbox? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wlbt.com/newsletter/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to subscribe to our newsletter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo13yd000o3b79ofc39vup@published"&gt;My husband had diabetes and obesity-induced erectile dysfunction for a decade, which, after significant weight loss, has improved. His dick does get hard now! But the moment it senses pussy, it can’t stay that way. Having penetrative sex is important to me, and I married him anyway because I know this is a fixable issue. Science cares about boners!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo140m000p3b79ftgfur13@published"&gt;He’s tried all the different drugs, and they help, but we still can’t get there. I even had to do IVF because we couldn’t even attempt to get pregnant the traditional way. At this point, I’ve given up and feel resentful about the IVF, frustrated that it took him so long to deal with it in the first place, hurt that he won’t keep looking for solutions, and sad that I’ve signed up to never get fucked again. He insists that non-monogamy is off the table for us. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="1" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo142n000q3b79au0ggxp9@published"&gt;—Never&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo146i000s3b79x7q4vuxd@published"&gt;It’s possible that erectile dysfunction medication simply isn’t enough. Often, soft or absent erections are at least partially caused by a person’s mental state, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/marriage-advice-wife-cheating-accusation.html"&gt;as licensed marriage and family therapist Moushumi Ghose shared with us in a recent column&lt;/a&gt;. So while your husband’s issue is probably fixable with the right support, it absolutely requires his own desire to find a solution, which very much seems to be absent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo148g000t3b79k0tckji8@published"&gt;Unfortunately, you married him thinking that as long as he found the right pill, this would be resolved. Sadly, this isn’t always the case—and that is indeed disappointing. Take some time to process your feelings around this. You might need several weeks. Talking with a trusted and sympathetic friend would be helpful. Once you’ve worked through any frustration with yourself, anger at a lack of education around these subjects, and new layers of emotions toward your husband, start considering your remaining options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo14c7000v3b79dg2getw7@published"&gt;Think through whether this issue is a dealbreaker for you, either because penetration is important to you or because you want a husband who is able and willing to put in the effort to engage in finding a solution. Think long and hard, with as clear a mind as you can, because saying any version of “I feel these awful emotions, and need you to do something in order to be willing to stay in the relationship” is nearly impossible to come back from when the answer is anything other than agreeable. Also consider whether you’re likely to be satisfied even if he does follow through on dildos or pumps and they work—will that be enough, at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo14e7000w3b79gpsbgmzz@published"&gt;When you’ve mulled over your options and can approach your husband calmly, start the conversation. Let your husband know that you’re miserable. Leave space for him to process and respond, and be prepared to take a few-hour or days-long breaks, as this discussion might need to happen in chunks, for both of your sakes. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I have three young children and a satisfying sex life. We have a closed relationship and, although I fantasize about other women and watch porn, I don’t want to hook up with anyone else. Also, I love dancing. I like to dance at home alone or with my kids, with my wife at a party, and (very occasionally) out with friends at a bar or club. I’m conventionally handsome and a better dancer than people expect, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/10/married-dancing-with-other-women-at-clubs-advice.html"&gt;and I sometimes end up dancing with strangers when I’m out, especially when it starts getting late.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said that Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated if it’s caught early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3oa1q"&gt;The affected ZIP codes include 10027, 10030,10035, 10037, and 10039 as well as surrounding communities, according to the city health department. Those ZIP codes generally stretch across Harlem from 116th to 155th streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b82re"&gt;The city reported the first death on July 30. At the time, there were 22 confirmed cases related to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="95qt8"&gt;Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia, is caused by exposure to Legionella bacteria, which can grow in the water cooling towers perched atop many buildings across the city. People who inhale infected water vapor can be infected. It can cause flu-like symptoms including cough, fever, chills, muscle aches or difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8io47"&gt;The city said Monday that 11 buildings that screened positive for the bacteria have completed remediation efforts such as cleaning the affected cooling towers or making changes to the chemical solutions used to treat them. That follows a July 30 order by the city health department that called for all cooling towers in the affected area to be screened for Legionella and to take steps to remediate it if the bacteria was detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e877r"&gt;The city has not released the addresses of the 11 Harlem buildings where the bacteria was detected. A public health lab is still working to identify which specific cooling tower or towers were responsible for getting people sick, said Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department. Once the source is identified, the city will order a more thorough cleaning and remediation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9csin"&gt;These remediation measures are expected to prevent more people from getting infected, Gomez said. She added that the city still expects more cases of Legionnaires’ disease to be reported in the area because it can take several days after someone’s infected for symptoms to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="arv4t"&gt;Health officials say the Legionnaires’ cluster is not tied to an issue with any building’s plumbing system and people living in affected ZIP codes are able to drink the tap water, shower, cook and use air conditioning at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2r6bo"&gt;City health officials say people are at higher risk for severe symptoms from Legionnaires if they are over 50, smokers, or have chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1do87"&gt;Over the past decade, several hundred cases of Legionnaires’ have been reported in New York City each year. Last year, 257 cases were reported, according to preliminary data from the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8eh91"&gt;In 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/5-deaths-at-nyc-nursing-home-blamed-on-legionnaires-disease/3956035/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;five people died&lt;/a&gt; from Legionnaires’ amid an outbreak at a Manhattan nursing home — the worst outbreak in the city since a 2015 outbreak in which a Bronx cooling tower was linked to 16 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2a61k"&gt;The disease takes its name from a respiratory illness that killed 34 people and sickened 221 at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/online/story-of-cdc/legionnaires/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bellevue-Stratford&lt;/a&gt; Hotel in Philadelphia, during an American Legion convention in 1976. After an extensive investigation, the disease was linked to a newly discovered pathogen, dubbed the Legionella bacteria, found in the hotel air conditioning system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 15:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPRW5xYUYyRnNQYTNlM3JaZ3h1NzdTajQtVkFsVm1FSE55d3B3WXczSkhMV2ZuR0g2UGJjdVFSejZXN1R2aXNIdERETklqVFJUa0FQTDlDZ0VHeTR0dkkwRFZVdDhkN2tfLTVyV1doYy1GNU9OUjV1Z3NwWFVDeTh2WDU3bnNjVEpEc2cw</guid></item><item><title>中国的灭蚊行动考验一座城市在新冠疫情后的耐心--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOQ3VqR2VCUlFhajFXcDR0c1BucmUxZGxlQk9Cb1pKbFhiZ29STXZQU1BUUUcwaDVNcUY2YTJBcVVEM3Vvakx0dWhTN0JfT2dhaV9aUE5aM1AzQjMzcGFyZ2RaRjR0MDRQcE5vUXRISWxPcHlyMzBlenRYUzQtOGQ5VWJtOVNiczZUdGplWUNBbFhuQnBpMHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 14:44:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOQ3VqR2VCUlFhajFXcDR0c1BucmUxZGxlQk9Cb1pKbFhiZ29STXZQU1BUUUcwaDVNcUY2YTJBcVVEM3Vvakx0dWhTN0JfT2dhaV9aUE5aM1AzQjMzcGFyZ2RaRjR0MDRQcE5vUXRISWxPcHlyMzBlenRYUzQtOGQ5VWJtOVNiczZUdGplWUNBbFhuQnBpMHc</guid></item><item><title>当您同时服用维生素D和钙时，您的骨骼健康会发生什么？ - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOYThHd2QtdVllRDZhakZNUVlMYWN6eHBpRGRXVHREVWtMSmhUZUtVVGc0VGwzVnVoLUFHTnh3U2Z3RWJSRkk5LTRhWTFxVmtVd1N6TkZsT3czU01DVmF4SVNzZWZrZGVZT1pZbFZ6QlRnRlc2VXhEMzktUUNaRTEteWtkanZuYXhBTmFRS2JWVmNOOXZnUVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calcium and vitamin D are both essential nutrients for maintaining strong, healthy bones.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's always best to aim to get nutrients from food first if possible, Guevara said, as nutrients in food are easier for the body to absorb and utilize.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This may mean incorporating more &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-calcium-snacks-11765792" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; such as:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may also mean consuming more &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; such as:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Allen said &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;food sources for vitamin D are limited&lt;/a&gt; as these foods only contain small amounts of the hormone, so supplements are often needed to help people get enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunlight can help your body make vitamin D naturally, but too much sun exposure poses other health risks such as skin cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "About 10 to 30 minutes of sun exposure, a few times per week, can be enough for some people, depending on location and season," she said. "Darker skin tones may need more time in the sun to produce the same amount of vitamin D."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-you-may-need-a-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When You May Need a Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you spend most of your time indoors or wear sunscreen daily, which Allen notes is important for skin protection, a supplement is often the most reliable way to meet your needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are going to take a supplement, Guevara said it is important to note that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/new-guidelines-supplemental-vitamin-d-8666125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;upper limit of vitamin D for adults&lt;/a&gt; is 4,000IU per day. Since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-vs-d3-7153133" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin&lt;/a&gt;, it can be stored in the body and build up over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new supplements, always talk to your health care provider to discuss what's right for your unique health and needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take calcium and vitamin D supplements, try taking them together. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium in the gut, so taking them in tandem can ensure you're getting the most benefits from these nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

According to the New York City health department, “Legionnaires’ disease can be caused by plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for legionella growth, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The disease cannot be transmitted person to person but can be contracted from breathing water vapor with the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The department noted it had completed remediation for 11 cooling towers that tested positive for initial positive results for the presence of &lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt;, a type of bacteria that causes legionnaires’ disease.

            This year, people are seeking emergency care for tick bites in the highest level since 2017, according to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-research/facts-stats/tick-bite-data-tracker.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, and reported cases of Lyme disease have continued to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/surveillance-data-1.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_1-interactive-data" target="_blank"&gt; rise through the years.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdygslsw00023b6n24we56m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the increases are driven by warmer temperatures due to climate change and the expanding presence of ticks in more areas in the US and Canada — including places where people are less familiar with the risks and how to prevent disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf7wc7000e3b6nb5r5ag1o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we first started doing this [in the mid-1980s], there were very few cases of Lyme disease reported in Canada. Lyme disease is pretty well established in Canada at this point,” said Dr. Thomas Daniels, the director of the Louis Calder Center, Fordham University’s biological field station.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf8cov000h3b6n00y641l3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyme disease-carrying deer ticks are&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease" target="_blank"&gt; mostly active&lt;/a&gt; when temperatures are above 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and they thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf9idg000k3b6nwfge3lna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It likes to be in humid areas, not wet areas, but humid areas,” said Daniels. “If you sample on a lawn that gets baked in the sun all day, you’re not going to find ticks. You go 20 feet into the woods where it’s shady and the temperature’s generally lower and there’s more ground cover, you will find ticks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf9og6000n3b6nulry7cjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The threat from ticks and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/world/mosquitoes-spread-climate-dengue-malaria-scn"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, which drive transmission of diseases such as West Nile, dengue and malaria, is already increasing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyf1apz00043b6nd42k6n9n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because of increases in temperature that we’ve already seen, because of human impacts on the climate, the temperature is already getting more suitable for transmission of disease here in the United States and North America,” Dr. Erin Mordecai, an associate professor of biology at Stanford University, said at a news briefing on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxitkrz000l3b6no6gbnsh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while climate change is contributing to the expansion of tick habitats, it’s not the sole driver. Human changes to landscapes also shape where ticks are found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdxitkrz000m3b6nk6guf5ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s never just one factor, right?” Dr. Jean Tsao, a professor at Michigan State University who studies disease ecology, said at a news briefing. “In the continental US, most of the changes in the range is probably due to land use change affecting wildlife communities. Also management of wildlife populations, such as the white-tailed deer. That plays a major role for many of these ticks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv200073b6n5gkbqd3p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deer ticks, also known as black-legged ticks, are the primacy ticks that carry Lyme disease. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, the ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss. As they feed on blood, they can transmit pathogens, including the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This transmission occurs through the tick’s saliva, which enters the host’s bloodstream during feeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv200083b6n7n26109a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brian Fallon, director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, told CNN on Friday that infection can cause a range of multisystem symptoms. Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria can go to various parts of the body including the heart, central nervous system, the brain or peripheral nerves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv200093b6n78lukcru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The onset of Lyme disease may also present in different ways.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000a3b6nohswcovy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most people think of the Lyme rash as a bull’s-eye target rash. In fact, that’s not the most common presentation,” said Fallon. “The most common presentation is more of a pinkish, reddish rash. But the main thing is that it expands in size from a small rash to five centimeters or larger.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000b3b6nsytivmfu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fallon notes that some people may also see more than one rash on different parts of their body. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. Symptoms may last for months or even years, said Fallon.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000c3b6nvnxbuw63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s recognized mainly by the rash early on, if you’re lucky enough to see it, and then later, by symptoms such as the neurologic symptoms that may manifest as a facial palsy or a meningitis causing severe headaches with stiff neck or shooting pains or severe stabbing pains,” Fallon said. There may be cardiac symptoms such as palpitations or slow rhythms; muscle pain and fatigue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyfpnof000w3b6nlc8qku8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It can be profoundly debilitating,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000e3b6n94oq9d0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daniels says that although there are measures that can be taken to decrease the likelihood of a tick bite, prevention methods are not foolproof. The most important protection against Lyme disease is tick removal as soon as possible, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000f3b6n7140ba4k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key is to get the tick off you as quickly as possible. None of these [tick-borne] pathogens are transmitted very quickly, except for Powassan virus, which can be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes. But the infection rate for [humans] is very, very low,” said Daniels. “For Lyme disease, you’ve got a 24 to 48 hour window of opportunity there to get the tick off, because it takes some time for the tick to gear up through its feeding to actually transmit the bacteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000g3b6nxfokfxgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daniels advises people to wear more clothes in the summertime. “The longer we can keep the tick on the outside of our bodies and not on our skin, the less likely it is to find a place to attach.” Clothes can also be treated with permethrin, an insecticide that repels ticks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000h3b6n1e3fq7kq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When hiking, Fallon advises people to stay on the trail, as ticks roam in leafy areas and wood piles. Daniels advises people to conduct a “tick check” for themselves and each other if they’re in an area with ticks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyft8x8000y3b6naarzv1hi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s helpful because the ticks may go behind your knee, or they may go and bite you in the back, and you can’t see your back or reach your back. Take a shower at the end of the day, because that may help to wash off some ticks that haven’t fully attached yet,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000i3b6nsqr8mpru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If a tick is attached for a prolonged period of time, Fallon says that it would gradually “blow as big as a raisin” from continuously sucking blood. If you do find a tick, experts advise people to use tweezers to take out the tick from underneath its body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdx7kqv2000j3b6nj2vtgu4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Don’t try to burn it off with a cigarette. Don’t try to put anything toxic on it. Remove it with a tweezer,” he said.

None of the sufferers shared family ties, yet all were regular foragers of wild mushrooms. A decade-long probe by French and American scientists traced the common thread to meals featuring the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;false morel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a deceptive look-alike of its gourmet cousin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49586"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still remember my first mushroom hunt in the hills, &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/antonio-gates-the-heart-and-soul-of-chargers-football-history/" data-type="post" data-id="49555"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heart &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;pounding as I twisted mushrooms from mossy logs—only to be told later that one in ten was toxic. That mix-up can feel harmless after a nervous laugh, but in Montchavin it had far graver consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Lessons_from_Guam_toxins_beyond_the_forest_floor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Lessons from Guam: toxins beyond the forest floor&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough came when toxicologists recalled a similar outbreak on Guam, where traditional cycad seeds caused a spike in ALS-like cases. Documented by the Motor Neurone Disease Association, that tragedy revealed how certain natural compounds can stealthily attack nerve cells. By comparing local diets, researchers discovered that gyromitra mushrooms contain hydrazine toxins acting on the nervous system much like the cycad neurotoxin did in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Environmental factors are likely contributors in up to 90% of sporadic ALS cases,” notes the Association, underscoring that even familiar foods can harbour hidden dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="False_morels_a_prized_delicacy_with_caveats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;False morels: a prized delicacy with caveats&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being cherished in parts of Finland and Eastern Europe, false morels carry a potential &lt;strong&gt;toxic punch&lt;/strong&gt;. Their hydrazine derivatives can cause anything from nausea to long-term neuronal damage when consumed repeatedly. The European Food Safety Authority recommends either rigorous identification by experts or steering clear of these mushrooms altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a backpacking trip, I once admired a friend cooking what we thought were true morels over a campfire—only to see her wince with stomach cramps later. Since then, I stick to cultivated varieties and leave the wild experiments to mytrusted foragers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Montchavin revelation is a timely reminder: when it comes to wild edibles, curiosity must be tempered by caution. If you love mushroom season, pair your enthusiasm with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/this-is-the-worlds-healthiest-food-according-to-scientists/" data-type="post" data-id="49507"&gt;food &lt;/a&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; protocols—consult field guides, join foraging groups or buy from certified suppliers. After all, the difference between a delightful dinner and a neurological nightmare can be thinner than a mushroom cap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Chicago Audible</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPSmN5VHo1WFdJOVdXR1R2RjUyLXh0VHlwVTVVMU1Jb3NFdXB6UE5hUVlBUm8wSUJPQ1oxanp1Z1JzTXljb25iaTJUWERKUkN1NU9MRFlqRnlqd1lvQXFwOEMzVlJpRGpmejBoMC1kcDY0OENYT0hGVGRHcHRlMkY5SW52X28zTE9GRHVzVWdTNWx3aWk4ODVaUk5Vam1mMzlMb0E</guid></item><item><title>墨西哥湾沿岸正在出现“食肉”细菌病例。您需要了解的信息。-雅虎主页</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQMEhTT18wbDFYaUpHbDVaakVYRm9BcTFKQS1URGlSS1BHNGNxZWZiVzBvbGVBam9QZmVuY3dYX2RyRzJHTkJUSWF4SmQ1M3g1aE9DX1lhdUhpX0g1R29rUXludFE1MjJOS0hvN0FXd0txZ0RoTXJyOVFtcU1fOTJtZHhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As temperatures continue to swelter and people flock to the Gulf Coast to enjoy its warm, salty waters, health officials are warning swimmers about a "flesh-eating" bacteria that has killed at least eight people this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bacterium, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2025/08/03/flesh-eating-bacteria-brain-eating-amoebas-explained/85444558007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:Vibrio vulnificus, is commonly associated with the "flesh-eating";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;Vibrio vulnificus, is commonly associated with the "flesh-eating"&lt;/a&gt; moniker thanks to its ability to cause infections that damage or "eat away" at skin and tissue.

Different types of Vibrio bacteria cause different infections, with Vibrio vulnificus causing the "most serious forms of vibriosis," according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The potentially fatal infection can quickly result in tissue damage and spreading blisters, low blood pressure, fever, organ damage, sepsis and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is often referred to as "flesh-eating" because it can also cause necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection that destroys muscle and skin tissue, causing flesh around wounds to die, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt; While it is possible, Vibrio vulnificus is not considered to be the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bacteria and resulting infections are rare but can be life-threatening. Without treatment, death can occur in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How does 'flesh-eating' bacteria enter the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus requires salt water for survival and thrives in warm, brackish water where a stream or river meets seawater, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pre-protect-wounds-from-coastal-waters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most infections occur when contaminated water is swallowed or gets into an open wound, such as a cut or scrape. It can enter through broken skin but cannot penetrate unharmed skin. Vibrio vulnificus can also enter your body when you eat uncooked or undercooked shellfish, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/vibrio-and-oysters.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:especially oysters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;especially oysters&lt;/a&gt;.

As a result, the family says, Nicholas nearly died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Business Briefing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Become a business insider with the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For more than a year and a half now, Nicholas and his parents have been coping with the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/FDKATIUUNFAPVEJ4SBMMKHSPTY.jpg?auth=920a852105d309da33cb671e839525bcd125c6bae61a81a050afa631b6c90438&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Nicholas Mata photographed with his mother Reasa Selph and father is Antonio Mata on Monday,..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Nicholas Mata photographed with his mother Reasa Selph and father is Antonio Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N.

He’s spent much of this summer at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the family recently learned that Nicholas’ heart isn’t functioning correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;And the family believes it all could’ve been prevented. As they juggle ongoing medical care, they’ve also set off on a quest for accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph filed a complaint with federal regulators, who then issued a violation notice to the hospital. The family also recently refiled a lawsuit against the Southlake hospital, naming the hospital itself, Dr. Teresa Proietti and the physicians group Emergency Medicine Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Proietti did not respond to phone calls to her office. In a succinct legal filing, the doctor denied the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;A spokesperson for the Methodist Health System said in an email that the system does not comment on pending litigation. A spokesperson for Emergency Medicine Consultants similarly declined to comment on active litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;At the end of July, however, Methodist Health System submitted legal filings to the court, saying the lawsuit’s assertions are vague and not sufficiently supported by the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the filing, the health system also wrote that it is not responsible for Proietti’s actions. The events of December 2023 were “wholly and completely unavoidable and without any negligence on the part of” the hospital, according to the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/DQ2PEVDVYZFGZBXDCJ7SY5PMPE.jpg?auth=8eb03109b74a45a2a2882374cdbd88cf63d82af2db9ae157351ab3cf9b9bbe94&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Reasa Selph holds hands with her son Nicholas Mata during an interview on Monday, July 14,..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Reasa Selph holds hands with her son Nicholas Mata during an interview on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The flurry of activity in the wake of Nicholas’ near-death experience is a testament to the amount of attention one family can garner, when they have the time and resources to dedicate. But they know not every family would be able to put the same energy and money into the cause — and, to Selph, that’s enough reason in itself to keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;The timeline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It started with what seemed to be a case of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In mid-December 2023, Nicholas was a fifth grader at Liberty Christian School in Argyle. The school sent him home sick, and Selph then took him to get medical care at Methodist Southlake. The hospital’s providers gave Nicholas an IV and sent him home to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For a while, it seemed like he was getting better. By the 22nd, though, Nicholas had gone downhill. By the 23rd, Selph and Mata could barely get Nicholas to move around, so they took him back to Methodist Southlake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We were there for a little under two hours,” Selph said, “and they just said, ‘Hey, it’s viral. Go home. He’ll be fine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;On Christmas morning, Nicholas was doing markedly worse, Selph said. He could barely get out of bed. He wouldn’t eat. And Selph distinctly remembers that her son looked gray and yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/MC5GP77YU5FJ3NPQGEYSXWIM7A.jpg?auth=7b2b78242485c164eb410319061fbee3d10665f88ece99f0c36ad9d56d1f1d90&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="Family photos of Nicholas Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Family photos of Nicholas Mata on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;This time, the family took Nicholas to Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth, where the medical providers swarmed the sick fifth grader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I had no idea until later how really, really sick he was,” Selph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;On that first day at Cook Children’s, Selph remembers Nicholas was throwing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“He starts to throw up and I grab the blue bag and I give him the blue bag and we’re holding it,” Selph said. “And he vomits a pint of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For Selph, it was one of the scariest moments of her son’s illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The Cook Children’s providers determined Nicholas was in septic shock. Septic shock is an extreme response to an infection, and it can worsen rapidly as the body’s organs shut down. The condition has a high mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“They came in and they just said, ‘We don’t know how this is going to turn out. We’d like to bring in a priest for you,’” Selph said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas had a weeklong stay in the ICU at Cook Children’s, punctuated by several invasive procedures including intubation. After the ICU, he spent another several weeks in the hospital before he was discharged. In total, he was hospitalized for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas survived, although Selph said there were long stretches where she thought he wouldn’t. Afterward, he had to relearn how to walk. And now, he has health complications that will likely be lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Importantly for Nicholas, some of the complications may also infringe on his ability to play football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=430 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/I6AZ4UAGTJCT5EGKJHB4MRXZVI.jpg?auth=3c08649f4e278d9b878c86c3caea2adf7a3b38c155d3bc62e3e9e8f2349214ba&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;width=830" alt="A Liberty Christian hat with an inspirational message to Nicholas Mata from Jason Witten is..."&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;A Liberty Christian hat with an inspirational message to Nicholas Mata from Jason Witten is displayed at Mata’s home on Monday, July 14, 2025, in Roanoke, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P secondaryRomanCaps secondaryRomanCaps-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family believes the worst of the illness and the complications could’ve been avoided if Methodist Southlake providers had taken better care of Nicholas on his second visit to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Pushing for accountability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In the months since Nicholas was discharged from the hospital, his family — and especially Selph — has searched for ways to hold Methodist Southlake and its providers responsible for what they see as medical malpractice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph filed a complaint with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates hospitals that accept Medicare and Medicaid, even if the patient in question has other forms of health care coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In mid-April 2024, according to a CMS document that Selph provided to &lt;i&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/i&gt;, the federal agency found that the Southlake hospital had failed to meet standards of care in Nicholas’ case. The document does not specifically name Nicholas, but it describes the unnamed patient as an 11-year-old and describes the same medical situation. Selph also said the document does refer to her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Specifically, the federal notice says Methodist Southlake failed to provide a proper medical screening and “discharged Patient #1 with a diagnosis of upper respiratory infection despite Patient #1 having abnormal labs, elevated heart rate and decreased blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family also filed a civil lawsuit against the hospital in September, but dropped it in favor of pushing for legislative action during Texas’ 2025 session. Now that the session is over, the family has refiled that Tarrant County lawsuit against Methodist Southlake and the treating doctor, Proietti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;They argue the hospital and the medical team were negligent in their treatment of Nicholas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While a spokesperson for Methodist declined to comment, attorneys for the health system wrote in legal filings that the family’s claims are not supported by the evidence and that the hospital is not responsible for Proietti’s actions. Proietti wrote in a short legal filing at the beginning of August that she denies the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph is also pushing for repercussions from the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Board of Nursing, and she’s looking into possible criminal charges, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;All of these paths take time. Selph said it’s been an enormous amount of work to file and follow up with the various enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Shane Langston, the family’s attorney, said the case is strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“I’ve been doing this a long time,” Langston said, “and we don’t file a case like this, against medical providers, unless it’s legitimate and strongly supported by our medical specialists who reviewed the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;‘There’s got to be change’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;There are moments of the past year and a half that are seared into their memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Selph remembers when they got home from the hospital, after Nicholas was discharged, and all of their Christmas decorations were up. It was, by then, well over a month since the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The whole family struggled with the strong association they had between Christmas — a favorite holiday — and Nicholas’ near death. Nicholas’ dad, Antonio Mata, said that when he thinks back on how sick his son was that day, he’s washed with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“How could I miss what he was trying to tell us?” Mata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;For their next Christmas, in 2024, Selph organized a wild departure from their usual rituals. They spent the day indoor skydiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“This past Christmas, we had a really tough time, because nobody wanted to be here,” Selph said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The family doesn’t want anyone else to experience what they have experienced: the panic, the weeks at the hospital, the guilt, the rearranging of their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We don’t want this to happen to someone else,” Selph said. “And if we can prevent just one person from going through this, that would be a win for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It could be months or years before their lawsuit is resolved, and the legal process can be both costly and time intensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“But it’s worth it,” Mata said. “There’s got to be change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 11:01:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxPSUFETk81Tjgyd2wwcVZXSHd4ZUZvTUJZVVNXODgwUnYxVDJ4MS1MY3JiQnJ3ejBHM0JMWnRlQjkwZmFaclFud2w1WThLSXJMWFNkZmc0VnhXRjVsSTZkV2ZiNEx5OEtybVlGNlN4NmRuSnFwUW5jYUFVclIyTlNKeXRQWTlIWmptc1Y3M1hJNV8tRV9HOGNIQ1ZrcEZULVZCNkNUM1BhZ2V3aFEtLWpyYW1SVDI0ZV9zT0M3VUJzZ01pek1mb3kzazVLT3JJcklKMmtaNVRFM29zdlp1Z1o5Nm9n</guid></item><item><title>睡不着？这5种瑜伽姿势比褪黑激素更快击倒我- CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOWUJNb3pXNHF4OWhGbEk2amlGRGlKT1ZlbXhwSU0tMFo5UlNQb29jXzhUUnFTUHAzMFVQZnFDMW1HajBUZm9XNFpGak5DWGk3OGoxNGxwNVdEVzhEdlFoQ3BZZjBxZ2hnTU5oOWFSMDZScVRlZGVMcnNqdkZsMHJCQkFaSTNPd2xoaEtxc0FjdmU4SEtwQ2VtNnNnS05hNmlwaGxz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Struggling to fall asleep even after upgrading your mattress, trying sleep aids, or turning on your favorite white noise? You're far from alone. According to a 2024 CNET survey, more than half of adults use some form of sleep support - yet restful nights still feel out of reach for many. While expensive gadgets and blackout curtains can help, one low-cost, effective option might already be right at your fingertips: yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;But here's the catch.

Yoga and breathing techniques help calm your nervous system and reduce cortisol, which puts your body in a more relaxed state, ideal to help you fall asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Calming the mind and body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Chloe Kernaghan, co-founder of yoga studio &lt;a href="https://www.skyting.com/" target="_self"&gt;Sky Ting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/start-a-home-yoga-practice-everything-you-need/" target="_self"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt; helps you sleep better in two ways: It helps relax a racing mind and calms the nervous system. "Yoga as a practice is centered around finding stillness in the mind, which more often than not is the opposite state the mind is in when we're having sleep issues (i.e., your mind is racing)," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga includes elements of mindfulness, but it's also a physical practice known for helping calm the body's physical stress response, or the nervous system, through breathwork and performing specific poses. Kernaghan explains, "The physical practice can help calm the nervous system and switch you from sympathetic mode to a parasympathetic mode, ideal for resting and deep sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reducing cortisol levels before bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research seems to agree with Kernaghan, as recent studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768222/" target="_self"&gt;engaging in yoga may lead to reduced levels of cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, the hormone associated with stress. The extent of cortisol reduction may vary depending on factors such as the frequency and intensity of yoga practice. Additionally, some studies have shown promising results regarding yoga's impact on depression symptoms. Yoga can complement traditional treatment approaches and promote overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean for your sleep? Well, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2021.694046/full#B1" target="_self"&gt;cortisol levels have a significant influence on sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;. Higher cortisol levels are often associated with difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. A &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393899/" target="_self"&gt;study conducted in 2019&lt;/a&gt; found that incorporating yoga into one's routine can positively affect insomnia symptoms. These findings suggest that practicing yoga may offer potential benefits for improving sleep quality and overall sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which types of yoga classes are best for sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all yoga classes are mellow. Some classes are more fast-paced, like power yoga for example, and can increase your heart rate. That's a good thing, but you want to focus on movement that does the opposite if you're feeling stressed and want to unwind before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I recommend doing calming, slow practices like yin yoga and restorative yoga," Kernaghan says. "In these classes, you'll generally stay in poses longer, use more props for support and have less intense instruction from the teacher, so there's more quiet space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the thought of doing anything that resembles a workout or requires a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-yoga-mat/" target="_self"&gt;yoga mat&lt;/a&gt; makes you cringe, you can also try yoga nidra, which Kernaghan recommends doing before bed. "Yoga nidra is "closer to meditation but is generally done lying down. Little to no physical effort is needed. Instead, a nidra practice helps drop you from a beta state (the waking state) to a theta state (occurs when you are dreaming, deeply relaxed or meditating)," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/landing1/best-mattress-sem-2024/" target="_self"&gt;Best Mattresses of 2025: Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed by our Sleep Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 best yoga poses for sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you struggle to fall asleep or catch quality Zs, try these poses in the evening to help you unwind. You can do them all in a sequence if you'd like, or pick and choose a few that feel good to you in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can definitely do poses on your own; sequences are nice because you have someone to guide you through, but if you're familiar with the postures, doing a few right before bed could be your perfect recipe," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supported Child's Pose&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Forward folds are calming for the body and with the fold at the knees and hips, this can also be a nice stretch for the hips and low back. definitely make sure your head is supported, so if you need to, add another pillow to make it comfortable," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it, according to Kernaghan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with your hands and knees touching the floor or bed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring your knees about as wide as a yoga mat, big toes touch behind you and sit your hips back to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a thick pillow or couch cushion lengthwise, placed between the legs for the torso to stretch forward on, which should act like gentle support from the low belly to the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel free to turn your neck to one side and breathe. Stay for three to five minutes, turning your head halfway through if your neck is turned.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supported Goddess Pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gentle hip-opener is a perfect way to unwind and relax. Having a deep fold in the legs can help with digestion, and letting the body settle heavy to the floor is a great way to release any lingering holds from your day," Kernaghan says. (The above video shows a related exercise, not the one described here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it, according to Kernaghan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Come to a seated position with your legs out in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring the soles of your feet together, with your knees butterflied open, and use two pillows (one under each thigh/knee) as support. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recline the torso back onto the floor; feel free to use a folded blanket underneath the back of the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place hands on the belly or open the arms out to the side. Cover the eyes if you'd like, and stay for three to five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Legs Up the Wall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This pose is amazing for so much, but in relation to sleep, it's great because it's a gentle inversion. The legs drain for a few minutes, which helps with circulation so the body is less agitated as you fall asleep. I love doing this pose in my bed sometimes, just swinging my legs up my headboard," Kernaghan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it, according to Kernaghan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This pose is just as it sounds. You sit close to a wall, bring your torso to the floor and swing your legs up the wall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I recommend bringing your seat close to the wall, but if the legs or lower back are tight, keep some bend in the knees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I like adding a pillow under my hips so my pelvis is slightly higher than my heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay for three to five minutes. If your legs feel tingly, you can always bend and butterfly your knees open with your feet together instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these three yoga poses for sleep in your nighttime tool kit, you will be on your way to sweet dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other yoga poses for sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These poses are for any level of experience and are easy enough for beginners. While moving between these poses, remember to pay attention to your breath and where you feel most tension in your body. Breathe and try to relax if you experience any discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/best-yoga-mat/" target="_self"&gt;Best Yoga Mats for 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Cat-cow pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get into this pose, start on your hands and knees. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart, and your knees should be below your hips. Take a deep breath and tilt your head toward the ceiling while also sticking up your pelvis, which should mimic a "cow." Then, on your exhale, arch your back and bring both your head and pelvis down like a "cat." You can repeat these two motions a few times before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Forward fold&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pose is as easy as standing up straight and leaning over to reach for your toes. If you are able, place your hands on the ground. If you are unable to touch your toes, you can do a half-forward fold and grab below your knees. Looking for a challenge? Try reaching around your ankles and holding on. Make sure your back is straight and you are taking deep breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Bridge pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by lying down on your back, legs and arms stretched out and on the ground. Take a deep breath, raise your core off the ground and shift your arms closer to your body to balance. Your knees should be at a 90-degree angle. Your hands can lie flat, or you can bring them together underneath your core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Happy baby&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an easy pose to transition into after Bridge, since you start this pose on your back. Lift your legs to the ceiling and out a little past your shoulders (or however far you can go). Then, grab onto the outside of your feet with both hands. Gently rock left and right to relieve tension in your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Seated twist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recommend trying this after coming out of Child's pose. Simply sit back up and extend your legs out in front of you. Cross one leg over the other, pulling the heel of the crossed leg to your outer thigh. With the opposite arm, cross your body and twist yourself, pushing with your elbow on the raised knee. Twist and breathe. Repeat with the other side before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Butterfly pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a seated position, straighten your posture and press the bottom of both your feet together. Placing your hands on your feet, attempt to press your hips as low as you can to the ground. The lower you go, the bigger the stretch. If you are looking for more of a challenge, move your feet closer to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Head-to-knee pose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a basic pose. Start in a seated position with your legs out in front of you. Bring one foot to the inner thigh of your opposite leg and extend your hands out over your extended leg. Sit up taller, breathe deeply and grab ahold of your foot in front of you. If you can't fully reach your foot, no problem: Grab your ankle or the back of your knee. Lean into the stretch and try to bring your forehead to your knee. Repeat on the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still want more?

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a team of international researchers published a &lt;a href="https://journals.iucr.org/m/issues/2016/04/00/jt5013/jt5013fig1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;structural biology study in &lt;em&gt;IUCrJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that decoded the &lt;strong&gt;atomic-level makeup&lt;/strong&gt; of protein crystals secreted by a little-known&lt;strong&gt; cockroach &lt;/strong&gt;species, &lt;em&gt;Diploptera punctata&lt;/em&gt;. These crystals—formed inside developing embryos—are so nutritionally dense that scientists have suggested they could one day serve as &lt;strong&gt;a potent compact food source&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Backed by molecular imaging, the study revealed that the crystals are complete, highly ordered structures made of &lt;strong&gt;proteins, sugars, and lipids&lt;/strong&gt;, and that they could offer &lt;strong&gt;more than three times the energy of buffalo milk&lt;/strong&gt; per gram. While this doesn’t mean we’ll be sipping on cockroach milkshakes anytime soon, the implications for food science, space travel, and survival nutrition are significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Unique Cockroach and an Unusual Form of Nourishment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diploptera punctata&lt;/em&gt;, a cockroach native to Pacific regions, is one of the few insect species that &lt;strong&gt;gives birth to live young&lt;/strong&gt; rather than laying eggs. To support &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/70-million-year-old-dinosaur-embryo-discovered/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79654" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;embryo development&lt;/a&gt;, the mother produces a &lt;strong&gt;milk-like fluid&lt;/strong&gt; that crystallizes in the gut of her offspring. Each of these &lt;strong&gt;Lili-Mip protein crystals&lt;/strong&gt; contains all the essential &lt;strong&gt;amino acids&lt;/strong&gt;, along with fats and carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crystals were imaged using &lt;strong&gt;X-ray diffraction&lt;/strong&gt;, which revealed a &lt;strong&gt;lipocalin fold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bound lipids&lt;/strong&gt;, and a tightly packed glycosylated structure that allows for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/longevity-to-live-117-years-eating-only-three-yogurts-a-day-research-confirms/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86084" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow digestion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—a rare property among natural proteins. As co-author &lt;em&gt;Sanchari Banerjee&lt;/em&gt; noted, the crystals are &lt;strong&gt;“a complete food,”&lt;/strong&gt; offering not only macronutrients but also time-release nutritional delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Built for Slow Release and High Efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many nutrient supplements that spike and fade quickly in the bloodstream, the cockroach milk crystals &lt;strong&gt;dissolve gradually&lt;/strong&gt;, offering a &lt;strong&gt;sustained release of energy&lt;/strong&gt;. This controlled release is a direct consequence of their molecular structure, which holds nutrients in tightly packed layers, releasing them only as enzymes slowly break the crystal down during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to lead researcher &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subramanian Ramaswamy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the protein “is time-released food. If you need calorically high food, that is time released and complete—this is it.” This characteristic could make it especially useful in scenarios requiring &lt;strong&gt;compact, long-lasting nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;—such as in emergency rations, long-duration missions in space, or extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;

Polarized microscopy reveals birefringent protein crystals enclosed inside the embryo midgut and an enlarged view of the extracted crystals (inset). Credit: Journal IUCrJ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;No Milking Machines—Just Molecular Biology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the catchy headlines, &lt;strong&gt;milking cockroaches is neither feasible nor efficient&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, it would take over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 cockroaches to produce just 100 grams&lt;/strong&gt; of the crystals. Instead, the researchers identified and sequenced the &lt;strong&gt;genes responsible for producing the Lili-Mip proteins&lt;/strong&gt;, and are now attempting to &lt;strong&gt;replicate them in microbial systems like yeast&lt;/strong&gt;. This would allow the proteins to be produced in large quantities without relying on the insects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, this could pave the way for a novel category of engineered superfoods, offering compact, customizable, and shelf-stable nutrition for specific needs. The biomanufacturing pathway would also enable &lt;strong&gt;precise control over composition&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing future versions to be optimized for different demographic or medical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Future Use Cases—But Not Your Next Protein Shake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its nutritional value, cockroach milk is &lt;strong&gt;not suitable for general consumption&lt;/strong&gt;—at least not yet. For one, &lt;strong&gt;no clinical trials have tested its safety in humans&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s also the caloric density: a hypothetical 250 ml serving of cockroach milk would pack around &lt;strong&gt;700 kilocalories&lt;/strong&gt;, making it a poor fit for calorie-conscious Western diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where it may shine, however, is in &lt;strong&gt;specialty applications&lt;/strong&gt;: nutritional therapy for malnourished populations, &lt;strong&gt;space food&lt;/strong&gt; for astronauts, or &lt;strong&gt;emergency packs&lt;/strong&gt; where space and stability matter more than flavor. The crystals are &lt;strong&gt;highly stable&lt;/strong&gt;, do not require refrigeration, and contain a nearly perfect nutrient profile—qualities hard to match with conventional food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for those wondering about taste? According to a few researchers who handled the crystals, they are reported to have &lt;strong&gt;no discernible flavor&lt;/strong&gt;—a small relief in an otherwise alien-sounding food source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That's a new case diagnosed roughly every 3.2 seconds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the personal devastation that this diagnosis causes for affected individuals and their loved ones, ADI estimates that the global cost of dementia will rise to $2.8 trillion by 2030, a number that includes the cost of informal care by family and friends as well as direct medical costs. In the face of this daunting trajectory, one new study offers a glimmer of hope by suggesting that following an AI-designed diet may significantly lower one's risk of developing dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In early July, researchers from Shanghai, China, published the findings of their study on a machine learning optimized diet against dementia risk in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02255-w" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The studied aimed to identify dietary patterns that may delay the onset of dementia or slow structural and pathological changes in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team explains that while there has been work done in this field, "existing observational studies are often hampered by relatively small sample sizes, short-term follow-up, or both, especially considering the long preclinical phase of dementia." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To fill these research gaps, the scientists used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, which collected 24-hour dietary information from 185,012 participants and followed up with them after an average of 10 years to review who developed any type of dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They then undertook a "food-wide association analysis and identified food groups associated with incident dementia" out of this massive cohort. Based on this data, the researchers "ranked the importance of food groups in predicting dementia risk with a machine-learning approach and derived a new dietary pattern for dementia prevention." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, they compared the magnitude of this new dietary pattern's association with dementia to that of the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/mind-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known diet that was developed in 2015 to promote healthy brain aging. In short, they investigated which one was likely more effective at preventing the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Results revealed that a number of foods we already know to be nutritious are also linked to reduced risk of dementia. These ingredients include green leafy vegetables, citrus, and berries. Consuming grapefruit was found to be associated with a lower risk of dementia compared to not eating grapefruit at all, and similar results were revealed for sweet peppers and tomatoes. Moderate intake of potatoes, eggs, olive oil, and poultry was recommended as well, with the study providing guidelines for how much of each one should eat per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the opposite end of the spectrum, the machine-learning model and researchers found that some foods could increase the risk of dementia, such as sweetened beverages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Following the revelation of connections between some foods and risk of dementia, the study created a suggested dietary pattern consisting of seven components, dubbed the "Machine learning-assisted Optimizing Dietary intERvention against demeNtia risk," or MODERN diet, built around three categories: adequacy, moderation, and restriction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods were then placed into a fitting category, which points to how much of that item one should be consuming. For example, olive oil was placed in the adequacy group, indicating that greater intake of it could reduce the risk of dementia. For the foods in the moderation category, the team suggested that people should aim to have neither too little nor too much of these ingredients, like leafy greens, berries, citrus, potatoes, eggs, and poultry. Unsurprisingly, the team put sweetened beverages in its "restriction" category, noting that people should not consume them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The MODERN diet aligns with the MIND diet on many important guidelines while providing some key updates to this recommended way of eating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "While green leafy vegetables and poultry were recommended for higher intake in the MIND diet, the MODERN diet recommended moderate intake," the team wrote in its discussion. "The MODERN diet also recommends moderate intake of fruits and added citrus fruits to berries in fruit choices, both of which are rich in plant polyphenols and may improve cognitive function by inhibiting oxidative stress in the brain and neurodegenerative pathologies." Citrus had not previously been recommended in the MIND diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A crucial clarification here is the word "moderate," as the researchers added that "extremely high intakes of these components potentially increased the risk of incident dementia… suggesting that a ‘balanced’ diet derived from hierarchical clustering was related to better cognitive functions." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One component of the older MIND diet was missing from this new research's suggested dietary pattern: fish. The authors explained that fish didn't appear to increase or decrease the risk of dementia in the cohort they studied. However, they pointed out that this could be because the cohort was made up of British people, and fish is "often fried in the United Kingdom," which may have impacted the results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Variables like this are why the team concluded that "future studies are warranted to validate this dietary pattern in diverse populations and evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in clinical and public health practice." But if continued research supports these findings, it could mean that the MODERN diet is even more effective than its predecessor at reducing the risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small trial across ten U.S. research sites, a novel HIV vaccine candidate has shown a result that has eluded scientists for four decades: it reliably produced potent, virus-blocking antibodies in most participants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work, published last week in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ady6831"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, tested three experimental vaccines built with the same mRNA technology used in COVID-19 shots but with a crucial twist. Instead of encoding HIV’s outer protein in its free-floating form, two of the vaccines instructed cells to make a “membrane-anchored” version, mimicking how the protein appears on the actual virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That one subtle change made a striking difference. After three doses, 80% of volunteers who received a membrane-bound version produced “tier 2” neutralizing antibodies. This is a benchmark that suggests good protection against the virus. Meanwhile, in the group that received the traditional soluble form, only 4% did.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The difference is pretty striking,” Sharon Lewin, head of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, who was not involved in the research, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02439-4"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “These are the first studies, so they’re very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-is-an-hiv-vaccine-so-hard-to-make"&gt;Why is an HIV vaccine so hard to make&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1983, HIV has proven uniquely slippery. The virus wears a dense coat of sugars, shielding key targets from antibodies, and mutates so rapidly that even an &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/measles-doesnt-just-make-you-sick-it-resets-your-immune-system/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2558"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; that manages to block one strain is often powerless against the next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, most vaccine candidates have targeted the “envelope trimer”—a three-pronged protein that HIV uses to latch onto immune cells. In reality, much of the trimer’s base is hidden against the viral membrane. Soluble protein vaccines, however, expose that base. This, in turn, prompts the body to make antibodies that bind there. But these antibodies can’t stop the actual infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach, developed by William Schief and colleagues at Scripps Research and Moderna, anchors the protein to cell membranes. That way, the immune system learns to recognize more vulnerable, real-world parts of the virus and can effectively eliminate the virus&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 100 HIV vaccine trials have been undertaken over the years. But this one seemed particularly promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/animal-cruelty-free-testing-methods-will-tested-u-s-food-drug-administration/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2560"&gt;Animal tests&lt;/a&gt; hinted that such vaccines might work better. The new trial, involving humans, confirmed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-the-trial-found"&gt;What the Trial Found&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 108 healthy adults aged 18 to 55. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three vaccines: the soluble trimer, a membrane-bound trimer, or a membrane-bound version with a mutation to block CD4 receptor binding. Each group received either a low (100 μg) or high (250 μg) dose, three times over six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tests on volunteers’ blood showed that the membrane-bound vaccines spurred a stronger immune reaction than the traditional approach. They also seemed to “train” the immune system to focus less on parts of the virus that don’t help much in stopping infection, and more on its weak spots—regions known as V1/V3 and C3/V5—that are more likely to block HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vaccines also built up a stockpile of memory B cells, which act like long-term sentries, and activated specialized T cells, which help coordinate the body’s entire immune defense. The entire body’s immune system mobilized for the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there were limits. The antibodies produced were “autologous.” They recognized the particular virus strain the vaccine had, but not the many other HIV strains circulating worldwide. The ultimate goal is to elicit &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/vaccine-hiv-passes-phase-one-trial-23637533/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2557"&gt;broadly neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; (bnAbs), which can target conserved sites across diverse strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1024x680.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-750x498.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1140x757.jpg 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color.webp 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1024x680.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-750x498.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color-1140x757.jpg 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/HIV-budding-Color.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-288130 sp-no-webp" alt="Scanning electron micrograph of HIV-1 budding (in green) from cultured lymphocyte" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Scanning electron micrograph of HIV-1 budding (in green) from a cultured lymphocyte. Credit: Wikimedia Commons&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The side effects were significant, but not truly threatening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven participants — about 6.5 percent — developed hives, or urticaria, after vaccination. In five cases, the condition became chronic, lasting more than six weeks; in some, symptoms persisted for years. The reaction occurred across all three vaccine types, at both doses, and has not been seen in &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/finally-mrna-vaccines-against-cancer-are-starting-to-become-a-reality/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2559"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; against other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a scientific mystery at the moment,” Schief told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2490444-human-trials-point-the-way-towards-an-mrna-vaccine-against-hiv/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers suspect that something about the combination of HIV proteins and the mRNA delivery platform triggers the effect, but they have yet to pinpoint the cause. Future trials will test lower doses in hopes of reducing the risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-we-actually-make-an-hiv-vaccine"&gt;Can we actually make an HIV vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite all the unknown variables, the study is a milestone. Only two other mRNA HIV vaccine trials have ever reached human testing, and none until now have shown such a high rate of neutralizing antibody production. It’s truly promising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say the technology’s speed and flexibility brought by mRNA (which allows new designs built in just months) can accelerate the long, trial-and-error process of training the immune system to fight HIV. In the future, scientists could program a single mRNA shot to release a full sequence of priming and boosting proteins in timed waves, replacing months or even years of repeated clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it’s far from a solved problem. First, studies with a greater sample size need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Then, researchers need to find a way to make the vaccine effective against multiple strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a worthy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the best current HIV prevention tools, such as the twice-yearly injectable drug lenacapavir, require ongoing use and access to healthcare. A durable, widely protective vaccine would be transformative, especially in low-resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;

Good news if you’re not someone who has been able to reach that goal easily — a new &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt; medical journal says just 7,000 steps a day might be enough to cause noticeable improvements in health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by researchers from Australia, Spain and the UK, reviewed past papers for correlation between levels of exercise and risk factors of various ailments such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, depressive symptoms and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a baseline of 2,000 steps, which is something most adults manage even without taking extra time to exercise, the study compared the reduction in rates of disease incidence. The findings indicate that those who walk 7,000 steps are 47 per cent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and 37pc less likely to die of cancer. The same group has a 25pc lesser chance of developing cardiovascular disease in the first place and a 14pc lower risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to this, those who completed their 10,000 steps were only marginally less likely to develop these diseases, the differences being in single digits. The study even found that the more active group was very slightly more prone to dying from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mental health front, the study found those who exercise had a 38pc lower chance of exhibiting depressive symptoms and a 22pc less chance of developing dementia. They also found that the 7,000-step group had better balance and coordination, being 28pc less likely to suffer falls; this number went down for those walking over 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 2019 &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2734709#google_vignette"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Japanese and US researchers found a similar peak benefit point at 7,500 steps; the same paper said walking backwards was more beneficial for cognitive ability and coordination. A 2011 &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link--external" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289267640_Backward_walking_A_possible_active_exercise_for_low_back_pain_reduction_and_enhanced_function_in_athletes"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Nevada backed up the correlation between brain health and backward retro walking; it also said walking backwards strengthens hamstrings and reduces pain in the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;

The prolonged consequences sound very painful," one user wrote on Chinese social media platform Weibo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The US has urged travellers to China to exercise "increased caution" following the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af73/live/88f039f0-71cb-11f0-bb15-e58cf64b3661.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Four workers inspecting a neighbourhood in Foshan amid a sharp rise in chikungunya fever cases " class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The best way to prevent the virus from spreading is to reduce pools of stagnant water that allow the mosquitoes to breed, says the World Health Organization&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;What else is China doing to curb infections?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Authorities across Guangdong province have vowed to take "decisive and forceful measures" to stop the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those with symptoms, such as fever, joint pain or rashes, are being urged to visit the nearest hospital so they can be tested for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Authorities have instructed residents to remove stagnant water in their homes, such as in flowerpots, coffee machines or spare bottles - and warned of fines up to   10,000 yuan ($1,400) if they don't do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are also releasing giant "elephant mosquitoes" that can devour smaller, chikungunya-spreading bugs; and an army of mosquito-eating fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Last week, officials in Foshan released 5,000 of these larvae-eating fish into the city's lakes. In parts of the city, they are even flying drones to detect sources of stagnant water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some neighbouring cities had ordered travellers from Foshan to undergo a 14-day home quarantine, but that has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some people have compared these measures to those imposed during the pandemic, and questioned their necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A user on Weibo wrote, "These feel so familiar... But are they really necessary?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another wrote: "What's the point of the quarantine? It's not as though an infected patient will then go around biting other people?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;China implemented severe restrictions during the pandemic, including forcing people into quarantine camps and sealing residential buildings and whole neighbourhoods on short notice for days or even weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;What is chikungunya?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most people bitten by an infected mosquito will develop symptoms of chikungunya within three to seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Apart from fever and joint pain, other symptoms include rash, headache, muscle pain and swollen joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In severe cases however, the joint pain can last for months or even years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those at risk for more severe disease include newborns, the elderly, and people with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is no cure, but deaths from chikungunya are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The virus was first identified in Tanzania in 1952. It then spread to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To date, it has been reported in more than 110 countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The best way to prevent the virus from spreading is to reduce pools of stagnant water that allow the mosquitoes to breed, according to the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 07:18:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBLNmpFTVA4a183SkNnSUlmZFJyaUdMemwtdGZOcVk3RHFYTHlkM2VwcTNTR1ZuN1RWU3NWMXZ4cDVlT3dGSzMxUEF0cGJ2bmgzd1NVVHhMQV93UdIBX0FVX3lxTE52U0ZRVTdVd05BNGtRZDI1ZHAtZEYydzgxSUpQMmRSRF84cXU4ZnVpYW9NVDZLdjZwNEMzbTFzSzBpVGpXU2Z0b2oxMkNDdUlQeVl3NGY5S0ZNNExFUlZJ</guid></item><item><title>“僵尸”细胞让科学家重新思考我们如何衰老—以及如何应对：短波- NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9RNnRESUhZNzR6VFlzMnhuSGlubGJKa1dqSWdGNkxFbE5NSk5rX3l2VWljaWhqWUtCYnBlckhLYzFDaWZ4eWNMUGFLbjZqckpsTXUwS3ZTVTd3cVFZVzY1OG9wbTdzTHlKZkFuaWVMdWdjcFEyU3VOZTJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;It's no secret that stress isn't good for you. But just how bad is it? Well, in the last few decades, scientists have linked psychological stress to changes in our DNA that look a lot like what happens on the molecular level as we age. Today on the show, host &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/1082526815/regina-g-barber" target="_blank"&gt;Regina G. Barber&lt;/a&gt; talks to freelance science journalist &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01886-3" target="_blank"&gt;Diana Kwon&lt;/a&gt; about the latest research on stress and aging, including a new hypothesis for how your brain handles aging — and what science could do about all of it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Diana's full piece &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01886-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more aging science?

&lt;p&gt;Strength, mobility and flexibility are three attributes that typically fade as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But act now, and you can slow this biological aging process in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? According to experienced Pilates teacher Brett Starkowitz it’s by lifting weights to build muscle and regularly mobilizing your body to stay limber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the head of education and master trainer at London’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ten.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ten.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ten Health &amp;amp; Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, Starkowitz is a vocal advocate of incorporating Pilates into your weekly workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s such a good complementary form of exercise to anything else you’re doing,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re weightlifting, it’ll make your weightlifting better. If you’re running, it’ll make your running better. It’ll make everyday activities better, because you’re learning to use your body better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you can’t get to a Pilates studio and Reformer Pilates isn’t an option, Starkowitz has a four-move solution that he uses daily to keep his mobility and flexibility topped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to keep introducing mobility drills into your day,” he says. “I’ve always done weightlifting and weight-bearing exercise, but I’ve started spending a lot more time on mobility, because you lose that as you get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hZHby6FSBRCjmC7bsZ936W" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hZHby6FSBRCjmC7bsZ936W slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 43-year-old says he refined this routine in his 30s, “because when you’re in your 20s you can just jump into the gym and go, but not so much anymore.” He now uses it after every workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need is your bodyweight to get started. You can perform it after your workouts, like Starkowitz does, or as a standalone mobility routine whenever you need to loosen up your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-boost-your-mobility-with-these-four-pilates-inspired-exercises"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Boost your mobility with these four Pilates-inspired exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starkowitz’s routine involves four Pilates-inspired stretches that will help unlock the most common pain points: the spine, the hips, the back of the legs, and the chest and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with a cat-cow stretch to gently articulate each vertebrae of the spine, then moves onto a deep hip flexor stretch, a downward-facing dog to lengthen the back body and child’s pose to release the lats and traps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you get older you need to be mindful of dedicating a bit more time to warming up and mobility work and stretching,” he says. So take your time, enjoy each stretch and your future self will thank you later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-cat-cow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1 Cat-cow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ieDjs4PG74Agcvy6BUmfCa/GettyImages-1351466718.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ieDjs4PG74Agcvy6BUmfCa/GettyImages-1351466718.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / tapui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin on your hands and knees with your shoulders over your wrists and your hips over your knees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale as you arch your back, lifting your head and tailbone (this is cow pose).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale as you round your spine, tucking your chin into your chest and your tailbone under (this is cat pose).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move slowly between the two poses, syncing your breath with each movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform 8-10 slow cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-hip-flexor-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2 Hip flexor lunge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7d95X2UUbUWhSQgzUbBJT/hip-flexor-stretch-GettyImages-2139314022.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7d95X2UUbUWhSQgzUbBJT/hip-flexor-stretch-GettyImages-2139314022.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / DragonImages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From kneeling, step one leg forward into the top of a lunge position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuck your tailbone under slightly and lightly engage your glutes to protect your lower back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your hands on your hips, gently ease your body forward to deepen the stretch into the hip flexor and quads on the rear leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform two sets of 20-30 seconds per side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-downward-dog"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3 Downward dog &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGSL78ku3uGft3uC9Ti3Bn/GettyImages-1483867092.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGSL78ku3uGft3uC9Ti3Bn/GettyImages-1483867092.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / PeopleImages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on all fours, tuck your toes, and lift your hips up and back to form an inverted V-shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your spine long and legs as straight as comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spread your fingers wide and press your heels toward the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Option to pedal your feet, gently pressing one heel then the other toward the floor to loosen your calves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 30 seconds, returning your knees to the floor between each set.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-child-s-pose"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4 Child’s pose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="looped-video"&gt;&lt;video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6VDRxive6ygRaKZWb26xB/childs-pose-GettyImages-1483933220.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6VDRxive6ygRaKZWb26xB/childs-pose-GettyImages-1483933220.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video credit: Getty Images / PeopleImages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on all fours with your knees wide and feet close together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit back onto your feet as far as you comfortably can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your chin tucked into your chest, reach your hands forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Option to raise your hands so only your fingertips are in contact with the floor and press your chest further into the floor to stretch your pecs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, shuffle your hands to one side to stretch the side of your back, then over to the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for two sets of 30 seconds, or one set of 30 seconds each side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;I was three weeks into my plant-based journey, feeling virtuous about the mountain of hummus I'd just demolished at a friend's dinner party, when it happened. The kind of intestinal rebellion that makes you question every life choice that led to this moment. My friend Sarah, a veteran vegan of eight years, caught my panicked expression across the room and simply mouthed: "Beans?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, I learned I wasn't alone in what the internet delicately calls "protein farts"—though when you're plant-based, it might be more accurate to call them "fiber farts" or, as my gastroenterologist friend likes to say, "your microbiome throwing a welcome party for all that new plant matter."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon is so common among new plant-based eaters that there's an entire underground network of Reddit threads, Instagram DMs, and whispered gym conversations about it. Yet somehow, nobody warned me that my body might stage a minor revolution when I swapped chicken breast for chickpeas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your gut bacteria are having a moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's actually happening in your digestive system isn't quite the same as what happens to the bro-science crowd downing whey protein shakes. When omnivores talk about protein farts, they're usually describing what happens when excess animal protein reaches the large intestine undigested, where bacteria ferment it into sulfur compounds. Hence the notorious gym locker room aroma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But plant-based protein comes wrapped in a package deal with fiber, resistant starches, and specific carbohydrates called oligosaccharides. Your gut bacteria absolutely love these compounds—perhaps a little too enthusiastically at first. Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, gastroenterologist and author of &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;"Fiber Fueled,"&lt;/a&gt; explains it like this: "You're not just feeding yourself; you're feeding an entire ecosystem of microbes who've been on a standard American diet for years. Suddenly, it's Christmas morning."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 study in the journal Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; found that when people dramatically increase their fiber intake, the gut microbiome can shift significantly within just 24 hours. The gas? That's actually your beneficial bacteria multiplying and producing short-chain fatty acids—compounds linked to everything from reduced inflammation to better mental health. Your body is literally building a better digestive system—it's just being really loud about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing nobody tells you is that this gassy phase is actually a sign that something good is happening. Research from the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Human Microbiome Project&lt;/a&gt; shows that increased gas production in the first few weeks of a high-fiber diet correlates with positive changes in gut microbiome diversity. The more diverse your gut bacteria, the better your overall health tends to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The legume learning curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started keeping what I called my "bean diary" (don't judge), tracking which plant proteins caused the most drama. Chickpeas were surprisingly gentle. Black beans required strategic timing. Lentils and I needed couples therapy. But the real plot twist? After about six weeks, my body started to chill out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adaptation period varies wildly between people. Some lucky souls sail through without a single uncomfortable moment. Others, like my friend Marcus who went plant-based for athletic performance, spent two months planning social events around his digestive schedule. "I literally had to map out which beans I could eat before teaching cycling classes," he told me. "Split peas before spin class? Absolutely not."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science backs up our anecdotal experiences. A study from Arizona State University found that while 50% of participants reported increased gas during the first week of adding beans to their diet, by week two, that number dropped to 11%. By week three, most people's digestive systems had adapted completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what fascinated me: different legumes affect people differently, and there's actually a hierarchy of digestibility. Red lentils, being hulled and split, are generally the gentlest entry point. Mung beans and adzuki beans, staples in Asian cuisines, contain fewer oligosaccharides than their Western counterparts. Black beans and kidney beans, with their higher oligosaccharide content, tend to be the most challenging for newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The cultural wisdom we've been ignoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What struck me during my research was how many traditional cultures have been eating legumes for millennia without walking around in a constant state of digestive distress. Turns out, they knew some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In India, where lentils appear in nearly every meal, they're almost always cooked with digestive spices like cumin, coriander, and asafoetida (hing). These aren't just flavor additions—they contain compounds that help break down complex carbohydrates and reduce gas formation. Mexican cuisine pairs beans with epazote, a herb that's been used for centuries specifically to reduce the gassiness of beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese have a practice of adding a small piece of kombu seaweed to their bean dishes. When I tried this with my notorious black beans, the difference was noticeable. The seaweed contains enzymes that help break down oligosaccharides before they reach your gut bacteria. It's like pre-digesting your food, but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the simple act of soaking beans overnight—something our grandmothers did automatically—removes about 25% of the oligosaccharides. When you discard that soaking water, you're literally pouring away a portion of the compounds that cause gas. Add a pinch of baking soda to the soaking water, and you can increase that number to nearly 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When your body is sending different signals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where I need to channel my inner responsible adult: while most gas is normal and temporary, sometimes your body is trying to tell you something more serious. If you're experiencing severe bloating, pain, or digestive issues that don't improve after 6-8 weeks, it might not just be adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people discover underlying issues when they go plant-based—not because plants caused them, but because the dietary change revealed them. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), IBS, or food intolerances can all masquerade as "normal" plant-based adjustment issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way when my "normal" adjustment stretched into month three. Turns out, I have a fructan intolerance that has nothing to do with being plant-based but everything to do with why certain beans and I will never be friends. A registered dietitian who specializes in plant-based nutrition helped me figure out my personal triggers and work around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key warning signs that something more might be going on: pain (not just discomfort), bloating that doesn't resolve between meals, changes in bowel habits that persist beyond the adjustment period, or any symptoms that interfere with your daily life. These deserve professional attention, not just more digestive enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The surprisingly simple solutions that actually work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After polling my plant-based community and diving into research, I've discovered that the solutions are less about eliminating foods and more about strategic preparation and timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradual approach works wonders. My nutritionist suggested I think of it like training for a marathon—you don't go from couch to 26 miles overnight. Start with a tablespoon of hummus, not the whole container. Add a quarter cup of lentils to your soup before making lentil soup the main event. One study found that people who increased their legume intake by just 1/4 cup per week had significantly fewer digestive symptoms than those who jumped in with both feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timing matters too. Eating legumes earlier in the day gives your body more time to process them. Having beans at lunch rather than dinner can make evening social events much more comfortable. And contrary to popular belief, drinking water with your beans actually helps—the fluid helps move things along rather than letting them sit and ferment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enzyme question comes up constantly in plant-based circles. While digestive enzymes containing alpha-galactosidase (the enzyme that breaks down oligosaccharides) can help, they're not a permanent solution for most people. Think of them as training wheels while your gut bacteria adapt. I kept them in my bag for the first two months, used them less and less, and now they gather dust in my medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The unexpected social dynamics of plant-based digestion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody prepared me for the social aspect of digestive adjustment. There's something uniquely vulnerable about being the person who brought the lentil salad to the potluck and then having to strategically position yourself near open windows. The plant-based community, however, tends to handle this with remarkable humor and solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Probiotics are your friend," texted my yoga teacher when I confessed why I'd been avoiding inversions. My CrossFit buddy shared his "emergency enzyme" stash. Even my decidedly non-vegan brother started stocking oat milk because he noticed I was avoiding family dinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most was how open the athletic plant-based community is about this topic. At a vegan runners' meetup, the conversation turned to pre-race fueling strategies that wouldn't cause mid-run disasters. These elite athletes had spreadsheets tracking which plant proteins worked best for their training schedules. If Olympic athletes can figure it out, so can we mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The performance question nobody wants to ask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's address the elephant in the room: does the digestive adjustment period affect athletic performance? For the first month, honestly, yes. I noticed my running times suffered slightly, not from lack of energy but from discomfort and the mental distraction of worrying about my gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what the long-term data shows: plant-based athletes often report better recovery times, reduced inflammation, and improved endurance once their bodies adapt. The key is getting through the adjustment period without giving up. My running buddy, who's been plant-based for five years, reminded me that he went through the same thing. "Now I can eat a bean burrito an hour before a run," he said. "Try that with a steak."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amino acid profile of plant proteins is different from animal proteins, but your body is remarkably good at assembling complete proteins from various plant sources throughout the day. You don't need to worry about combining proteins at every meal—just eat a variety of plant foods and your body will handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What three months taught me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months into my plant-based journey, I can eat a bowl of three-bean chili without planning an exit strategy. My energy levels have stabilized at a height I didn't know was possible. And yes, my gym performance has improved—though I'll admit the first month was rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein fart phenomenon, embarrassing as it is, taught me something valuable about transformation: sometimes the most uncomfortable phases are signs that profound change is happening. Your body isn't betraying you when it protests dietary changes; it's adapting, rebuilding, restructuring its entire digestive ecosystem to work with your new choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that once your body adjusts, you often end up with better digestion than you had as an omnivore. Many of us report feeling less bloated, more regular, and generally more comfortable in our bodies. We just don't talk about it as much as we joke about the adjustment period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I have appreciated a heads-up about the gassy adjustment period? Absolutely. But would I go back to my pre-plant-based diet to avoid a few weeks of digestive drama? Not a chance. Because here's what they don't tell you about protein farts: they're temporary. The benefits of plant-based eating—for your health, the planet, and the animals—are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with a black bean burger. And yes, I can eat it without fear. That's what I call progress.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The speed of your steps could make a significant difference in adding years to your life, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from Vanderbilt University in the US analyzed the physical activity of 79,856 adults in 12 US states, comparing links between time spent walking slowly, time spent walking quickly, and eventual &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/leading-cause-of-death-in-us-claims-a-life-every-34-seconds"&gt;cause of death&lt;/a&gt; (where applicable) across an average follow-up period of almost 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data showed that those people who spent at least a quarter of an hour each day walking briskly were significantly less likely to die during the study period, especially from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/big-city-lights-could-be-damaging-your-heart-health"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the findings particularly useful is they're based on a sample that includes people typically underrepresented in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-walking-style-can-have-surprising-health-benefits-study-says"&gt;walking studies like this&lt;/a&gt;: the cohort was predominantly made up of low-income and Black individuals, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-017-0469-5"&gt;who are often&lt;/a&gt; more likely to live in impoverished areas and less likely to have access to safe walking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supercharge-your-daily-walk-with-these-5-simple-changes"&gt;Supercharge Your Daily Walk With These 5 Simple Changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research has shown that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day was associated with a nearly 20 percent reduction in total mortality, while a smaller reduction in mortality was found in association with more than three hours of daily slow walking," &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/pick-up-the-pace-of-your-daily-walk-to-boost-longevity-experts-say"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Wei Zheng, from Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This benefit remained strong even after accounting for other lifestyle factors and was consistent across various sensitivity analyses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169611" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169611" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WalkingRisk.jpg" alt="Walking and cardiovascular disease risk" class="wp-image-169611 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WalkingRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WalkingRisk-600x340.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169611" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Slow walking and fast walking, with associated risk of death from cardiovascular disease. (Liu et al., &lt;em&gt;Am. J. Prev.

To qualify for the faster walking linked to the reduction in the risk of death, it had to be something like climbing stairs or walking briskly as part of an exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study isn't comprehensive enough to show direct cause and effect, the drop in mortality risk is significant enough to strongly suggest some kind of link, and the researchers think the benefits that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise"&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; brings to heart health is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking makes the heart work harder, improving cardiovascular health. Burning calories can also help people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/to-tackle-our-obesity-crisis-experts-say-everything-we-do-must-change"&gt;stick to a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the health benefits of daily walking are well established, limited research has investigated the effects of factors such as walking pace on mortality, particularly in low-income and Black/African-American populations," &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/pick-up-the-pace-of-your-daily-walk-to-boost-longevity-experts-say"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zheng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supercharge-your-daily-walk-with-these-5-simple-changes"&gt;researchers are so keen&lt;/a&gt; to promote walking as a way of staying healthy is that it's just about the simplest exercise out there: most of us can do it, without any special equipment, and it's relatively easy to roll into a daily routine (try parking a little further away from work, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health campaigns and community-based programs can emphasize the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes, providing resources and support to facilitate increased fast walking within all communities," &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/pick-up-the-pace-of-your-daily-walk-to-boost-longevity-experts-say"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Lili Liu, from Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.107738"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventative Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like 100 million Americans, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-5e06b4d0-6cdf-11f0-8362-91360a9136f9"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; grandmother-of-two was prediabetic and about 30 pounds overweight. Combined with family history, she had three of the most &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14599453/harvard-experts-overlooked-risk-factors-dementia-preventable.html"&gt;common risk factors for dementia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just a few miles away, Patty Kelly cared for her mother for 'a very painful seven years' while she, too, battled dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The hardest time to me was when my two sons came to visit her, and she looked up at them and had no idea who they were. They were in their 30s at the time, and they walked out of the room crying,' Kelly, now 81, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At that point it was like, "How can I make sure they don't go through that with me?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an effort to break the cycle, Jones and Kelly took part in the US POINTER trial, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;the country's most comprehensive study&lt;/a&gt; showing simple lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can stave off cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, unveiled this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in Toronto, showed people who followed a strict routine of aerobic and strength exercises, kept to a careful diet and formed social connections for two years had improved cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Phyllis Jones (left) and Patty Kelly (right) both participated in the groundbreaking US POINTER trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also slowed their brains' aging by one to two years on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both women told the Daily Mail they lost weight, lowered their cholesterol and improved their mental health since starting the first-of-its-kind study, and they plan to continue following the routines they created in an effort to ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also believe they may have broken their families' generational curses and changed the predetermined paths toward dementia they were on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Finding out about the US POINTER study was one of the best things that could have happened to me,' Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm forever grateful.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rachel Whitmer, study co-author and chief in the division of epidemiology at the University of California, Davis, told the Daily Mail that attracting subjects 'was a tall order'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're recruiting people who don't have a healthy lifestyle, but have a family history,' Dr Whitmer explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though they don't already have a healthy lifestyle, they're willing to come in here and make a change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About two in five Americans over the age of 55 years will eventually develop dementia, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;estimates suggest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 514,000 Americans are currently diagnosed with dementia every year, a figure that is expected to double to 1 million by 2060. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the estimated 7.2 million people currently living with dementia, the vast majority have Alzheimer's disease, &lt;span&gt;a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys memory, thinking skills and even the ability to carry out simple day to day tasks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US POINTER was inspired by a Finnish study first released a decade ago called FINGER. Like POINTER, the study enrolled 1,260 older adults who all had risk factors for dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FINGER study found people who followed the lifestyle interventions had 25 percent improvement in overall cognitive function compared to the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We needed to figure out a way to do it here,' Dr Whitmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US POINTER study enrolled 2,111 adults from five sites across the US and followed them for two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart shows changes in cognitive scores over time among people who implemented structured changes and those who implemented self-guided ones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 'structured' group followed a strict exercise and diet plan and had regular meetings with other members of their 'teams' and their doctors to track their progress. The other 'self-guided' group made their own changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the trial sites was Chicago, where Jones and Kelly met in 2022 as members of the structured group.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite never meeting previously, the women turned out to live within five miles of each other in the Chicago suburbs. They started going to their local Y for Silver Sneakers exercise classes designed for seniors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones said she had 'trouble making it through the first 30 minutes' of the group classes when she first started out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the beginning of the study, Jones tried a variety of muscle strengthening classes like barre and yoga but had to wear braces on her knees, ankles and back to support her weak joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't need any of that stuff now,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones also noticed she went from staring at the clock during a workout and waiting for it to be over to time flying by, especially when she exercises with her VR headset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Kelly would frequently take walks around her neighborhood, she had never focused brisk walking, which raises heart rate over time and improves fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The POINTER team showed her how to gradually increase her pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was big for me,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows dementia risk divided by geographic region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also advised to follow a 'MIND' diet, which combines tenets of the Mediterranean and DASH (dietary approaches to stopping hypertension) diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's been shown to lower dementia risk by emphasizing brain-healthy foods such as leafy green vegetables, berries, nuts, olive oil, lean fish and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of the study, participants were given questionnaires on their dietary habits and assigned a score from zero to 14, with higher scores indicating a more brain-healthy diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly initially scored a five, which she later found out 'was one of the worst scores possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after two years, the MIND diet 'is like a Bible to me now,' Kelly said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, she scored 13.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She still keeps the chart of recommended foods on her fridge and makes copies when she travels. Even when she arrived at AAIC as part of the POINTER reveal, she had a copy of the diet in her luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me the big thing was the MIND diet and how it helped me, you know,' Kelly told the Daily Mail. 'I saw my cholesterol go down, so that was so exciting for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Rachel Whitmer (pictured), study co-author and chief in the Division of Epidemiology at the University of California, Davis told the Daily Mail that US POINTER was the 'hardest' but 'most rewarding' study she has been part of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Phyllis Jones (pictured) said US POINTER helped her lose 30 pounds and reversed her prediabetes, lowering her risk of developing dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also asked to complete 'Brain HQ' cognitive exercises several times per week, which have helped Kelly feel more confident with driving. For the first time in years, her two sons will ride in the car with her instead of insisting on driving themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the study, Jones has lost 30 pounds, and 11 inches off of her waistline. She's also no longer prediabetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her family has now adopted her new habits: Her son and daughter have both made adjustments to their diets, and Jones' 7-year-old granddaughter even insists on having a salad with her school lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're picking up all these habits and all of these changes that I'm bringing,' Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and Kelly both told the Daily Mail building up the changes they made slowly helped keep them motivated and prevented them from quitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Whitmer agrees, saying, 'What I also love about the study is we didn't have everyone do everything right away - we built up. We didn't want them to quit. Getting people to change their behavior is the hardest thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think the reason why it worked and people stayed in it was that it was like a gradual ramp up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones and Kelly became friends throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jones said Kelly is 'my inspiration - this is how I want to be when I'm 81.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they aren't the only participants to form a newfound bond. Dr Whitmer also noted at least one couple got married during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think it's great that people can hold each other accountable,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The POINTER team plans to observe the participants for another four years and publish additional studies looking at the reasons behind the improvements. They also plan to expand to 10 additional sites across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been doing this research for 26 years. This was the hardest study to ever do, but the most rewarding,' Dr Whitmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can't modify family history, but you can modify some of these risk factors and the way that you live.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians recommend supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and soy protein to reduce your cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts also recommend talking with your provider about plant sterols and psyllium husks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other lifestyle changes, like quitting smoking and reducing saturated fat in your diet, can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High cholesterol affects about 10% of adults living in the U.S., but experts estimate that many more have high cholesterol levels and have no idea. High cholesterol is silent—the only way to tell if you have elevated numbers ( ≥240 mg/dL of total cholesterol) is by getting a simple blood test.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s important to know if your cholesterol is high because hypercholesterolemia increases your risk for other conditions, like atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque in your arteries that can lead to a heart attack and/or stroke. While there are certain risk factors, like your age and genetics, that you can’t control, there are other factors, like your diet and lifestyle, that you can.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant sterols are compounds found in plants that have a similar structure to cholesterol. Because of this, plant sterols can help block cholesterol absorption in the gut, which in turn helps keep blood cholesterol levels in check. Manaker shares, “Plant sterols work by competing with cholesterol for absorption in the digestive system. This means &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/portfolio-diet-can-lower-cholesterol-research-shows-8399518" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less cholesterol gets absorbed&lt;/a&gt; into your bloodstream, which can help lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels without affecting HDL ("good") cholesterol.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A meta-analysis explored a variety of nutraceuticals, including plant sterols, and the impact they had on blood lipid levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While research designs are challenging to do on humans with this particular supplement, the body of research continues to support the inclusion of plant sterols as part of an intervention designed to lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine also notes that plant sterol supplements have shown promise in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-weekly-to-lower-high-cholesterol-11703900" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; when taken with meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While they are overall safe and pose minimal risk, individuals with specific genetic conditions may be at an increased risk of heart disease when the supplement is consumed in excess.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This popular &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fiber-supplements-8548491" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt; has made a name for itself in weight loss, cholesterol management and blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Amidor recommends this supplement for cholesterol management, given its longstanding research in the area. In fact, a review highlights the cholesterol-lowering effects this supplement has on humans. Notably, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplement-to-poop-11762356" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;soluble fiber in psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; helps lower LDL cholesterol levels through binding to bile acids in the intestines. This helps remove them from the body, which in turn lowers cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there are some downsides to this supplement, like its interaction with other medications and ability to hinder absorption of other nutrients and calories from foods, it’s best to work with your provider to identify the dosage that may be best for you.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy protein has been shown to have a positive impact on cholesterol levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis explored the impact that soy protein supplementation had on postmenopausal women and their cholesterol levels. Scientists found soy protein supplementation demonstrated a significant impact on cholesterol levels, noting a reduction of total cholesterol levels and an increase of HDL cholesterol levels (the “good” cholesterol).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Manaker shares that soy protein’s impact on cholesterol levels is due to its ability to “reduce the liver’s production of cholesterol and increase the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One important point when it comes to soy protein supplementation is that the research shows &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7969228/is-soy-bad-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;food sources of soy protein&lt;/a&gt; yield better results than a pill form of soy protein, likely due to the other nutrients found in soy products.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Manaker recommends considering more tofu, soy milk, edamame and soy protein powders in your diet to start. The good news, too, is that there is little risk associated with consuming more soy protein in your diet (unless you have a soy protein allergy).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While supplements can be used as a safety net, they are not a replacement for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet or lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt; that have proven to support cholesterol levels. Amidor and Manaker recommend considering these other strategies to support healthy cholesterol levels: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit saturated fat. &lt;/strong&gt;Saturated fat can raise LDL cholesterol levels, impacting your heart health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming no more than 10% of your daily calories from saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To make smarter choices, choose lean and extra-lean cuts of meat and trim visible fat off your meat when preparing it. Reducing consumption of cheese, full-fat dairy and processed meats is also a great way to reduce saturated fat in your diet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat more fruits and vegetables. &lt;/strong&gt;Filled with fiber and antioxidants, fruits and vegetables help improve diet quality and lower one’s risk of chronic disease. Yet, only 10% of people in the U.S. eat the recommended daily fruits and veggies. Make a conscious effort to add one serving of either a fruit or veggie at every meal and snack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy fatty fish (like salmon) twice per week. &lt;/strong&gt;Up your intakes of those omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA by consuming fatty fish at least twice per week. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/21611/ingredients/fish-seafood/fish/salmon/canned/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Enlisting the help of canned salmon &lt;/a&gt;is an excellent dietitian-approved swap to make mealtime magic happen with these fish. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose foods with the American Heart Association’s Heart Check Mark. &lt;/strong&gt;An easy way to navigate the market is by looking for foods with the heart-check logo. This means items have been vetted by the American Heart Association and have lower fat, sodium and added sugar than other items. But, as with all foods, even a heart-check approved snack food should still be consumed in moderation. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly. &lt;/strong&gt;Regular movement is an excellent way to improve cholesterol levels and can help manage stress levels (another factor that can indirectly affect your lipid levels). In fact, research shows that moderate and high-intensity movement improves HDL cholesterol levels (the good one).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Starting small with a walking routine is a wonderful way to invite more movement into your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking and vaping, and limit alcohol. &lt;/strong&gt;Smoking and drinking both increase one’s cholesterol levels. Quitting smoking is a great idea if you have high cholesterol. Alcohol is a known carcinogen and should be reduced. If the thought of giving it up stresses you out more, stick to standard serving sizes when you do enjoy a glass of wine (which is a 5-ounce pour).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition and lifestyle play a critical role in managing high cholesterol levels. But there are four supplements that may offer some benefits, too. For example, nutrition experts recommend adding the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, as well as soy protein, into your regular routine. Talk with your provider if you want to consider adding psyllium husk or plant sterols as part of your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-cholesterol-diet-plan-11779198" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering plan&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working with your individual provider to tailor a plan for you is the best way to ensure you learn how to proactively manage your cholesterol long-term in the way that’s right for you. Other lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, limiting alcohol intake, getting regular exercise and reducing saturated fat in your diet, may also benefit your cholesterol levels.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty-eight people have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease since July 25, 2025 and two people have died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who have been in the affected area since late July  who have flu-like symptoms, fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should seek immediate medical attention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 4, 2025 — &lt;/strong&gt;Today, the NYC Health Department provided an update on the investigation into a community cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem (ZIP codes 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037, and 10039) and bordering communities. Fifty-eight people have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease since July 25, 2025 and two people have died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remediation required by the Department has been completed for the 11 cooling towers with initial positive screening results showing the presence of &lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt;, a type of bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People living or working in the area with flu-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, chills, muscle aches, or difficulty breathing should contact a health care provider immediately. It is especially important for people at higher risk — including those ages 50 and older, cigarette smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems — to get care if they have symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible," said &lt;strong&gt;Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse&lt;/strong&gt;. "Legionnaires’ disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older and those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions, should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;, which grows in warm water. People can get Legionnaires’ disease by breathing in water vapor that contains Legionella bacteria. Legionnaires’ disease cannot be transmitted from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics. Complications from the disease are less likely the earlier treatment begins. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease can be caused by plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for &lt;em&gt;Legionella growth&lt;/em&gt;, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems. &lt;/p&gt;

But if retinoids aren’t for you, then &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/vitamin-c-guide-skin-benefits-concentration-absorption" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; has also been proven to support collagen synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of low collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brittle hair and nails&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hair thinning or excessive hair shedding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of skin elasticity and crepey skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;At what age should one start focusing on increasing collagen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really, from your mid-20s, as this is when collagen production in the skin and body begins to slow down. That’s not to say that starting in your 30s, 40s, or 50s is fruitless; it just means you may need to stay the course of collagen-stimulating treatments and products longer before you see results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Professional treatments to stimulate collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hands of a professional, collagen induction therapy includes treatments such as microneedling, radio frequency, and ultrasound skin tightening, as well as laser. “Ablative lasers burn tiny holes into the skin that have to heal, a process that prompts collagen production,” explains Craythorne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injectables also have a role to play, with some types of filler specifically designed to stimulate collagen production. These create an immediate plumping effect (filler is made up of hyaluronic acid molecules), but also encourage the body to produce more collagen naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biostimulatory fillers such as Radiesse (calcium hydroxylapatite) offer long-term collagen stimulation along with volume restoration, making them ideal for mature skin,” Shotter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRP therapy is another option and involves injecting “platelet-rich plasma derived from your own blood.” This accelerates tissue repair, enhances collagen production, and can be combined with microneedling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other lifestyle changes to support healthy collagen levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is key. “Your body needs vitamin C, zinc, manganese, and copper to produce collagen, so it’s important to have these in your diet,” Shotter explains. A &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/collagen-rich-foods" target="_blank"&gt;collagen-rich diet&lt;/a&gt; can pay dividends when it comes to skin health, too. Focus on foods like bone broth, salmon, and egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that you get enough sleep and take steps to manage your stress levels. “This supports hormonal balance and skin regeneration,” says Dr Shin-Young Cho, Korean specialist dermatologist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://futurecaremedical.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://futurecaremedical.com/"}' href="https://futurecaremedical.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Future Care Medical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, dermatologists aren’t huge fans of using supplements to boost collagen stores, because there’s no conclusive evidence to show that collagen peptides actually make their way to the skin. Craythorne does, however, agree that they can improve skin hydration when taken regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cFSKbf gBsRaY grid grid-even grid-items-2 GroupCalloutWrapper-cfrXZg

Here are some of the best skincare products for collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Retinol and Retinoids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Retinoids, such as retinol, retinal, and doctor-prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-is-tretinoin" target="_blank"&gt;tretinoin&lt;/a&gt;—are the gold standard, directly stimulating fibroblasts to increase collagen production and improve skin texture over time,” Shotter explains. Not only that, but retinoids can help with skin elasticity restoration, improving firmness and rough or bumpy skin texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C is another critical element in collagen synthesis and also “protects against oxidative damage,” says Shotter. “Peptides can signal to the skin to repair and rebuild collagen, though their effects are milder than retinoids, but they can be used synergistically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GridWrapper-cFSKbf gBsRaY grid grid-even grid-items-2

The untimely heart attack takes the lives of many without presenting any unmistakable symptoms in the wake of medical developments. But what if there were a simple blood test that could warn of a heart attack years before it would take place? The recent advances in cardiovascular diagnostics are trying to fulfil this dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The power of &lt;keyword id="23031116" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="predictive-biomarkers" source="keywords"&gt;predictive biomarkers&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists”, as Dumont et al. have demonstrated, “have found certain proteins and enzymes and inflammatory markers in blood which, if they appeared in higher than normal concentration, indicated that the person was at risk of cardiovascular disease long before any clinical presentation.” High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is one such marker. It signifies inflammation in the vessels of the heart-a silent trigger in most heart attacks. A protein blood test (genetic lipo/protein analysis) can predict heart attack risk by detecting elevated lipoprotein(a) levels linked to inherited cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troponin comes next on this list of probable biomarkers. Troponin is primarily used to identify heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troponin levels are elevated only a small amount, it has called to attention heart muscle stress or damage in the form of an early warning, years before. The other factor that has risen into prominence as a strong factor for early onset heart disease, especially in South Asians, is lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), a genetic form of cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unprecedented prospect for cardiovascular health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, where CVDs affect younger populations, it is very much important to go in for early intervention. With urban lifestyles, increasing sedentarism, and the rising stress level, the younger lot itself is under threat. But for most routine checks, no one does anything else beyond reading cholesterol and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a little bit more of a proactive approach involving cardiac biomarkers testing, risk individuals could be identified earlier, so that they could then eliminate risk through lifestyle modification, early treatment with medication, or further diagnostic evaluation if warranted. This testing can be simple, non-fasting blood tests , no guruji, no stress test, no invasive procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technology meets precision medicine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI biomarker data integration is giving the jewel more shine. Advanced AI modeling techniques can now analyze the patient profile, which could include blood test results, genetic data, and lifestyle risk factors, and arrive at an individualized estimate of one's 10-year or even lifetime risk of developing heart disease. This individualized prediction and risk stratification allows for targeted prevention, rather than generic public-health-based preventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A wake-up call for routine screening&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these breakthroughs, public awareness and access remain barriers. Don't wait and wait until you suddenly have a heart attack and need an operation. We must shift our mindset from “reactive treatment” to “proactive prevention.” Including advanced cardiac biomarkers in annual health checks could be the key to reducing India’s heart attack toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks don't just happen overnight, the silent damage increases over years. A basic blood check, administered at the right time, might provide a life-saving early alert. While science is arming us with tools, it’s up to us as individuals, as doctors, as policymakers to act now before it’s too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sameer Bhati Public Health Expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>克拉克马斯县居民在遇到受感染的蝙蝠后接受狂犬病治疗- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="22JBRC2XDBGPDI2MZIVP2NS3U4"&gt;Clackamas County health officials say a bat found in a Molalla home tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TU4KK74IQVBLTBCHCE3HKKAZKA"&gt;The bat was captured after it came into contact with a resident in the home.

According to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Rabies%20is%20deadly,disease%20is%20nearly%20always%20fatal." target="_blank" rel=""&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, human fatalities are rare and typically occur in people who don’t get treatment quickly after a scratch or bite from an infected animal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGEFK77B2NEFFMYHTP4TP7CH6Q"&gt;Over the past five years, the county has seen one bat per year that has tested positive for rabies, according to Dr. Sarah Present, Clackamas County’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UX3K24KQZJE4BEKM7F542EU3KQ"&gt;Health officials say the summer brings more encounters with bats — Oregon’s top rabies threat. About 8% of bats tested in the state are found to carry the virus, but officials say the actual rate in the wild is likely lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YMSWXEVATVGDZKPWCBPS3RYOJ4"&gt;Foxes can also spread rabies, but health officials say that human encounters with them are uncommon.

Trends show that people across the country are turning to stand-alone surgery and imaging centers to keep out-of-pocket costs low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Intermountain endoscopy center is already open in Sandy, on the Alta View Hospital campus, and the other two are planned near Riverton Hospital and at  McKay-Dee Hospital, in Ogden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three centers will provide colonoscopies and other endoscopy procedures to examine the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. These procedures can help address swallowing difficulties, abdominal pain, chronic bowel issues and hemorrhoids, as well as diagnose serious conditions like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis and/or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Digestive health is coming more to the forefront as Americans are paying more attention to healthy eating, nutrition, gut health and maintaining a healthy weight. Intermountain Health is helping patients be more proactive about their digestive health through comprehensive, team-based care with each patient," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health said offering endoscopy services in a lower-cost setting is a way the organization can meet its nonprofit mission to improve the overall health of the communities it serves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locations will be managed by Surgery Partners, a company that already operates multiple Intermountain Health surgery centers in Utah, in addition to locations in 29 other states. Merriman said the company's philosophy of providing high-quality and cost-effective solutions aligns with Intermountain Health's mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being one of the more preventable forms of cancer, colon cancer caused about 53,000 deaths in the United States last year, according to the American Cancer Society, which estimates more than 100,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colonoscopy screening is recommended starting at age 45, or earlier for people with a family history of colon cancer. A colonoscopy does not require a referral for treatment at the Alta View Endoscopy Center, but upper endoscopy procedures will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Vaccine skepticism in the U.S. kills more children outside the U.S. — because it transfers that skepticism — than it does inside the United States,” Gates said during a discussion at a STAT event in Cambridge, Mass., where he was speaking about a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/04/bill-gates-foundation-womens-maternal-health-funding-announcement/"&gt;$2.5 billion pledge to women’s health initiatives&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe title="Bill Gates on worldwide impact of vaccine skepticism in the U.S." src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/58JnzPulN6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gates, founder and head of the Gates Foundation, was asked by STAT’s Matthew Herper about the mounting debate in the United States — led by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — about what many vaccine experts believe are settled issues around vaccine safety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A vaccine panel Kennedy appointed to advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/rfk-jr-new-acip-panel-bans-thimerosal-in-flu-shots-preservative-long-a-target-of-antivax-activists/"&gt;voted in late June&lt;/a&gt; to require all flu vaccine doses marketed in the U.S. to be free of thimerosal, a preservative that has a long safety record but that the anti-vaccine movement believes is harmful. More recently, Kennedy has taken public aim at &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/14/aluminum-in-vaccines-large-danish-study-finds-no-link-to-autism-asthma-allergies/"&gt;a large Danish study&lt;/a&gt; that found no evidence of an association between aluminum salts — used in some vaccines to boost the immune response they generate — and a range of conditions such as asthma and autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gates noted that in the developing world, where children’s underlying health status can be more tenuous than is the norm in the United States, measles infections can lead to a substantially higher death rate than is seen in richer countries.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He also noted that the Gates Foundation has been funding work on a combined polio, malaria, and measles vaccine, one that would be delivered via a patch rather than an injection. Underlying the work seems to be the hope that measles could be a target for eradication — effectively wiping the pathogen off the face of the planet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only one human disease, smallpox, has ever been eradicated. The world has been struggling for nearly four decades to eradicate polio, with the Gates Foundation as the lead funder of that effort at this point. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles, too, could be a target for eradication, because the virus only infects people; it has no other animal reservoir. So if transmission among people could be stopped with high vaccination rates, the virus would die out. But growing resistance to measles vaccines, which many in the anti-vax movement blame for the rise in autism rates, could take that ambition off the table, Gates said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now we’re going to have to say, does rich country skepticism alone mean that we will not take on measles eradication?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the issue of polio eradication, Gates said he believes it can still be achieved. Only two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, have never managed to stop transmission of polio viruses. The two countries combined have reported &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/wild-poliovirus-count/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;19 cases&lt;/a&gt; of paralytic polio so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked if he thought polio eradication was still worth the investment, Gates said to cease the effort would see a return to a situation where as many as 100,000 children would be paralyzed annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have a choice. You can stop spending that money and have polio spread back and have global health have a huge failure. You wouldn’t go back to the peak because as you improve sanitation in countries … so economic development slowly reduces that. So it won’t come back in big numbers to rich countries, but it will come back in gigantic numbers to Africa and Asia,” he suggested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gates said he believes the goal is still reachable, but acknowledged the foundation’s substantial spending on the project could be coloring his views.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once you spend billions of dollars on something, maybe you’re biased towards hoping that it works,” he said. “But I think I’m being objective to say, no, this is money that we’re going to continue to spend.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also expressed some hope that the massive aid funding cuts that the U.S. government instituted with the closing of the U.S. Agency for International Development may eventually be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I do think that we’ll make the case for a lot of that funding to be restored; at least we’re going to do the best on that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"It's important information that drinkers should have access to. But telling people alcohol causes cancer is just part of the solution – we also need to give them ways to take action to reduce their risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption can be attributed to as many as 7 percent of premature deaths worldwide, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, and making drinkers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/moderate-drinking-is-not-good-for-you-after-all-study-finds"&gt;more aware&lt;/a&gt; of the health risks is one way of tackling that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While health agencies have also looked at ways of making booze less readily available and more expensive, ultimately, personal choices will determine whether or not &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-explain-what-drinking-while-on-medication-can-do-to-your-body"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-alcohol-on-planes-may-pose-a-hidden-danger-heres-why"&gt;around alcohol&lt;/a&gt; will shift in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg" alt="Different hands holding drinks" class="size-medium wp-image-146115" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Overdoing it on the booze is associated with a whole range of problems.

&lt;p&gt;Smoking leaves more than just a bad taste in your mouth — it could be fueling your oral cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11888749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies have consistently reported&lt;/a&gt; that cigarette users are five to 10 times more likely to develop oral cancer than non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/cannabis-use-disorder-triples-risk-of-oral-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A new study out of UC San Diego&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a chronic weed habit carries a higher risk of oral cancer as well. Researchers determined that people who often smoke marijuana are 3.25 times more likely to contract the disease within five years compared to those without cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers determined that people who often smoke marijuana are 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer within five years compared to those without cannabis use disorder. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis smoke contains many of the same &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/03/another-reminder-that-smoking-absolutely-destroys-your-lungs/"&gt;carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke&lt;/a&gt;, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth,” said &lt;a href="https://clre.ucsd.edu/faculty/raphael-cuomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Raphael Cuomo&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic or problematic cannabis use may contribute to cancer risk in tissues exposed to combustion products.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Oral cancer encompasses cancers of the lips, tongue, gums and the lining of the cheeks and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Cancer Society projects&lt;/a&gt; that there will be nearly 60,000 new US cases of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer this year and about 12,800 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Oral cancer encompasses cancers of the lips, tongue, gums and the lining of the cheeks and mouth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TommyStockProject – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Known risk factors of oral cancer include tobacco use, chronic alcohol consumption and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/health/oral-sex-is-fueling-oropharyngeal-cancer-surgeon-says/"&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV) infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cuomo’s team analyzed health data from over 45,000 oral cancer patients, including 949 who had been formally diagnosed with cannabis use disorder. They accounted for age, sex, body mass index and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They calculated that tobacco smokers with a cannabis addiction are 624% more likely to contract oral cancer within five years compared to cigarette users not prone to smoking marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers posited that the inhaled smoke is to blame because it can damage mouth tissues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edibles and beverages infused with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis, don’t seem to carry a similar oral cancer risk as smoking weed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Research is still evolving, so regular self-checks and dental exams remain wise for all cannabis users,” Cuomo told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;His findings were published&lt;/a&gt; in the September edition of Preventive Medicine Reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies have consistently reported that cigarette users are five to 10 times more likely to develop oral cancer than non-smokers. The risk goes up if cigarette smokers also smoke weed. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that there should be more exploration of the long-term effects of cannabis, and oral health awareness should be highlighted in substance use disorder treatment and counseling.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The UCSD study is not the first to sound the alarm about cannabis use and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/health/marijuana-use-tied-to-higher-risk-of-head-neck-cancers-study/"&gt;A 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Southern California linked daily marijuana use to a three to five-fold increase in the risk of head and neck cancers. Oral cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuomo suggests seeing a dentist or an ear, nose and throat specialist if you have a sore, ulcer or red or white patch in your mouth that has not healed after two weeks, especially if you have a lump, numbness, bleeding or pain when swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Early evaluation is critical because oral cancers caught in the first stage are usually curable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

The bat was later captured and tested at the Oregon State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Those tests came back positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a deadly illness that can be prevented with treatment immediately after someone is exposed.
