When a person with TB coughs, speaks or sings, germs are expelled into the air -- where they can linger for several hours -- before another person breathes in the air and becomes infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Signs and symptoms&lt;/a&gt; include a cough that lasts for three weeks or longer, coughing up blood or phlegm, chest pain, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, fever, chills and night sweats, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some people become infected with TB germs that live in the body for years without causing illness.

The idea of sprouting another tooth by simply taking a pill has sounded like pure science fiction in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dentinova.co.uk/2025/02/26/dr-katsu-takahashi-a-visionary-in-teeth-regeneration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katsu Takahashi&lt;/a&gt; and his team at the Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital in Osaka, Japan, have been exploring the possibility of helping people grow new teeth. The clinical trial began in July 2024 in hopes of making the treatment publicly available by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-missing-teeth-and-protein"&gt;Missing teeth and protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24168-anodontia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anodontia&lt;/a&gt; rate of around &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0528.2004.00158.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population presents a problem for those who cannot develop a complete set of permanent teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition can affect speech and eating from an early age. Traditional treatments often involve dentures or dental implants, but these approaches can carry inconveniences for young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the new therapy could help children aged 2 to 6 who lack adult teeth. They are examining a way to block a protein linked with limiting tooth growth in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-blocking-breakthrough"&gt;Protein blocking breakthrough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, scientists discovered that the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf1798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USAG-1 protein&lt;/a&gt; plays a direct role in regulating the development of new teeth. When this protein is active, it can prevent additional teeth from forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By crafting a medication to neutralize it, Takahashi’s team encouraged animals to grow teeth beyond their normal sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their medication on mice with missing teeth. They observed tooth development in those mice where none had grown before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-discovery-matters"&gt;Why the discovery matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are born with two sets of teeth. Yet some animals – like sharks – regrow many sets as needed. Scientists once believed humans did not have any spare tooth buds beyond baby and adult teeth, but evidence now suggests we have a latent third set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of growing new teeth is every dentist’s dream. I’ve been working on this since I was a graduate student. I was confident I’d be able to make it happen,” said Takahashi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals show a tendency toward &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/hyperdontia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hyperdontia&lt;/a&gt;, which means they form extra teeth. One in three such cases involves growth of a third set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-animal-research-on-protein-and-teeth"&gt;Animal research on protein and teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32922570/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; paved the way for studies in ferrets. The medication spurred the growth of an extra front tooth, suggesting that ferrets – like mice – possess the capacity for additional sets. It showed that what was once dormant could be nudged into action with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize the potential impact for those with tooth agenesis, another term for missing teeth. Many with missing teeth struggle from an early age due to problems with speech and chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-human-benefits"&gt;Potential human benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in humans will aim to confirm the therapy’s safety. Takahashi believes an added set of teeth might someday become a realistic option for those who have lost teeth or never formed them in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In any case, we’re hoping to see a time when tooth-regrowth medicine is a third choice alongside dentures and implants,” said Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists typically turn to implants or dentures, which require maintenance and can be uncomfortable. The proposed medication seeks to offer a biological alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-on-the-road-ahead"&gt;Challenges on the road ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe human testing remains a key goal. Regulatory reviews will be crucial to confirm there are no adverse effects. The team hopes that in six years, regrowing teeth for therapeutic purposes will be a common procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in genetics has opened possibilities for medicine that once seemed too ambitious. Understanding how to spur a new set of teeth is a major step in combining genetics and dentistry for practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shaping-the-future-of-dentistry"&gt;Shaping the future of dentistry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists around the world have been intrigued by similar regenerative procedures. Some labs study &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910408300703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, while others explore chemical triggers for tooth development. The search for a viable therapy has been active for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takahashi’s approach hinges on a well-defined protein target. If successful, it might also encourage the development of treatments for other dental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication contains an antibody designed to block USAG-1. When that happens, tooth buds have fewer barriers stopping them from maturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By directing the body’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-happens-to-our-teeth-as-we-age-new-details-have-emerged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural growth process&lt;/a&gt;, researchers aim to produce strong and fully formed teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that those who never had a complete set can finally grow a replacement. Many doctors see it as a potential game-changer in oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-optimism"&gt;Signs of optimism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, missing teeth lead to lifelong issues. Families handle multiple rounds of dental visits for children in need of prosthetics or implants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these trials confirm the safety and effectiveness of the therapy, the days of coping with artificial replacements might become less common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the journey from mouse studies to human trials can be long, Takahashi’s team is excited about the milestone. They view their discovery as a chance to rewrite what is possible for tooth restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research community will watch these clinical trials in Japan to see if the technique can be reliably repeated in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it works, it may shape a future where anyone could regrow a natural tooth. That prospect alone has generated plenty of curiosity and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:33:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNdkpPNzAwUFFKdXcwMVpSdEdYdGZRWGVYQUQybU1YdVdoOGZnQjlzT2xQcnplNDFvSEJvbDd2ei10ZHVmQkVkdEJUbVpCYlQwOFkzNXR5bVRNNWNfOFlEUXZtV0tibWtzY0ZjTFhKWUJxT0czMzJfX0lUMmZNWjluVExoeG0tQWlZaUhocEpjMi0xdmR6dHJmRlpLZlhhTEUyc2x6Z01n</guid></item><item><title>一名潜水员参观了一条堕落的鲸鱼。当他回来时，它已经消失了。-《纽约时报》 | A Diver Visited a Fallen Whale.

As he descended, a hulking mass took shape below him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There, at an exceptionally shallow 115 feet, lay the body of a baby gray whale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Whale falls are usually not seen by human divers. Typically, they are discovered by remotely operated vehicles at depths exceeding 3,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Local marine biologists had a guess as to the gray whale calf’s origins. An animal that matched what was found on the seafloor had been spotted swimming near La Jolla Shores, desperately searching for its mother. During its final hours, it was seen approaching boats, as though asking for help that wasn’t coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because it was the first time in memory that a fall was so accessible to people, other divers quickly made their way to the site.

Inattention and anxiety appear to reinforce each other in girls, but not in boys, where hyperactivity is the more predictive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that these findings could improve early diagnosis and intervention for young girls, who are often overlooked due to their quiet or daydreamy demeanor. Early support may prevent later mental health issues, offering a path toward more targeted, sex-specific approaches to ADHD care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Inattention predicts anxiety in girls, while hyperactivity predicts it in boys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undiagnosed ADHD:&lt;/strong&gt; Girls with inattentive-type ADHD are often diagnosed late due to subtler symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying inattention before age 12 could prevent anxiety later on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NTNU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) have found new correlations between ADHD and anxiety, which are two major health issues among adolescents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two disorders often co-occur in individuals, and recent findings now reveal that the relationship between them appears to be different in girls and boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109382"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a girl and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The NTNU researchers hope their findings can demonstrate the importance of early detection of ADHD in children. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apparent differences between girls and boys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several types of ADHD, and the researchers’ findings are related to one specific type called the &lt;em&gt;inattentive type&lt;/em&gt;. A higher percentage of girls have this type of ADHD. Boys often have a different type of ADHD called the &lt;em&gt;hyperactive-impulsive type&lt;/em&gt;. Some people can have both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, we have identified a link between anxiety and inattentive type ADHD, and we find that this only applies to girls,” said Professor Lars Wichstrøm at the Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprised by major differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time researchers have investigated – and demonstrated – that the relationship between ADHD and anxiety differs according to sex, and that it is linked to inattention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We assumed there were differences between the sexes, but we did not expect them to be so significant,” said Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that they have studied inattention as a symptom of ADHD, rather than ADHD as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocal relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two disorders seem to reinforce each other. In girls, the prevalence of inattention increases the likelihood of more severe symptoms of anxiety disorders during childhood and adolescence. In addition, anxiety during adolescence increases the likelihood of the inattention worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no such correlation between inattention and anxiety in boys. However, they found that increased hyperactivity-impulsivity in the first few years of school increased the likelihood of developing anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders increase significantly during adolescence, especially for girls. The NTNU study concludes that early detection and effective treatment of inattention symptoms in girls can reduce the risk of anxiety later on in life. Similarly, interventions or treatment for anxiety can reduce the likelihood of attention deficit difficulties becoming more severe in young girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that ADHD and anxiety often co-occur in individuals. According to Wichstrøm, only a small part of this comorbidity can be explained by shared genetics between ADHD and anxiety. We also know that the intensity of ADHD symptoms and anxiety can vary over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we do not know why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the radar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, 5 per cent of children and adolescents have ADHD, both in Norway and in other countries where this has been studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety increases significantly in children as early as 12 years old. If we can identify inattention problems before that age, possibly as early as 8 years old, we may be able to reduce or prevent them from developing into anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls with inattentive type ADHD are often perceived as shy, introverted, absent-minded and daydreaming – or even lazy. As children, they often go under the radar because they rarely cause any trouble or disturb others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only symptom they have is inattention, and it can be difficult to distinguish this from simply being ‘normally’ distracted, disorganized, or forgetful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing out on help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that girls often receive the diagnosis later on in life. As a result, they miss out on interventions that might help limit the later development of anxiety, according to Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD is most prevalent in boys. It is easier to see and hear individuals who struggle with restlessness and hyperactivity, who cannot sit still or wait their turn. Thus, they tend to be identified earlier, receive a diagnosis, and get help more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggle and exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who struggle with basic skills can experience exclusion, bullying and other stressful challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personal and social challenges can easily lead to rumination, worry, anxiety and catastrophizing. It seems that girls are more vulnerable when they are exposed to negative life events or bullying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are more likely to respond with depression than boys,” explained Wichstrøm, who has done extensive research on anxiety and depression among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADHD is detected through anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still do not know if there are any common factors underlying and influencing why some individuals develop both anxiety and ADHD. What they do know is that the older an individual is when diagnosed, the more common it is for them to have inattentive type ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, as young people approach puberty, the prevalence of anxiety increases significantly – especially among girls, and it is only at that point that their ADHD is also detected,” explained Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for early signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU researchers hope their findings can demonstrate the importance of early detection of ADHD in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anxiety increases significantly in children as early as 12 years old. If we can identify inattention problems before that age, possibly as young as 8 years old, we may be able to reduce or prevent them from developing into anxiety,” said Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU researchers emphasize the need for more knowledge about the intricate connections between sex, ADHD and anxiety. An additional step could be to confirm the findings they have made in an even larger study. Wichstrøm would like to see further research on the very youngest girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping people with ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wichstrøm is fully aware of the debate about the overdiagnosis of ADHD. He says it is quite possible that too many people may end up with a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we must still strive to actually detect ADHD where it exists and help those who have it,” he said.Studied 1000 children and their parents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU study is an observational study. It is based on information from 1000 children born in 2003 and 2004 and their parents. The participants have been followed up every other year from the time the children were 4 years old until they turned 18. They are now young adults, turning 22 this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lars Wichstrøm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lars Wichstrøm – NTNU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reciprocal relations between dimensions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders from preschool age to adolescence: sex differences in a birth cohort sample&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Wichstrøm et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocal relations between dimensions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders from preschool age to adolescence: sex differences in a birth cohort sample&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0001-title"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prospectively related from childhood to adolescence. However, whether the two dimensions of ADHD—inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity—are differentially related to anxiety and whether there are developmental and sex/gender differences in these relations are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two birth cohorts of Norwegian children were assessed biennially from ages 4 to 16 (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,077; 49% girls) with diagnostic parent interviews used to assess symptoms of anxiety and ADHD. Data were analyzed using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model, adjusting for all unobserved time-invariant confounding effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In girls, increased inattention, but not hyperactivity-impulsivity, predicted increased anxiety 2 years later across all time-points and increased anxiety at ages 12 and 14 predicted increased inattention but not hyperactivity-impulsivity. In boys, increased hyperactivity-impulsivity at ages 6 and 8, but not increased inattention, predicted increased anxiety 2 years later, whereas increased anxiety did not predict increased inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two ADHD dimensions were differentially related to anxiety, and the relations were sex-specific. In girls, inattention may be involved in the development of anxiety throughout childhood and adolescence and anxiety may contribute to girls developing more inattention beginning in early adolescence. In boys, hyperactivity-impulsivity may be involved in the development of anxiety during the early school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective treatment of inattention symptoms in girls may reduce anxiety risk at all time-points, while addressing anxiety may decrease inattention during adolescence. Similarly, treating hyperactivity-impulsivity may reduce anxiety risk in boys during late childhood (at ages 8–10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:29:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE85RHM5M1pMWDQ1WkRzRkxuek5LOFkwSkY0RktCb1MxaWRxY21RVHVWS1dSMGNUU2tSVS1EUV9iOGV3OTJSRXhENVNJSmY2eFRURVV2eEpPbjhFZXF6cTdoaFJjV1g</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心早期数据显示，糖尿病死亡人数降至多年来的最低水平- CBS新闻 | Diabetes deaths fall to lowest levels in years, in early CDC figures - CBS News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPM1hERUxvVWgzc3hzWjJ2YjQ2a3hwWS1pT2xLdTVFaFJzVE9IcVRsYWM2VjNNRHk2OEd6WHduXzhjM1ZnOUx4SkMydnFibG9PU3pqS09hX2kyYXp5NkNpOVROTFVuSWpuY05fMnJiNW1BaGkxc2U5TlVVeGtsRlVxNFRONkhveDc0NTVB0gGQAUFVX3lxTE5Sb2tvR0NUOGxQaDI2cGJhaEtkU0xtMUpsSkQwVHpBOWFjVEVsckhTVFh6aDZleUZSNTk1S2RhaTE3NkJOUVFVcWltQnJYdmk1UXEybk1sbHlKWkpVTUd2TFhSTE41OHhvTTdKZmcyakNyWkVxY05JUzBobmpTem5iajhteERIaU5kdUlhbDJZbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/diabetes/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/mortality-dashboard.htm#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D434F595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-08.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death," Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels," Holliday said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D434F599" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-declares-end-to-wegovy-and-ozempic-shortage/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;high demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/NHISDataQueryTool/SHS_adult/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568010/#ch36.s7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;caution&lt;/a&gt; that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main "underlying cause of death" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1882/elizabeth-selvin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Selvin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data," Selvin said.&lt;/p&gt;

The compound was well tolerated, with only mild side effects, and benefits persisted for weeks after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was primarily designed to test safety, researchers observed meaningful and lasting improvements in multiple symptoms. The findings suggest psilocybin may enhance neuroplasticity and reduce inflammation, helping the brain heal itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Improvements in mood, cognition, and movement lasted for weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Well Tolerated:&lt;/strong&gt; Mild side effects reported, but no serious adverse events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; A larger, multi-site trial will explore underlying mechanisms like neuroplasticity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psilocybin, a natural compound found in certain mushrooms, has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC San Francisco researchers wanted to know if it could be used to help Parkinson’s patients who often experience debilitating mood dysfunction in addition to their motor symptoms and don’t respond well to antidepressants or other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109366"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sitting and mushrooms." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did participants tolerate the drug without serious side effects or worsening symptoms, which is what the pilot study was designed to test, they also experienced clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function that lasted for weeks after the drug was out of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time a psychedelic has been tested on patients with any neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are still in very early stages of this work, but this first study went well beyond what we expected,” said the paper’s first author, Ellen Bradley, MD, assistant professor and associate director of UCSF’s Translational Psychedelic Research Program (TrPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people don’t realize this, but mood symptoms in Parkinson’s are linked to a faster physical decline,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And they are actually a stronger predictor of patients’ quality of life with Parkinson’s than their motor symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the TrPR Program, within UCSF’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Department of Neurology, teamed up to lead this project, which was funded by an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared online earlier this month in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psilocybin’s lasting mood and motor effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncontrolled movements due to abnormal brain activity, affects about 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medications like levodopa can relieve symptoms, there are no approved therapies to slow the progression or reverse the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common early physical symptoms include tremors and foot dragging, but Bradley said anxiety and depression in patients with no history of psychiatric problems often precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why standard medications often don’t work well for these patients, but mood changes could be part of the neurodegenerative disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the safety of psilocybin for these patients, the researchers gave seven men and five women with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease a 10 mg dose, followed two weeks later by a higher dose of 25 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients completed psychotherapy sessions before and after the psilocybin — eight sessions in total — and were evaluated for changes in mood, cognition, and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nearly all participants experienced some adverse events while on the psilocybin, such as anxiety, nausea, and elevated blood pressure, these were not serious enough to require medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had meaningful improvements in their mood, cognition, and motor symptoms at both their one-week and one-month follow-up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated the participants’ mood again three months after their psilocybin sessions and found it was still significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested a variety of explanations for the improvements. The beneficial impact of psilocybin on the patients’ mood could have led to better cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people feel better, and that, in turn, helps them socialize and become more active – both key elements of Parkinson’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An expansion into unchartered territory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this pilot study were promising enough that the researchers are conducting a larger randomized controlled trial at UCSF, enrolling a larger and more diverse group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study incorporates noninvasive brain stimulation, neuroimaging and other tools to understand how psilocybin impacts inflammation and neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will include a second site at Yale University, with the aim of enrolling 100 participants. This work will be funded by the same anonymous donor that paid for the safety pilot as well as by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of brain diseases still lack interventions that change the course of illness,” said the study’s senior author, Joshua Woolley, MD, PhD, associate professor at UCSF and director of the TrPR Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can often treat the symptoms, but we don’t alter the trajectory or prevent decline. Now, that’s beginning to change. These results raise the exciting possibility that psilocybin may help the brain repair itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional co-authors include Kimberly Sakai, BA, Gisele Fernandes-Osterhold, MFT, Balázs Szigeti, PhD, Connie Ludwig, PhD, Jill L.

Hospitals &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/routine-bloodwork-lab-work-tests-surprise-bill/" target="_blank"&gt;typically charge much more&lt;/a&gt; than physicians’ offices or independent commercial labs for the same tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IN6CCVQ3KZGHVGBZLGPHC35S3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The distinction between a preventive visit and a diagnostic one is important for billing purposes: It dictates who is on the hook for the bill. A preventive visit generally comes at no cost to patients. But a visit for an ongoing medical issue is usually classified as diagnostic, leaving the patient subject to co-pays and deductibles — or even &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bill-of-the-month-annual-physical-surprise-charge/" target="_blank"&gt;charged for two separate appointments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDWQ3CGKZVEBVD6YKFHHXTM6MQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Patients may not notice a difference in the exam room.

For instance, most adults who never received the HPV vaccine do not know they are eligible, so it’s critical to inform them of their options, said Verda Hicks, a gynecologic oncologist based in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AQMITZYMF5CQBF3ALOJNMGETUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vaccine offers protection against nine types of HPV, she said. The vaccine also prevents HPV-related cancers in men, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends boys receive the immunization, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GYKF6C333JERVDA4KCRFZHUDA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Get vaccinated,” Hicks said. “We just do not have the same tools for many other cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQXCBFDSKJCFZPMNVAI637AERE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keep in mind that your coverage may vary — some insurance companies won’t cover the cost of the vaccine &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21613-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;for some older patients&lt;/a&gt; — and the same services may be subject to different cost-sharing rules depending on whether they are conducted for prevention vs. diagnosis. Also, prices can vary depending on where care is delivered and tests are performed. If you need a blood test, ask that your doctor send the requisition &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/routine-bloodwork-lab-work-tests-surprise-bill/" target="_blank"&gt;to a commercial, in-network lab&lt;/a&gt;.

A meta-analysis of 231 brain studies showed that chronic sleep disorders alter regions involved in emotions and memory, while short-term deprivation primarily affects attention and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings could pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive strategies for mental illnesses linked to poor sleep. Understanding these neural differences may also help develop treatments tailored to specific types of sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Brain Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep disorders affect the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, while short-term sleep loss impacts the thalamus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep loss raises the risk of depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform targeted therapies and future transdiagnostic studies across multiple sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About 20% to 35% of the population suffers from chronic sleep disorders—and up to half of all people in older age. Moreover, almost every teenager or adult has experienced short-term sleep deprivation at some point. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for not getting enough sleep, whether it be partying, a long day at work, caring for relatives, or simply whiling away time on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109362"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain on a bed." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent meta-study, Jülich researchers have now been able to show that the brain regions involved in the short-term and long-term conditions differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep is one of the most important—but changeable—risk factors for mental illnesses in adolescents and older people,” says Jülich researcher and Privatdozent Dr. Masoud Tahmasian, who coordinated the study. In contrast, long-term pathological sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and short-term sleep deprivation, are located in different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lack of sleep has negative impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerion Reimann, one of the lead authors of the study, who wrote his master’s thesis on this topic at the Jülich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7), says, “The symptoms of sleep deprivation are similar during the day. Anyone who has ever slept poorly or not had enough sleep will know how you often feel a bit grumpy—or unable to perform tasks well due to your attention and reaction times being significantly impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated instances of sleep deprivation can have much more serious consequences. Studies show that frequent sleep deprivation has an adverse effect on brain development, reduces the removal of harmful substances from the brain, decreases emotional stability, and causes a massive decline in working memory as well as a person’s performance at school or at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic sleep disorders and a continual lack of sleep are also risk factors for various mental illnesses,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Different brain structures detected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich researchers analyzed data from 231 brain studies. The studies examined and compared several groups—for example, patients suffering from chronic sleep disorders with healthy individuals, or healthy, well-rested test subjects with those suffering from sleep deprivation. The results show clear neural differences between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with chronic sleep disorders showed changes in a region of the brain known as the “anterior cingulate cortex,” as well as in the right amygdala and in the hippocampus, one of the brain’s central hubs. These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reimann explains, “These abnormalities reflect common symptoms that occur during the day with various sleep disorders, such as exhaustion, memory problems, mood swings, and even depression. Whether the changes in the brain are the cause or a consequence of chronic sleep disorders remains to be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, short-term sleep deprivation was associated with changes in the right thalamus, a brain region responsible for temperature regulation, movement, and the perception of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This corresponds with the symptoms of short-term sleep deprivation,” says Reimann. “You are less attentive, restricted in your actions, and often feel the cold more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Important findings for future studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were thus able to show for the first time that there are no overlapping brain regions between the two groups,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important for future studies. We can now focus on the precise structural and functional regions and networks that are representative of the respective sleep disorder,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individual sleep disorders have previously been considered separately from one another. Now we can also address questions about chronic sleep disorders in transdiagnostic studies—in other words, we can examine several findings at the same time,” adds Tahmasian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings might also pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many patients who suffer from insomnia—or chronic sleep disorders in general—also have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders, as well as Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia,” explains Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know which brain regions are involved, we can investigate in more detail the effects of non-pharmacological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, in comparison to pharmacological treatments for various sleep disorders,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gerion Reimann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gerion Reimann – Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;” by Gerion Reimann et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders have different etiologies yet share some nocturnal and daytime symptoms, suggesting common neurobiological substrates; healthy individuals undergoing experimental sleep deprivation also report analogous daytime symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, brain similarities and differences between long-term sleep disorders and short-term sleep deprivation are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the shared and specific neural correlates across sleep disorders and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Sources&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and BrainMap were searched up to January 2024 to identify relevant structural and functional neuroimaging articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Selection&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain neuroimaging articles reporting voxel-based group differences between patients with different sleep disorders and healthy control participants or between total or partial sleep-deprived and well-rested individuals were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction and Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant coordinates of group comparisons, their contrast direction (eg, patients &amp;lt; controls), and imaging modality were extracted. For each article, 2 raters independently evaluated eligibility and extracted data. Subsequently, several meta-analyses were performed with the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm using &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .05 cluster-level familywise error correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transdiagnostic regional brain alterations were identified across sleep disorders and among articles reporting sleep deprivation. Their associated behavioral functions and task-based or task-free connectivity patterns were explored using 2 independent datasets (BrainMap and the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute–Rockland Sample).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 231 articles (140 unique experiments, 3380 unique participants) were retrieved. The analysis across sleep disorders (n = 95 experiments) identified the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (176 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.86), associated with reward, reasoning, and gustation, and the amygdala and hippocampus (130 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.00), associated with negative emotion processing, memory, and olfaction. Both clusters had positive functional connectivity with the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right thalamus (153 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 5.21) emerged as a consistent regional alteration following sleep deprivation (n = 45 experiments). This cluster was associated with thermoregulation, action, and pain perception and showed positive functional connectivity with subcortical and (pre)motor regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subanalyses regarding the direction of alterations demonstrated that the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited decreased activation, connectivity, and/or volume, while the amygdala and hippocampus cluster and the thalamus cluster demonstrated increased activation,connectivity, and/or volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct convergent brain abnormalities were observed between long-term sleep disorders (probably reflecting shared symptoms) and short-term sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4wTS1zdHF3RUM5cHNFcWdwWjEyTV9od2o3eUJiSnZqS0E3dDF2MHdDSklPWnV2aEpSY3JGQWwxY1U1YjJMMGVSY0N4VjM3ZUhXVUZIR1Y3RVNNTldNM25ncDdCRTlwT2VkLXJrZUp3</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，常见的卫生间错误可能会使您面临致命癌症的风险-每日邮报 | Common bathroom mistake that can put you at risk of deadly cancer, expert warns - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Storing sun cream in the bathroom could make it less effective at guarding against deadly cancer, a doctor has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hot steam from showers and baths can cause the protective ingredients in the cream to break down, meaning the product can fail to prevent dangerous skin damage, according to specialist Dr &lt;span&gt;Ed Robinson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means millions who keep their SPF in bathroom cabinets could be at risk of deadly disease, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both warm temperatures and direct sunlight,' reduce the effectiveness of the sunscreen and leave your skin unprotected,' Dr Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Using degraded SPF means you are not getting the full protection advertised on the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This increases your risk of sunburn, premature ageing, and, more seriously, skin &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8d6b1120-25c3-11f0-82e1-a544321fbb00"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In some cases, broken-down ingredients can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, sun creams should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Millions have been storing their sunscreen all wrong, says aesthetics doctor Ed Robinson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robinson, who runs his own aesthetics practice in Cheshire, urged the public to check their bottles of sunscreen for signs that the active ingredients have degraded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes a change in texture—it could be runnier, lumpier or the formula may have separated. This means it is likely to apply unevenly, leading to 'patchy' protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foul smell or darker, yellowish colour usually means your sunscreen isn’t as able to do its job as it should be, the expert said, adding to always check the expiration date too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He advised to keep the product away from car dashboards and glove boxes, windowsills and bags that are exposed to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the summer months are approaching, slathering on the sunscreen is the best way to avoid skin damage. Experts recommend wearing at least SPF 30 on warm days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most well-known type of harmful sun rays are UVA and UBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UVB rays hit the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and cause the most sunburn, while UVA rays penetrate much deeper and contribute to ageing. Both are ultraviolet, and are known to cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A shocking 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of too much exposure to the sun and sunbeds, according to Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have projected a record high of 20,800 cases last year and there has been a seven per cent rise in the deadly disease in UK adults aged 25-49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, those over the age of 80 have seen a rise of 57 per cent over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exposure to the high humidity and temperature fluctuations can degrade its effectiveness by reducing its SPF protection. A survey found 58 per cent of people forget to protect ‘sun terraces’—areas including the nose, the shoulders and the soles of the feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite increasing awareness of the disease, 45 per cent of people in the UK don’t wear SPF every day, according to an independent YouGov survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of people miss out parts of their body when they apply sun cream, risking sunburn which can lead to skin cancer, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2015 survey found 58 per cent of people forget to protect ‘sun terraces’—areas including the nose, the shoulders and the soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also commonly forget to protect the back of the neck, the ears, and the tops of their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other most frequently missed body parts were the the top of their head, the middle of the back, the toes/feet and the eye lids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the Skin Cancer Foundation warned that a history of five or more sunburns doubles your risk on the deadly skin cancer melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers are now validating the test through multicenter trials to bring it closer to clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; The skin-based PSP assay achieved 90% sensitivity and specificity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The test distinguishes PSP from Parkinson’s and other conditions using skin biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The assay could guide precision treatments once therapies targeting misfolded tau are available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the University Health Network (UHN) and the University of Toronto have developed a skin-based test that can detect signature features of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a rare neurodegenerative disease that affects body movements, including walking, balance and swallowing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, which the researchers describe in a recent issue of &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, could allow for more accurate and faster PSP diagnosis than current methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109358"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/PSP-skin-test-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Using the same technology as the alpha synuclein assay, the team developed a test that could detect a sequence of misfolded tau specific to PSP. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This assay is important for assigning patients to the correct clinical trials, but it will be even more important in the future as researchers develop targeted, precision treatments for PSP,” says Ivan Martinez-Valbuena, a scientific associate at the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre at the UHN’s Krembil Brain Institute and U of T’s Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need diagnostic tools to be developed hand-in-hand with new treatments, so that as these treatments become available, we can identify the patients who would benefit most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In neurodegenerative diseases, misfolded proteins – often alpha synuclein or tau proteins – accumulate in brain and nervous system cells, eventually damaging the cells and causing neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researchers have successfully detected these misfolded proteins in cerebrospinal fluid obtained through a lumbar puncture, the technique is not always accessible and some patients are unable to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, patients are typically diagnosed based on their symptoms and clinical presentation, so some patients may be misdiagnosed – particularly for rarer neurodegenerative diseases such as PSP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could also have a negative impact on research since patients with PSP may be misdiagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and be included in a trial that targets the wrong protein, influencing the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research that led to the PSP breakthrough has roots in an earlier study. In previous research, Martinez-Valbuena and his colleagues developed a test that could detect misfolded alpha synuclein protein in the skin in patients with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have since validated that assay and hope it can be used in clinical trials, although the test is not yet available for clinical diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to extend that test for use in PSP. Using the same technology as the alpha synuclein assay, the team developed a test that could detect a sequence of misfolded tau specific to PSP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Following a meticulous and innovative strategy, Ivan reported for the first time in the literature that disease-associated tau protein can be detected in the skin in living patients with high accuracy,” says Gabor Kovacs, Martinez-Valbuena’s supervisor, a neuropathologist at UHN and a principal investigator at the Tanz Centre who is also a professor of laboratory medicine and pathobiology in U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working collaboratively with colleagues in the Rossy PSP Centre, Martinez-Valbuena, Kovacs and a clinical team led by Anthony Lang – who is director of the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre, the Lily Safra Chair in Movement Disorders at UHN and the Jack Clark Chair for Parkinson’s Disease Research at U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine – were able to access patient samples and validate the new test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined skin biopsies of patients with PSP as well as people with multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Parkinson’s disease and healthy controls, they found misfolded tau in most patients with PSP, but much less frequently in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the misfolded tau protein was not detected in patients with Parkinson’s disease or the healthy controls. Overall, the researchers found that the assay had 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am so delighted to see this exciting development of a new biomarker for this rare neurodegenerative disease, made possible by the close collaboration of world-leading scientists in Toronto,” says Graham Collingridge, senior investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health and director of the Tanz Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez-Valbuena says the test could be incorporated into a panel of blood- and skin-based tests, along with clinical information, to help clinicians make more precise diagnoses and recommend more appropriate clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to pair this skin-based assay together with a patient’s clinical symptoms, and this will give us a much better picture of the patient’s diagnosis,” says Martinez-Valbuena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have precision treatments targeting these misfolded proteins, we will have a better idea of the treatment each patient should receive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now validating the assay in more patients through a clinical trial at five PSP centres in North America and Europe. The Toronto team will continue to study the assay to ensure it is practical and convenient for use outside of major research centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PSP and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/authors-reporters/eileen-hoftyzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Hoftyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Hoftyzer – University of Toronto&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2824066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Four-Repeat Tau Seeding in the Skin of Patients With Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&lt;/a&gt;” by Ivan Martinez-Valbuena et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four-Repeat Tau Seeding in the Skin of Patients With Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of α-synuclein seeding amplification assays (SAA) has provided a new tool to support a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology enables the detection of aggregated forms of α-synuclein (the neuropathologic hallmark of these diseases) in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and in peripheral tissues, such as skin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 12:59:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9Fb3pJUUtUTUtRM2REa0QxWG9QTjZkVkt4QllHNDNJalJkeDRCOGxRbHVrYnV4dEFsVkZvalJ4NWkxYXp1UU5HMEVzbmVMVndGS25MT3p3U2xmcVhmMUJOdl8tMVZhUjRuT0E0</guid></item><item><title>您可以和孩子一起尝试这个快乐的7分钟锻炼-《华盛顿邮报》 | Try this joyful 7-minute workout you can do with kids - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNVVNDaXV2VXJBVHVlRXI5U0dDN01ZR0xMVlhkMmtjTjRqaEFzdzlKaUlIbV9YeEpoN1ZkM0FBUWZRTkd1a2hTdE5Ma1MwNkxmbU9MdS1SV0tzY2hrU0FjN2NqSW96MjlZYnlKRmtYM1ZHVnFSQzVkTWpsY1NGNGRaUTN6RC1Zb2thZnBrWFV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;p id="KCABHNW2KVBK7COBWCUYX5CEBI" data-contentid="KCABHNW2KVBK7COBWCUYX5CEBI" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Here’s an easy way to add fun and fitness to your family life: Invite the kids to spend the next seven minutes with you, scurrying through an imaginary park, ducking branches, dodging lava and crawling like a bear, as part of the new, science-based 7-minute workout with kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5KS2U5IY55GEDHL3GHZQ4PRA4E" data-contentid="5KS2U5IY55GEDHL3GHZQ4PRA4E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;This workout, developed by exercise physiologist Chris Jordan for The Washington Post, with input from his two children, is meant to help combat the growing inactivity of America’s youths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommends a minimum of 60 minutes a day of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/children.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; for young people who don’t have health or disability issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="A2S6SGD6IRFQLDLHFNPTUSZNAE" data-contentid="A2S6SGD6IRFQLDLHFNPTUSZNAE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;But less than a third of children and teens meet that minimum amount, according to the Physical Activity Alliance, a group of academics and policymakers. In its 2024 &lt;a href="https://paamovewithus.org/us-report-card-on-physical-activity-for-children-and-youth/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Report Card on Physical Activity&lt;/a&gt;, the group gave American kids’ current activity levels a D-minus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="SNKBLPJPQBFHFMHMNFJXWNGEOE" data-contentid="SNKBLPJPQBFHFMHMNFJXWNGEOE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Many of their parents wouldn’t score much better. A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/11/5942?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found that parents with young children, especially several young children, generally get less exercise than people without children. There are so many demands, so little time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="QH7LI6BRGRAQ3BHNKYHI3PXKVU" data-contentid="QH7LI6BRGRAQ3BHNKYHI3PXKVU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Which is where the 7-minute workout with kids comes in. Jordan designed it to improve both endurance and muscular strength for adults and children, he said, with exercises alternately focusing on the upper and lower body, as well as the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ID3JHX25YRH7LMTNDIGPQ35UGU" data-contentid="ID3JHX25YRH7LMTNDIGPQ35UGU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;But, above all, he means it to be a blast. “Any physical activity for kids should be fun,” he said — not a chore but a route to joy. So this 7-minute workout involves imagination, as well as exertion. Pretend you and your offspring are sprinting through a park or a lava field or schussing side by side down a snowy ski slope. Customize the workout to your interests and your child’s. Fitness will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="GTHK2OOFMRHSZFHDXHJH2OA6X4" data-contentid="GTHK2OOFMRHSZFHDXHJH2OA6X4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;There’s also no reason grandparents or neighbors can’t recruit their favorite children to do the workout with them. Everyone benefits. “In my experience,” Jordan said, “kids are more likely to engage in and enjoy physical activity if you do it with them,” and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6PTCNK3ASZFBFFCGWAXVT4JFCM" data-contentid="6PTCNK3ASZFBFFCGWAXVT4JFCM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Like all of the 7-minute workout series — the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-low-impact-exercises-modified/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;gentle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-advanced-level-up/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; versions — this routine involves 12 exercises, each done for 30 seconds with a brief break in between. Do it anywhere there’s enough uncluttered space for all of you. You don’t need equipment, and the exercises should be doable for most people of almost any age. But don’t hesitate to start slow and let everyone get familiar with them.

The left bottle is the old packaging; the right is new&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Naturally, it was concerning when the tide seemed to turn about four months ago.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma, a 46-year-old mother of two from Canberra, was one of the people who suspected a change in her child's medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We'd gone through a two-year diagnosis process prior to starting meds for my 10-year-old,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And when she finally began treatment, it was like our prayers had been answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things in our home changed almost overnight, and my daughter experienced what she calls "peaceful brain" for the first time she could remember.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, after about six months of successful treatment, Emma says things started to go awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Her focus and her emotional regulation both began slipping again at the beginning of this year,' says Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At first I put it down to starting a new school year, but I actually feel as though we've seen a backslide in symptoms. So does she.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'The flood of comments has been overwhelming,' explains Jane McFadden, host of the popular ADHD Mums podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The TGA has confirmed supplies of Concerta (methylphenidate hydrochloride) are running low &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma suspects the change could be to do with the efficacy of the Vyvanse her daughter was taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane agrees, believing it's possible the problem could be traced back to last year, when there was a shortage of the drug Australia-wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2023, the medication's sponsor, Takeda Pharmaceuticals Australia, notified the TGA about the limited availability of some strengths due to manufacturing delays and increased demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, the TGA approved the supply of an overseas-registered alternative to Vyvanse 60mg in order to help bridge the gap until supplies returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since this happened, the actual label has changed,' explains Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It looks different, which is fine, but on one strength, the word "pharmaceutical" is actually spelled incorrectly. It doesn't engender a lot of trust.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney woman H.T. (who didn't want her full name published) was so concerned by the change she experienced that she, along with many others, reported her experience to the TGA's adverse events recording system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After initially having great success with Vyvanse, the 31-year-old found that shortly after filling a new script at the start of this year, she began experiencing worrying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had an irregular heartbeat, and started to have random anxiety when it's something I've never suffered with before,' H.T. explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was picking my hair to the point I created bald patches, and I had insomnia so severe that if I couldn't sleep and it was 6am and I needed to be ready for the day, I'd just take my next Vyvanse dose and stay awake all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By the evening I still wasn't sleepy so I would take a sleeping aid. All this was documented with my psychiatrist as I was going through the experience.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being prescribed a number of other medications in order to mitigate the impact, including an antidepressant and sleeping pills, H.T. noticed the spelling error on her new packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went home and compared the two and tried to find information online and there was nothing. That's when I made my first post on a small Facebook group on March 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I asked if anyone had noticed the package change and the spelling errors and then a description of why I was concerned. The amount of comments that were extremely similar to mine confirmed that it wasn't just me, and that it wasn't a placebo effect from seeing the package change, because all my symptoms and concerns were documented with my psychiatrist prior to noticing the packaging change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day H.T. called the TGA and asked if they knew what was going on&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was starting to believe that maybe the new batch was counterfeit,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;H.T. says the TGA informed her they did not have to notify consumers of any packaging change, nor could they confirm if there had been one, though they did say they were investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail Australia has since to spoken to more than 10 women who claim to have experienced adverse effects from the new Vyvanse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A TGA spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia they were aware of a recent increase in reports relating to medicines used to treat ADHD following an uptick in social media commentary, and that an investigation into these concerns is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that minor labelling errors have been identified and are in the process of being corrected. The TGA published information about a Product Alert for this issue on April 3, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone can submit a report about any problems associated with a medicine (including labelling errors),' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Information about how to do this is on our website. We also urge patients and families who are concerned about these issues to speak with their health professionals for advice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Jane, the potential complications she is hearing about are part of a wider issue with ADHD medication in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ongoing shortages are impacting families across the country. Methylphenidate hydrochloride (sold as Concerta) is running low, with the TGA confirming limited supply of its 18mg, 27mg, 36mg and 54mg modified-release tablet products until the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now we're in this very confusing space when it comes to how we can all live, work and stay alive, because it seems nearly every stimulant medication used to treat ADHD has either a major issue with it or it is unavailable,' Jane says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of particular concern, she adds, are the parents who have resorted to sourcing the medication without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You have a controlled substance that some mums are now "black-marketing" because they are desperate,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're in school holidays. We've got unmedicated children. We're unmedicated ourselves. We've already been through the long, big journey, and it feels like no one cares.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One dose is 93% effective and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need an additional dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;At current vaccination rates, the model predicts measles could once again become endemic -- constantly present -- in the U.S. with an estimated 851,300 cases over 25 years.

This is lower than the 93.1% seen the previous school year and the 95.2% seen in the 2019 to 2020 school year, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"That result -- that we're already at this tipping point for measles in the U.S. -- was a really striking finding that somewhat surprised us as well," Dr. Nathan Lo, study co-author and an infectious diseases physician at Stanford Medicine, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We continue to see measles outbreaks, but, by doing the study … you start to crystallize that result that even under the current levels of vaccine decline, there is a very feasible scenario where, over time, our country has measles return where it's a common household disease again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, who was not involved in the study, said the findings are a "well-thought-out worst-case scenario."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I'm not entirely sure that would actually happen because … the general level of vaccination remains pretty high, but there are pockets of unvaccinated children, and what you're seeing now is the fact that this virus has been reintroduced several times from other parts of the world," he told ABC News. "I think it's a bit of a worst-case scenario but, as a worst-case scenario, it's scary and, in that sense, reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, the model estimated that just a 5% increase in vaccination would lead to only 5,800 cases over the same 25-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is because when more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most are protected from measles through community immunity, also known as herd immunity, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My hope is that this study can provide that data to parents to say, 'This is the benefit of continuing to vaccinate your child. This is the kind of alternate reality that we're preventing. And yes, the risks aren't here right now, but perhaps not too far off,'" Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schaffner said there are pockets of the U.S. where MMR vaccination rates are 80% or less and vaccination rates would need to increase substantially in those areas to reduce the number of cases long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, "if we increase the level of vaccination by a small amount that would reduce the risk of other small outbreaks here and there," Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study also found that a 50% drop in vaccinations would lead to an estimated 51.2 million cases over 25 years, but Lo thinks that would only occur if there were a large-scale policy change by the Department of Health and Human Services or the CDC to reduce or remove the childhood vaccine recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of Friday, the CDC has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed nearly 900 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in at least 29 states.

                A survey of older Americans found that 79% would want to know if they were in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and 92% said that if diagnosed, they would probably or definitely want to take a drug that could slow down the disease's progression. The results may indicate a recent shift in openness toward Alzheimer's testing and treatment.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Older Americans want to know if they are in the early stages of Alzheimer's and would happily take a blood test to find out, according to a national survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,700 people 45 and older, part of a &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association, found growing interest in testing, diagnosis, and treatment for the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than 7 million people in the United States are now living with Alzheimer's, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among the survey's key findings:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– Nearly four in five respondents (79%) would want to know they had the disease before symptoms began to interfere with their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;– 80% said they would ask a doctor to be tested, rather than waiting for a test to be offered.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;– 91% said they'd want a blood biomarker test, or some other simple test, if one were available. (Most respondents did not know that several blood tests already on the market can indicate the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 92% said that if diagnosed with Alzheimer's, they would probably or definitely want to take a drug that could slow down the disease's progression. (Two recently approved drugs, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/06/1186225580/alzheimers-drug-leqembi-gets-full-fda-approval-medicare-coverage-lecanemab"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt;, can do this for people in the earliest stages.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 58% said they would take an Alzheimer's drug even if it had a moderate or high risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 83% said that, if diagnosed, they would be open to participating in a clinical trial of an experimental treatment to slow or cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 81% expect that in the next decade, treatments will arrive that can halt the progression of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 44% say they are worried that insurance will not cover treatment and care if a test indicates they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A shift in perspective &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The responses show that people are becoming less afraid and more proactive about an Alzheimer's diagnosis, says &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/elizabeth-edgerly" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist who directs community programs for the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the past, Edgerly says her clients would often say, "Well gosh, I wouldn't want to know," or "Why would I want to know?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason for the change may be that it's now easier to find out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just a few years ago, it took a PET scan or spinal tap to confirm the presence of sticky amyloid plaques in the brain, Edgerly says. Now, a simple blood test can often provide the answer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another factor is the arrival of drug treatment for people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, Edgerly says. That gives people another reason to get a diagnosis while they are still capable of making their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While symptoms are still mild, Edgerly says, "they can articulate what they'd like for their future, they can decide whether they want to try treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The arrival of drug treatment has made people living with Alzheimer's more optimistic, says Dr. Nathaniel Chin, a geriatrician at the University of Wisconsin who was not involved in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Even if it doesn't stop the disease in its tracks, it tells people that we're making progress," he says. "They want to know if they potentially could have this therapy or maybe the next therapy or two therapies down the road."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey results reflect changes in the public's attitude toward Alzheimer's that Chin is seeing in his own practice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think people are as fearful as they have been in the past," he says. "I think there's a desire to know what's happening to our bodies."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Patient-driven change&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many doctors, though, remain skeptical about the benefits of testing. Chin says that's in part because they see existing drugs as only marginally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some patients are ahead of their doctors in this regard," he says. "They want this information and they are going to ask about it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Chin offers blood tests to his own patients with cognitive problems. And he expects the tests to become increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that is likely to bring some new challenges, he says. For example, many health professionals are not trained to counsel people who have just learned they have Alzheimer's. And a positive test result in someone's medical record has the potential to jeopardize their job, or health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are protections for people who learn their genetic information," he says, "but as of now there are not protections for people who are learning if you are cognitively unimpaired or cognitively healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now that more people are finding out, he says, it's up to groups including the Alzheimer's Association to push for those protections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A protein-rich breakfast keeps you full, energized and focused all morning long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, many go-to breakfast foods are low in protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our Broccoli, White Bean &amp;amp; Cheese Quiche is packed with protein, fiber and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast sets the tone for your day. But, when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, many breakfast foods like toast, oatmeal and pastries fall short. Prioritizing protein at breakfast can keep you energized and focused throughout the morning and feeling full and satisfied for hours. If you’re working out, it can also promote muscle recovery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What makes protein so effective? For starters, it helps slow down the digestion of carbohydrates, which means more stable energy and fewer midmorning crashes that leave you reaching for another cup of coffee. Research suggests it may also help improve concentration during those first few hours of the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  And—if weight loss is a goal—a high-protein breakfast promotes satiety and may even increase your calorie burn.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of these perks, it makes sense to fill your plate with protein-rich foods first thing in the morning. As beneficial as protein is, it isn’t the only nutrient you should be turning to. “Most people tend to skip breakfast or just focus on one macronutrient,” says &lt;a href="http://www.carolinethomason.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caroline Thomason, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a Washington, D.C.-based registered dietitian and diabetes educator. “But the truth is the ideal breakfast should provide a balanced combination of protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats and fiber.” That’s where our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-white-bean-cheese-quiche-8782525" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Broccoli, White Bean &amp;amp; Cheese Quiche&lt;/a&gt; comes in. This satisfying breakfast hits every mark for a high-protein meal to start your day off right. In addition to 21 grams of protein from eggs, white beans and cheese, it also has a winning combination of nutrients we look for in a high-protein breakfast. And it’s a cinch to prepare.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-this-high-protein-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why We Love This High-Protein Breakfast  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Filled with Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber supports healthy blood sugar and cholesterol levels while also playing a key role in digestive health. However, “many Americans only consume about half their recommended daily fiber, making this breakfast an excellent way to start closing that gap,” says Thomason. This recipe’s white beans and broccoli team up to deliver 4 grams of fiber per serving, or 14% of the recommended 28-gram Daily Value for this underconsumed nutrient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber-heavy beans in this recipe provide another advantage. Research has found that beans’ combination of fiber and plant chemicals called polyphenols promotes a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, helps your good gut bacteria produce health-promoting compounds called short-chain fatty acids that are linked to better immune health and less inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you barely have time to brew your coffee in the morning, you’ll appreciate how easy this breakfast is to prepare ahead of time. Prep it once over the weekend, and you’ll have a high-protein, nutrient-rich breakfast ready for the week, whether you enjoy it at home or bring a slice to work. Another plus: You can freeze this quiche for up to three months. So you’ll always have a quick and healthy morning meal on hand. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Starting your day with vegetables helps you reach the recommended 2 to 3 cups daily without feeling overwhelmed, cramming them in later,” says Thomason. If you’re among the 90% of Americans who don’t meet their daily veggie quota, this breakfast can be a big help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all vegetables offer impressive health benefits, cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, are especially good for you as they’re associated with better heart health and reduced cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Vitamins and Minerals  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe’s mix of eggs, broccoli, beans and dairy packs a powerful punch of vitamins and minerals, explains Thomason. Each serving provides nearly one-quarter of the DV for zinc and calcium, plus 17% of your daily iron and 12% of your day’s magnesium. These nutrients work hard to support a healthy immune system, energy production, bone health and more. Considering that many people, especially women, don’t get enough iron, calcium or magnesium through diet alone, that’s a big plus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re vegetarian, gluten-free or following any eating plan that restricts certain food groups, hitting your nutrition goals can feel tricky. This recipe is meat-free, making it an ideal high-protein breakfast for anyone on a vegetarian diet that includes dairy and eggs. And if you’re gluten-free and find it difficult to get enough fiber, this quiche’s 4 grams of fiber can get your day off to a strong start.

&lt;p&gt;Well, certain types of important doctors that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial confirmed the health benefits of eating walnuts in improving colonic health and for cancer prevention, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://medicine.uconn.edu/"&gt;UConn School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/ellagitannin"&gt;Ellagitannins&lt;/a&gt; in the walnut are importantly providing the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that we’re seeing in patients in our clinical trial research, particularly the gut’s conversion of ellagitannins to a potent anti-inflammatory agent, urolithin A,” said Daniel W. Rosenberg, who leads a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the UConn School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put in everyday language, Rosenberg said, “There are many potential benefits one can get from eating walnuts, with so little downside risk, that just grabbing a handful every day is really something that you can easily do for your long-term health benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg, who has studied walnut properties for more than a decade, serves as the HealthNet Chair in Cancer Biology and is an investigator in the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/molecular-oncology/"&gt;Center for Molecular Oncology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg has also researched the connection between walnut consumption and its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UConn research team’s clinical trial findings show that high levels of urolithin A formation by the gut microbiome from walnut consumption has a positive impact on reducing inflammatory markers across blood, urine, and fecal samples, and may even positively affect the immune cells within colon polyps, according to UConn.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;For the clinical trial, patients between the ages of 40 to 65 years and at an elevated risk for colon cancer, were referred for the study from the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/gastroenterology/#:~:text=The%20Division%20of%20Gastroenterology%20and%20Hepatology%20is%20committed%20to%20current,%2C%20liver%2C%20pancreas%20and%20colon."&gt;Division of Gastroenterology at UConn Health&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Connecticut’s academic medical center, according to UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of 39 enrolled study participants were screened by the clinical research team at UConn John Dempsey Hospital and asked to complete an NIH Food Frequency Questionnaire for analysis by Ock Chun Ph.D., a nutritional epidemiologist in the &lt;a href="https://cahnr.uconn.edu/"&gt;College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; at UConn Storrs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were asked to avoid all ellagitannin-containing foods and beverages for a week to set their urolithin levels at or close to zero before they began consuming ellagitannin-rich walnuts as part of their closely monitored diet, according to a statement from UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the three-week study, all participants received a high-definition colonoscopy done by Drs. John Birk and Haleh Vaziri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the key findings the researchers found that elevated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/"&gt;urolithin A&lt;/a&gt; levels in the urine of patients correlated with the serum levels of peptide YY, a protein that has been associated with inhibition of colorectal cancer. Reduced levels of several inflammation markers present in the blood were also found, especially in obese patients that had the greatest capacity to form urolithins by their gut microbiome, according to a statement from UConn.&lt;/p&gt;

Jan. 7, 2023 (Tina Encarnacion/UConn Health Photo) (Tina Encarnacion/UConn Health Photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg also used high-dimensional spatial imaging technology that allowed UConn researchers to develop a detailed view of cellular interactions present inside colon polyps that were removed during colonoscopy at the end of the walnut study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging technology revealed that patients with high levels of urolithin A formation following walnut consumption was associated with reduced levels of several important proteins that are often present in polyps, showing for the first time how walnut ingestion may enhance colon health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that the protein vimentin, often associated with more advanced forms of colon cancer, was greatly reduced inside polyp tissues obtained from patients who had also formed the highest levels of urolithin A by their gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings build upon the earlier work of Dr. Masako Nakanishi, an assistant professor in the Rosenberg Lab, who showed in several earlier publications that walnuts had beneficial and anti-cancer effects in the colons of cancer-prone mice, key findings that prompted the current clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A has a very positive influence on inflammation and maybe even cancer prevention,” Rosenberg said. “Our study proves that dietary supplementation with walnuts can boost the general population’s urolithin levels in those people with the right microbiome, while significantly reducing several inflammatory markers, especially in obese patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg said the study provides strong rationale for dietary inclusion of walnut ellagitannins for cancer prevention.&lt;br&gt;
The research was supported by awards from the American Institute for Cancer Research, the &lt;a href="https://walnuts.org/about-us/california-walnut-commission/"&gt;California Walnut Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

High cholesterol has often been called a ‘silent killer’ because people often don’t realise they’ve got a problem until a serious health issue arises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apart from some rare symptoms the only way to detect it is a blood test - but it leads to the clogging of blood vessels and arteries leading to high blood pressure and increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study by researchers in the Penn State Department of Nutritional Sciences published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000577" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; just revealed that eating 57 grams of pecans per day, which is about two medium handfuls, could help lower cholesterol. The randomised trial included 138 participants — who all had at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat, and abnormal cholesterol levels — and divided them into two groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One group was asked to eat 57 grams of raw, unsalted pecans each day in place of the snacks they usually consumed, while the control set continued eating its typical diet. After 12 weeks, researchers found that “Pecan intake improved total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the usual diet group.” This translated to a reduction in total cholesterol by 8.1 milligrams per deciliter, or 3.6%.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kristina Petersen, associate professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State and co-author of the study said: “Replacing typical snacks with pecans improved key risk factors for heart disease including blood cholesterol levels and diet quality,” said. “These results add to the large evidence-base supporting the cardiovascular benefits of nuts and add additional insights into how adults can incorporate nuts into their diet to improve the overall quality of their diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brett Victor, MD, a cardiologist at Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia said: “The study found statistically significant improvements in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, but it’s difficult to know how much of this benefit was due to the pecans themselves as opposed to the reduction of other, likely less healthy, snacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would interpret this trial as confirmation that replacing unhealthy snacks with a modest amount of healthy snacks, including nuts and pecans if you enjoy them, is one way to promote a heart-healthy diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What did the study find:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the study, pecan snackers experienced reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and triglycerides compared to non-pecan snackers. LDL cholesterol can build up in arteries and increase the risk of stroke or heart attack. HDL — sometimes known as “good cholesterol” — carries cholesterol back to the liver for removal from the body. So, both lowering LDL and reducing the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL can reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease. Triglycerides are a necessary lipid for energy storage and metabolism, but high levels of triglycerides also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Participants may have helped by being healthier&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said people should consider consuming more foods with polyphenols — like pecans, fruits, vegetables and whole grains — to support heart health and improve overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Peterson said: “The improved diet quality among pecan snackers — including a higher percentage of calories from polyunsaturated fats and increased fiber and polyphenols — likely also contributed to the observed cholesterol improvements, particularly the LDL-lowering effects.” The researchers said that replacing a person’s usual snacks with pecans each day could improve cholesterol levels and diet quality, especially if they are at risk of metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Pecan Nutrition&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pecans are rich in many vitamins and minerals important for healthy skin, eyes, teeth, bones, muscles, and nerves. Pecans are a good source of calcium, magnesium, and potassium, which help lower blood pressure. Vitamin A&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Folate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Niacin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Riboflavin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Thiamine&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vitamin B6&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Vitamin E&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Calcium&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Iron&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Magnesium&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Manganese&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Zinc&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 06:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQOFBuYTNtRXlUZ2hWcDNrV200bi1kYXJLbTU3OWNKMWJaY0hySmtoODFhQXBybm9UdE9hWVMyWHpVYndsTDZYSEw1SlpNTjZVdDJiVmNvYVktZW5xSHBvQzJZanFZN2h6LTdtZ21aZG1hX01jY0hmVm9GY2ppZU9tZDZ4a1dsZHQ1QjFV</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：连续两位医生转向礼宾诊所-底特律新闻 | Dr. Roach: Two doctors in a row switch to a concierge practice - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxPTzVzOV9UaFB2Z0JlNVU0eFRfS3pLLXR5dFdmSWtfX1dMVk9CU2xXQno5V0tYLVpRMU5IWmVzbktORDMwY1JGUDhVR29KXzl0Mm1SRm5Yb0c1TGZuajJsaG5QSWRqSEtjaXRpVy0yVEw3aE9qTjFEbHZHLUtZcm9TX0hGaDVkX19KVFRCWnFvckdoTVlnWkkwOVFzTnV2M1JFS3Y2NzZIUWV4ZFhCRE55Z2Y5OGV4eTRUeUs1SEpzNEpoNko1NVFLVzVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Two years ago, my doctor (whose patient I had been for many years) decided to switch to a concierge practice. He charged $2,000 annually per patient. Neither my husband nor I chose to participate. We found a new doctor who we have been very happy with for the past two years. Now he has decided to go concierge as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He is charging $2,000 annually or offering patients who do not wish to participate in a concierge practice an opportunity to pay an "administrative" fee of $500 annually to continue as one of his patients. Both my husband and I have very good insurance that covers 100% of our medical costs, and I saw my doctor three times last year. I told him that paying an additional payment of over $150 per visit is ridiculous. So, once again, we are looking for another physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This appears to be occurring quite often in my area. My question to you is, do you think this is right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— P.E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear P.E.:&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, concierge medicine can be done ethically, but I have real questions about the way your physician is moving to a concierge or "retainer" medicine practice. If a physician chooses to move to a concierge model, which by itself is not unethical, they ought to help their existing patients find care and aid with the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I don't agree with the $500 "administrative fee" per year, which sounds like a charge solely to remain as his patient and get no additional service. I understand the benefits of a concierge practice to a physician, and for those who can afford it, there are advantages for the patient, too. But it is my personal opinion that we physicians have an obligation to provide care. I have known concierge physicians who volunteer at free clinics as a way of fulfilling their professional obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I first heard about a disease called "sweating sickness" while watching a television series. Do people still get sweating sickness under a different name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— J.S.B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear J.S.B.:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweating sickness was a disease that was found in England between 1485-1581 but wasn't seen again. The major symptoms were a rapid onset of a high fever with sweating, then death following in hours or days. The details of the described cases at the time have led medical historians to suspect that the disease was a very dangerous virus such as a hantavirus, which causes a hemorrhagic fever in Europe and Asia and a heart/lung syndrome in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hantaviruses normally exist in rodents but can occasionally cross over into humans. Less than 1,000 cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome have been reported in the United States as of 2021, but a prominent actor's wife recently died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other authorities suspect that sweating sickness was caused by an enterovirus (a large family of viruses that is responsible for many diseases, including polio), which is the suspected cause in a condition called acute flaccid myelitis. But we can only guess at the cause of this mysterious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Highly virulent germs (those that kill their hosts) often die out quickly as they kill their hosts before many people get infected. However, some diseases become less virulent over time since the germs that don't kill people have more time to quickly spread to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Syphilis, for example, was a rapidly fatal disease in Europe during the 16th century, but by the 18th century, it had become a much more indolent disease. (Though, of course, it's still dangerous and should be avoided.) The main barrier to syphilis treatment now is getting people diagnosed. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 03:33:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxPTzVzOV9UaFB2Z0JlNVU0eFRfS3pLLXR5dFdmSWtfX1dMVk9CU2xXQno5V0tYLVpRMU5IWmVzbktORDMwY1JGUDhVR29KXzl0Mm1SRm5Yb0c1TGZuajJsaG5QSWRqSEtjaXRpVy0yVEw3aE9qTjFEbHZHLUtZcm9TX0hGaDVkX19KVFRCWnFvckdoTVlnWkkwOVFzTnV2M1JFS3Y2NzZIUWV4ZFhCRE55Z2Y5OGV4eTRUeUs1SEpzNEpoNko1NVFLVzVn</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.告诉新父母“自己做疫苗研究” - HuffPost | RFK Jr. Tells New Parents To 'Do Your Own Research' On Vaccines - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQazIyd2NYMkt5Y3p0M1M2QzFMTG1mbTNOT1ZPTExVeXNQbFd3SWlpWkJpYV9KUEY3UTVwcjNEOEFaa20zS1YxM2F1NlpPblBhd05RcVI3cWhQQlJWbzVBQkVkWWxVT2EzNEczZUpTenQzTXpkOXpiT0x4dnhFN294cFhPRFIxMzR6bW9ScWFncDZUV1dNQ29Pc1FB0gGfAUFVX3lxTFBoME5zMDVsRHo3R3JxMS1uVEhkMkViRXFBVTdLMXZOWWZFSnFrS0FISnlvdFF5VFFvT1ZOeHpHaDM1WjUtbUFkUms3bzE1YThfelpiT1AwUEdXQVk0VDg0NXR6WGFQNW1OVk5yTlBNWTRBWEV1OEhKQ0hETVZNR3RHTWNsR0VWWjdUTU93OG95SVpsbkpQXzZ5ek1XVWp1aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite leading the government department tasked with advising Americans on their health and safety, Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;Experts say to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/11/lifestyle/heres-the-disgusting-reason-why-you-should-never-wear-new-clothes-without-washing-them/"&gt;wash newly bought clothes&lt;/a&gt; before wearing them — especially if they’re from a second-hand store. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this one poor soul learned this lesson the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Jam Press, a TikToker (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onenevertwoo_one" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@‌onenevertwhoo_one&lt;/a&gt;) who preferred to only be referred to by his social media name, contracted a skin infection most likely due to his never-washed thrifted clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained in a now-viral video that he contracted molluscum contagiosum, a viral skin infection that consists of small, raised bumps on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite looking painful, apparently the condition is harmless and does not require treatment, according to NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Although this skin disease is often spread through skin-to-skin or sexual contact, the TikToker blames his unwashed thrifted clothes for his welts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content creator’s assumption might be accurate because, according to &lt;a href="https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/fhk2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frances Kozen, &lt;/a&gt;a Cornell University senior lecturer in fiber science and apparel design, garments often are treated with a fabric softener, a stain-resistant or water-repellent coating, or an anti-mildew agent that can cause irritation, redness or itching, she &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/wash-new-clothes-before-wearing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told Self magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His vulnerable video received millions of views and thousands of comments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some empathised with him: “I hope you get well soon and are as healthy as before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And others were confused about how he made this mistake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you wash your clothes first?” a commenter asked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New fear unlocked,” another person chimed in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More shocked because just found out someone bought clothes not washed,” someone else wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/pdfs/Unravelling-Harms-of-Fast-Fashion-Full-Report-2023-02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;They have things on them&lt;/a&gt; that you don’t want on your skin,” he said in the video. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that molluscum contagiosum is not the only skin condition someone can become infected with if they wear clothes straight from a store or online. People also put themselves at risk of contracting ringworm if they don’t listen to the experts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ringworm-body/symptoms-causes/syc-20353780" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, ringworm, which affects the outer layer of the skin, is itchy, scaly and contagious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Ringworm] can spread through clothing, towels, and bedding that [has] not been disinfected after use by someone with [ringworm],” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ringworm/hcp/clinician-brief-resistant-infections/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;advised the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; in a report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if someone is trying on clothes at a store and has ringworm, and you buy those same clothes and don’t wash them first — you’re at risk of also getting the skin condition.&lt;/p&gt;

officials in Texas said the child had not had underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An unvaccinated child, aged six, also with no underlying conditions, died of measles in Texas in late February, Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers have warned that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter-century after the disease was declared eradicated from the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The rate of rise in measles cases appears to be slowing down, but it is still concerning that we are seeing more cases adding to the count,” said Sapna Singh, chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New Mexico’s health department reported 66 cases on Tuesday, the same as its last update. Most of the state’s cases are from Lea county, adjacent to Gaines county in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The ideal situation is to see a few weeks of no increase in the case count before we can have some optimism in the spread slowing down,” said Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Doctors assert that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The disease has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other states with active outbreaks – defined as three or more cases – include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the US is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates – above 95% – diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their children from required shots. The US saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5BWU13ZUxRV0xBSjJxTE9CbEw3dHRKZjFvUzVjaGt4QXduWUZLOEhtLVNvOXRDODhoYTd0Z1Y0WlB1a3RTWjBlSk5zRWtMeUp6WmJna2VKcnBNdmFZeU1OVFhLZC0wTGFsa3RVV2NEX3R1dWN2bUE</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么有些人会食物中毒而其他人不会- BuzzFeed | So THAT'S Why Some People Get Food Poisoning And Others Don't - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5PYlU2T3BMR2luRk9RZExCaU9LOVQ0dks5Q0k0NTJnUFEwb19NeG9oR3pSNHpGQ3NxemxWMGprbE02aVhOS0c2cHBaMnJjTkVCNmFydkFnVk1HVHpLZ2dXbFl6aEo3LXdQTEQ4ODZkQkRxcm95WVJiOHdpa3lqZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, your body may not be able to fight off food poisoning. Every single person is completely different in a multitude of ways, including their immune system and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868939" data-affiliate="true"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, the home of trillions of microorganisms that can influence your digestive system and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to food poisoning, it completely disrupts your gut microbiome, which is why you feel so sick. If you and your friend eat the same undercooked hamburger and you have an unhealthy microbiome while they have a healthier one, you may experience a bit of an upset stomach afterward.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person with an inadequate microbiome will experience food poisoning more often,” Mazur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fuel your body with healthy foods, your microbiome will thrive. If you don’t, your gut microbiome may not be able to fight off bacteria from the undercooked or raw food that gave you food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazur said the characteristics of an inadequate microbiome are a lack of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity, as well as high concentrations of pathogenic bacteria, which is a significant risk factor for frequent bouts of food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted two other things that can affect whether someone gets sick or not: if they ate enough of the food to become infected, and what else they ate or drank that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you started the day drinking alcohol heavily, you’ve already damaged your healthy microbiome for the day, making you more susceptible on that specific day,” Mazur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your diet plays a part in how healthy your gut microbiome is. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

At one point she even considered having her eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was only after Ellie was offered a "last resort" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's been transformative," Ellie told the BBC. "I feel so fortunate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a "breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was completely dominating my life," Ellie says. "I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor.

"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says she eventually reached "breaking point", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying," she says, "my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin A close-up of Ellie's right eye which shows a cataract - a cloudy light blue circle in the centre of the eye - which causes blurry vision" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Ellie's eye developed a cataract that had to be removed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one," she says. "So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Brown says metagenomics is "an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin Ellie and friends swimming in the Amazon river, with their heads above the surface and the sun rising behind the trees in the background." class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Doctors believe Ellie's eye condition was caused by an infection she caught while swimming in the Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I broke down - I just had to cry.

To gather data on chimpanzees, which are some of our closest animal relatives, researchers observed five captive chimps at the Kumamoto Sanctuary of the Kyoto University Wildlife Research Center, which houses animals formerly used in pharmaceutical research.

The authors, a group of researchers at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, estimated that roughly 13 percent of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide that year could be attributed to phthalates, which are used in food packaging, shampoo, toys and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on the effect of phthalates on cardiovascular disease is still emerging, but their link to metabolic risk factors like obesity suggest they could play a role in heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt; While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they cautioned that the study relied on complex statistical modeling and a series of assumptions and estimates that make it difficult to determine how many deaths might be linked to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is an early step of trying to understand the magnitude of the problem,” said Dr. Mark Huffman, a cardiologist and a co-director of the global health center at WashU Medicine in St. Louis. But, he added, there’s a need for far more studies to understand the relationship between phthalates and heart health, and what other factors might come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="css-15h6bi9 e1gnsphs0" id="link-7101f615"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Phthalates are found in personal care products like shampoos and lotions, as well as in food containers and packaging. It’s possible to ingest them through food, absorb them through the skin from products containing them or breathe them in as dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The review of pooled data analyses of randomised controlled trial results published between 2012 and 2024 suggests that exercise can significantly reduce side-effects associated with treatment for cancer, such as heart and nerve damage and brain fog. Before this study, no such comprehensive evaluation had been published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise also seems to boost psychological wellbeing and overall quality of life, lending weight to its routine inclusion in treatment protocols for the disease, the study’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109392" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The findings of the review&lt;/a&gt;, led by Shengjing hospital of China Medical University, were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. It included 485 associations from 80 articles, all evaluated as being of moderate to high quality. Types of exercise studied included aerobic and resistance exercise, high-intensity interval training, tai chi and yoga, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise significantly reduced various side-effects associated with cancer and its treatment compared with usual care or no exercise, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It lessened heart and peripheral nerve damage associated with chemotherapy, brain fog (cognitive impairment) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It also changed body composition and key physiological indicators of health, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and C-reactive protein in people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise also improved sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, the normal workings of the body and social interaction, while boosting overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There was evidence of high to moderate certainty that preoperative exercise reduced the risk of postoperative complications, pain, length of hospital stay, and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In conclusion, this study reinforces the efficacy of incorporating exercise into cancer treatment protocols,” &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109392" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Moderate- to high-certainty evidence showed that exercise, compared with usual care or no exercise, significantly reduced cancer-related adverse events, improved body composition and biomarkers, enhanced sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, physical function, social interaction and overall QoL [quality of life].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Celene Doherty, a specialist cancer information nurse at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, who was not involved with the study, said it provided further evidence that exercise could help reduce side effects from cancer treatment and improve long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, cancer patients go through a lot when they are diagnosed, and focusing on lifestyle changes like being more active might sound overwhelming,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s important to take things at your own pace and do activities that are right for you.” She said patients who would like advice or support on their situation should speak to their cancer team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNYTQ1M1hPdjZlNWgtZVRkb2Z5VmJBNXAyWGxNbTdaUGJNV2JfU3ZIOWVLRW5GYXdpcEtaZWZMbFpvZDFNOUNobGhyanhwTzFhREtrWTFWTHRVM0RpS0JuS3VMOHZjUjVJcDdfX0JEUE9raVpLNGNqMjRZTXpNWVA3RTJ4b09aZjBFLWM1cWlxbVRpS3h5TUhoelFDODJ2T20yY3hLc0thRWNtSC1fQnpibF9QUXN1eTgyWFotRDBmdXRnaDYxZ081ZDhWS0dIUDg</guid></item><item><title>小RFK在访问德克萨斯州时表示，自闭症、糖尿病比麻疹更值得关注-德克萨斯论坛报 | In visit to Texas, RFK Jr. said autism, diabetes deserve more attention than measles - The Texas Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVU8zcmZ4SVBaSVVMVXRPSnNqOVRkbl9hXzhpOE8tSHVWWnY2Z3dTRHRhQnU1UDNzdEZXdTBBVUJLOGY5eVViZXNDaWdVZXJVRzBiMHVXbzRNLUtrb3pZTEtPNVlvcjVLUHc2MzE1Vmp2Mm44VVpMMVFmckZfNHllV0VR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-story-body"&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a visit to Texas on Tuesday that measles deserves less attention than other chronic diseases, while downplaying the number of deaths that have occurred in the state’s historic outbreak of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During a visit to Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station, Kennedy said that Europe’s measles deaths are higher than the U.S.’ “four deaths in 20 years,” two of whom were Texas children this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He also said more attention should be focused on chronic conditions like diabetes, as well as autism, which Kennedy has previously linked to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The scientific community has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768751/"&gt;widely debunked the theory&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the vaccine does not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/time&gt;
    
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Every child who gets measles gets a headline,” Kennedy said during the visit alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. “When I was kid, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Pre%2Dvaccine%20era&amp;amp;text=A%20vaccine%20became%20available%20in,States%20were%20infected%20each%20year"&gt;2 million measles cases&lt;/a&gt; a year and nobody wrote about them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Over the last few months, Kennedy has been criticized for his response to the measles outbreak, which has been largely centered in Texas. He has questioned the role measles had in the deaths of three individuals confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control this year. He has praised private medical providers who have used alternative treatment methods on measles patients, to ease some symptoms including vitamin A and budesonide, an inhaled steroid typically used for asthma but does not “cure” measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health officials have repeatedly said that two doses of the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He stressed on Tuesday that his agency has to take care of Texans who want to vaccinate, but also Texans who do not.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have to talk to those people, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy stressed the federal support he’s sending to Texas, which has footed the bill so far to try to contain the outbreak through testing and vaccination. So far, the effort has cost the state more than $4.5 million since the first case was detected in late January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re working very closely with the governor of Texas with the public health officials in Texas. We’ve provided them enormous support from the CDC, all the support that they’ve requested for vaccines and for alternative medicine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He also struck an optimistic note about the state of Texas’ outbreak. He said measles cases are slowing as officials are doing well to manage the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While Tuesday’s state measles update shows the number of cases slowing in Gaines County, the heart of the outbreak, areas new to the outbreak, such as El Paso, are showing a faster rise in cases. On Tuesday, El Paso had 11 new cases, a 45% increase since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas health officials were more cautious about whether this slowing of infections could be maintained. On Tuesday the number of measles cases in Texas had risen to 663 cases in 26 counties. Of those, 87 patients had been hospitalized and two school-aged children have died since the outbreak began in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;"It’s too soon to say. We can really only see trends looking backwards. We’d need to see a few weeks of decline to say that it was trending downward,” said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “There was a lot of travel for the Easter holiday so we’re watching to see if there is an increase in cases over the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Houston’s Baylor College of Medicine and vocal vaccine proponent, said work remains to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The numbers are still going up,” Hotez said. “This is not a time to take your foot off the gas.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Rollins said she invited Kennedy to her alma mater to see Texas A&amp;amp;M’s research, as the two agencies work on the upcoming five-year Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The report, which both secretaries said would come out this summer, is expected to be a rejection of the latest 453-page advisory report, completed under the Biden Administration, that typically informs policies on healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Traditionally, the dietary guidelines have been a political document,” Kennedy said. “Today, we’re changing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the event, Rollins ticked off Americans’ poor health metrics, including how about&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html"&gt; 100 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are obese and the rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other diet-related diseases on the rise. She also announced a second round of funding for USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/programs/marketing-assistance-specialty-crops-masc"&gt;marketing assistance for specialty crops program&lt;/a&gt;. A total of $1.3 billion is being made available to farmers who grow specialty items including fruits, vegetables, vegetable seed, mushrooms, tree nuts, nursery crops, Christmas trees and culinary and medicinal herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy complimented A&amp;amp;M’s commitment to providing better nutrition to the American people, after making several tour stops on the campus including a sorghum greenhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“No longer will taxpayers pay for junk food and sugary drinks for our SNAP recipients. When we talk about chronic obesity and chronic disease, especially amongst our youth and our adolescents, it hits the hardest with those who are the most food challenged,” Rollins said.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says these online influencers advocating a cortisol detox are “hijacking attention” using a medicalised name to give themselves an air of legitimacy that can translate to followers, engagement, money and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It sounds like an easy fix to whatever issues might be happening in your life to target one particular chemical [but] the framing of this as a dangerous chemical is really problematic because it’s necessary,” Dober says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-cortisol-and-can-you-have-too-much-of-it" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is cortisol and can you have too much of it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone, produced by the adrenal glands, and your body usually produces the right amount of cortisol to keep you healthy. Prof Creswell Eastman, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, says cortisol is an “essential hormone for life” which regulates blood pressure and the metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cortisol levels do increase with everyday stresses – and cause blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar levels to rise with them – but that process is actually protective to help you solve problems and overcome that source of stress, Eastman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s our physiological response to the flight and fight mechanism, ensuring that we can survive some threat to our wellbeing. That’s why we make cortisol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If someone’s adrenal glands were to be taken out and they were no longer able to produce the cortisol hormone, when they were confronted with a stress they would not be able to respond to it, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The only people who have too much cortisol have the rare Cushing’s disease – when the body makes too much cortisol – or Cushing’s syndrome, which occurs when a person takes too many &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/the-role-of-cortisol-in-the-body#medicines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;medicines that are similar to cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, Eastman says. “There’s no way you can detox from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no such thing as detoxing from cortisol excess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="isnt-stress-bad" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Isn’t stress bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says “we need a healthy ‘Goldilocks’ amount of stress to thrive and grow and to learn. As humans, we don’t want to have no stress in our lives. It’s not realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Chronic stress, which lasts longer than three months, does &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/01/the-chronic-stress-survival-guide-how-to-live-with-the-anxiety-and-grief-you-cant-escape" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;impact health, wellbeing and immune system&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress management should be part of people’s everyday self-care, but Dober says the focus on the cortisol levels themselves is unhelpful and there are no ways to quantify them for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She warns some “cortisol detox” tips being given could be harmful, especially when it is assumed the tips will work for everyone. As just one example: cold plunges or cold water immersion therapy can be dangerous for those with pre-existing heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-experts-recommend-instead" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do experts recommend instead?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Karena Burke, the head of the school of psychology at the University of Wollongong, says “just focusing on cortisol reduction can be problematic, and not having enough is just as problematic as having too much”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are aspects of the ‘detox’ process that is really great advice, but honestly the focus people should have is on changes to their lifestyle overall and sustaining those changes over time,” Burke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is possible to ‘feel better’ after two to three weeks on these sorts of programs, but that’s because they also focus on dietary changes, stress management techniques and factors like reducing alcohol, spending time outside in nature and on increasing social connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If someone is feeling that they are constantly stressed, they can try techniques such as relaxation, deep breathing and journalling, or increasing their physical activity – walking outside or along the beach is just as good as going to the gym – and working on their sleep hygiene, Burke recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is important to consult a doctor, counsellor, psychologist or another healthcare professional, especially if someone is feeling really stressed or if they are planning major lifestyle changes (including dietary changes). A professional can assist to monitor the impacts and adaptations taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Burke says: “We’ve all heard it before, but there are few (if any) quick fixes, and there needs to be an individualised approach taken – that may mean experimenting with different things to see what works best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says if people have genuine concerns around their cortisol levels, they should see their GP or an endocrinologist, but if we are thinking about general life stress, “trying to learn how to best manage stress at different points of your life can be very, very helpful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c92b9cce-2120-4a3c-9557-68025e8615b2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Ask Antiviral","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"c92b9cce-2120-4a3c-9557-68025e8615b2","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

In a two-session study, participants consistently reported more intense pain when they expected worse outcomes, while the benefits of expecting relief were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects persisted even a week later, suggesting that the brain may be wired to prioritize perceived threats. The findings emphasize the importance of avoiding negative framing in clinical settings, as patient expectations significantly shape treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; How healthcare providers communicate can shape patient outcomes through expectation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger Nocebo Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Negative expectations increased perceived pain more than positive ones reduced it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Nocebo effects persisted a week later, outlasting placebo responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative expectations can worsen perceived pain more strongly – and for longer – than positive expectations can make it feel better, according to new research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published recently as a Reviewed Preprint in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, is described by the editors as valuable, with the potential for a significant impact in the field of experimental and clinical pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the authors’ rigorous methodology to compare the magnitude and duration of placebo and nocebo effects in pain perception yields compelling evidence that nocebo responses demonstrate consistently greater strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo and nocebo effects refer to the power of expectation in shaping how we experience symptoms. A placebo effect occurs when a person feels better simply because they believe a treatment will help, even if it is inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a nocebo effect is when someone feels worse because they expect a negative outcome, even without a physical cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While many studies have explored placebo and nocebo effects individually, few have directly compared the two in the same people over time,” says co-lead author Katharina Schmidt, a senior postdoc at the Department of Neurology, Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We set out to determine whether negative expectations towards treatment have a stronger or longer-lasting effect on pain perception than positive ones. This is important because in clinical settings, both types of expectations can be triggered by how doctors and nurses communicate – and potentially shape patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schmidt served as lead author of the study alongside Angelika Kunkel, also a postdoc at C-TNBS, University Duisburg-Essen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess and compare placebo and nocebo effects, the team studied 104 healthy volunteers across two sessions one week apart. On the first day, participants were exposed to short bursts of heat pain after being led to expect either pain relief (placebo), increased pain (nocebo), or no change (control).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These expectations were created using a combination of verbal suggestions and a fake pain relief treatment – a sham nerve stimulation device that appeared real but delivered no actual relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their pain on a scale between 0 (not painful at all) and 100 (unbearably painful).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to participants, the researchers subtly adjusted the heat stimulus to reinforce their expectations – making it less painful in the placebo condition and more painful in the nocebo condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second session, the pain stimulus was kept identical across all conditions, allowing the team to test whether expectations formed on the first day continued to shape participants’ pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that both placebo and nocebo suggestions significantly influenced pain perception – but the nocebo effect was stronger. On the first day, participants in the nocebo condition rated their pain on average 11.3 points higher than the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas in the placebo condition, participants rated their pain only 4.2 lower than the control. When participants returned one week later for the second session, these patterns persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nocebo effect remained stronger than the placebo effect: participants in the nocebo condition  reported pain ratings 8.9 points higher than the control, whereas the placebo effect was again more modest, with pain ratings just 4.6 points lower than the control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that people are more likely to expect and feel worse outcomes than better ones,” says Schmidt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It reflects a ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy – humans may have evolved to be more attuned to potential threats, making negative expectations carry more weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that recent experience of pain had a greater impact on participants’ future responses than verbal suggestions alone. For example, those who experienced a strong placebo or nocebo effect on the first day were more likely to show the same response a week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological traits played a role too: people who tend to feel normal body sensations as stronger and more uncomfortable showed weaker placebo effects, while those who rated the experimenter as highly competent were more susceptible to nocebo effects – possibly because they found the negative suggestions more believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that the study was conducted using experimental pain in healthy volunteers. Further research is needed to determine how these effects apply in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the enduring nature of both placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses showing consistently greater strength over time,” says senior author Ulrike Bingel, Director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Pain Medicine and Translational Pain Research at the Department of Neurology, C-TNBS, University Duisburg-Essen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we often focus on boosting positive expectations in patients, we show that it may be just as important – if not more so – to avoid unintentionally creating negative ones, which appear to be more easily triggered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nocebo effects can be prevented using simple, effective strategies to improve communication between patients and practitioners,” adds Bingel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Positive framing, avoiding unnecessary emphasis on side effects, and building a trusting relationship can all reduce the risk of triggering nocebo responses. In a time when cost-effectiveness in healthcare is essential, preventing nocebo effects should be a key strategy for improving treatment outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was conducted as part of the Collaborative Research Center “Treatment Expectation,” funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c78eccc9d4c3c8c6c9c5ccc4e0c5ccc9c6c5d3c3c9c5cec3c5d38ecfd2c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;George Litchfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;George Litchfield – eLife&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.105753.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects in healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;” by Katharina Schmidt et al. &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects in healthy individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo and nocebo effects illustrate the profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this preregistered study, we used a within-subject design in 104 healthy to investigate and directly compare the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a one-week follow-up. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained effects after one week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:28:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFAxYkhTUUVUTVQwVVZtSU9xRllYNTAzZmJEVndHb1dtc2NpN2RBU2l3WFliRnVHQzlTNUxLWjJwZHQ3SkliUl9saUlXa3hKMERtR3VfTkxTWVZmZG5GeXlSWFgtWmFGRzRKdU40dXZiSVFoRUF0ckcw</guid></item><item><title>州卫生部门称，德克萨斯州的麻疹病例上升至663例-路透社 | Measles cases in Texas rise to 663, state health department says - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQMTMzTFBaYjc3d3lST0NWNWNJcjZHWXd0STAzSmRuSlREbG03bXBLQ1FiaklIYmc5eGVmZk9CM3luWHRZbGR6MzdkZTdZeXZ2WTlyc0N0YWY0aEs1WDNYMFljU2VhTDNSTWpzNm03SnZVZ2xMMUM4a0pfd0tEQ0FYRXFUVlFuRTVlbVlUNk14RWQzMnVCSXRLNUg1T1Q5SWVyQV9SdUtOZmV6dm1DYXlWVU5fLWRDOTcxRmRWNkRLV1VBdE5ZY0Nraw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQMTMzTFBaYjc3d3lST0NWNWNJcjZHWXd0STAzSmRuSlREbG03bXBLQ1FiaklIYmc5eGVmZk9CM3luWHRZbGR6MzdkZTdZeXZ2WTlyc0N0YWY0aEs1WDNYMFljU2VhTDNSTWpzNm03SnZVZ2xMMUM4a0pfd0tEQ0FYRXFUVlFuRTVlbVlUNk14RWQzMnVCSXRLNUg1T1Q5SWVyQV9SdUtOZmV6dm1DYXlWVU5fLWRDOTcxRmRWNkRLV1VBdE5ZY0Nraw</guid></item><item><title>36岁的女性，新基因编辑疗法后第4期结肠癌治愈- today.com | Woman, 36, With Stage 4 Colon Cancer Cured After New Gene-Editing Therapy - today.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNMlFRa2NVTkRxR2ZpOF9oR29NcDluM29oeEJkSkdqa0w4ajczUGdSUWZBNjNwOGo0aXEtRkY2WmM4VzdtcURjNUx1SFJsNmZrSWRuUThZZHBtQWFhSDJsaHpOejZCQnJXYVJsWDZyc0dzSndqblVDQmRJTjB2NmhBN2xQcUlEcWdIODlJ0gFUQVVfeXFMUHllQklhOV95ODBEQVdsTXlIV3R6UjZLWjFXNktoVVFhOFZUeFBQSTdEUnU0Ni1nWFNsMlhLQngtOTNqMGxNWW9EOE9MMVZoOGo4THgy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During Thanksgiving 2013, Emma Weston, then 23, experienced intense stomach cramps. After a blood test during her annual physical uncovered low hemoglobin levels, she underwent numerous tests and learned she had Stage 3 colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They found a softball- and golf ball-sized tumor in my colon,” Weston, 36, of Minneapolis, tells TODAY.com. “They can only say for sure that it was Stage 3 at that point, but there could have been a pretty good chance it could have already been Stage 4.” Ultimately, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer, and Weston eventually ran out of treatment options. Then she learned of a clinical trial that could help her. Excited, she enrolled and underwent the therapy in late 2022 and beginning of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since undergoing an experimental treatment, Emma Weston has had no evidence of disease and has been able to return to work and enjoying her family without worrying about being a cancer patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Emma Weston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two months after she completed the study, she learned some unexpected news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There was no evidence of disease. It was amazing,” she says. “My whole adult life up to that point I was pretty much a cancer patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The treatment she received uses “CRISPR gene editing” to create an individualized treatment for Stage 4 colorectal cancer patients, as Dr. Emil Lou, the principal investigator of the clinical trial, describes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was basically a designer type of treatment — a design for each individual patient treated in the trial,” Lou, who presented his findings at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in April, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In Emma’s case, it succeeded in eliminating any evidence of the cancer she had been dealing with for nearly a decade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After Thanksgiving 2013, Weston felt exhausted and saw her doctor for a physical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I thought I was burning the candle at both ends,” she says. “After that doctor’s visit, I went back to my apartment … and crashed for 48 hours.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she woke, her mom was “blowing up (her) phone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She was like, ‘I’m outside your apartment. Your doctor’s been calling me for a day trying to tell me that you need to go to the ER,’” Weston recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to her bloodwork, her hemoglobin levels were low, and she went to the emergency room, where doctors ran several tests. Finally, Weston underwent a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was kind of hazy from the sedation,” she says. “The doctor undoubtedly was like, ‘Oh, yeah that’s cancer.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tests and scans followed, and doctors identified the softball- and golf ball-sized masses and diagnosed her with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. First, she underwent surgery to remove the tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They removed most of my colon,” Weston says. “They sent in the team of oncologists to start talking to (me) about next steps, chemotherapy, obviously. And it’s intense. It’s a lot especially at that age.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After having Stage 4 cancer since 2013, Emma Weston got to a point where treatments weren't working effectively on her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Emma Weston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She underwent nine months of chemotherapy, which eliminated much of her cancer. But because there was still a microscopic amount of cancer that had spread to her peritoneum, she was upgraded to Stage 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Weston wasn't in remission, she was "in a good place where it wasn’t really growing fast," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Weston took a break from treatment, but after a few months, she needed to resume again. Over the years, Weston underwent various treatments with breaks in between. She has had experimental treatments, such as a HIPEC surgery in 2016, a procedure where doctors remove tumors and then bathe the abdominal cavity with heated chemotherapy. In 2018, she started radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re telling me that the disease (was) growing ... not at an alarming rate, like very slowly,” she says. “Nothing was helping (or) making it shrink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;So, she started another more intensive round of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That led to a whole bunch of other complications because it caused a rupture in where my colon had been resected back together from the first surgery,” Weston says. “They went in and removed the rest of my colon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For about six months, she had a temporary ileostomy to help her body heal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had already exhausted the chemo,” she says. “I was doing immunotherapy with chemotherapy for a while. Then they realized that’s not working.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eventually, she received immunotherapy every other week for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s when I’m like, ‘OK I’m out of options,’” she says. “I was waiting for a clinical trial.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she heard about Lou’s study, it piqued her interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t a tough decision for anything for me to make,” Weston says. “I was really jazzed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘Designer’ treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer treatments have improved at an “extremely rapid pace,” Lou says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Immunotherapy — a type of cancer treatment that harnesses a person’s immune system to treat their cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; — has helped patients with certain types of metastatic cancers, such as melanoma or lung cancer. But it hasn't been as successful with patients like Emma, with advanced colorectal cancer, says Lou, a professor of medicine in the division of hematology, oncology and transplantation at the University of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;During a break in cancer treatments, Emma Weston met her husband.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Emma Weston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In this trial, Lou and his colleagues used CRISPR, a tool that can modify the DNA of living organisms, to prevent cancer cells from evading the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More specifically, cancer cells can create blockages that stop the immune system from attacking them. These blockages on the immune calls are also called checkpoints. This study marked the first time researchers have used CRISPR to eliminate the CISH checkpoint in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Phase I trial — meaning it is the first in humans and had the goal of showing the therapy is safe — examined 12 patients with gastrointestinal cancers, including colon and rectal cancer. Like Weston, the other 11 participants had Stage 4 colorectal cancer and had failed other treatments. This experimental therapy provided a median survival rate of 129 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study shows that this therapy safely “unleashes the immune system” without causing an overreaction, Lou explains. A highlight is Weston’s outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Achieving what is called a complete response in Emma with previously metastatic, incurable Stage 4 form of colorectal cancer was a very important finding,” he says. “The thrill that we felt on seeing (Emma's) first and subsequent scans ... we hope to replicate for many other patients in the years to come and built upon it and to devise even better strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery is especially important as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/colon-cancer-top-cause-death-young-people-rcna134218" target="_blank"&gt;more young people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and researchers are unsure about what's causing the increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Lou says he and his team are in the planning stages of how to potentially make the treatment more available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘Happy to be here’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of 2022, doctors harvested some of Weston’s white blood cells to use as part of the treatment, allowing for the individualized part of therapy. In March 2023, she underwent five days of “intense” chemotherapy before receiving the experimental therapy via infusion. For the next month, she remained in the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Because you’ve had such intense chemo, your immune system is low,” she says. “They kept me in the hospital for a few more weeks after that just to watch.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Emma Weston was 23 when she was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.

She now returns annually for scans to make sure no cancer has returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m used to being in the hospital every other week,” she says. “It’s been amazing being able to get back to a somewhat normal lifestyle, which is something I never really got off the ground in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She’s able to work part time as an illustrator and in custom framing and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cancer sucks, but it’s not the whole journey,” she says. “There have been a couple of silver linings.

Court St., Kankakee, the contract, which expires at the close of business May 16, will not be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Having a preferred services agreement with Ascension St. Mary’s Hospital since May 2021, Westwood’s president, Dr. Roger Taylor, said the firm had no indication this decision was forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;The effect of this mid-May timeline, Taylor said, effectively removes St. Mary’s from being a birthing location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said when Westwood signed to be the medical group for St. Mary’s births four years ago, the hospital was performing about 200 births annually. The total was increased to an estimated 500 in following years before it settled at 350 yearly the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Riverside Medical Center, located only a couple miles west of St. Mary’s, handles the vast majority of Kankakee, Iroquois and even southeast Will County births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;In an email response from Prime to the Daily Journal, Prime confirmed the labor and delivery practice will conclude. A Prime spokesman said there are not enough births to keep the service as a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“... But the need for maternal care has dramatically declined in our hospital while access to these services is stable within the community at neighboring hospitals,” Prime said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;The decline of births at the hospital resulted in this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“This has led to the difficult, but necessary decision of transitioning OB services to Riverside Hospital and suspending OB services at St. Mary’s Hospital - Kankakee,” Prime said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;The spokesman said the hospital currently sees “just 26 births a month – less than one per day – with yearly births declining by nearly one-third since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“It is not possible to ensure the highest standards of quality care with such little volume and a service that was entirely dependent on any single physician,” the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 zdKnO"&gt;‘No hint of this coming’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Prime said all staff affected by the suspension of OB services will be offered comparable positions elsewhere within the hospital or at other Prime Illinois facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Prime said no other changes are planned at St. Mary’s at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said when Prime Healthcare acquired St. Mary’s as part of its larger purchase of other health care locations in Illinois, including St. Joseph’s Hospital in Joliet, they were informed no major changes in services would take place for at least 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;That situation was about two months ago, he said. He considers this action a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said Westwood offers St. Mary’s a top-notch practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“There was no hint of this coming,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;In a news release shared by Westwood, Taylor said the medical practice, founded in 1969, has served generations of Kankakee County women and families, delivering thousands of babies and remained a “cornerstone of women’s health in the region for 55 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said Westwood was informed in a notice of default on April 18 from Prime Healthcare, which formally acquired St. Mary’s Hospital in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“Westwood strongly disputes the claims made in that notice and has formally communicated its disagreement,” Taylor wrote in regard to the notice of default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“Despite this, Prime has confirmed its intent to end the agreement ... and has not committed to any continuation of funding or service agreement beyond that date,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;No formal transition plan for continuity of care has been shared, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said Prime suggested the possibility of Westwood resuming operations as an independent medical practice. Taylor said with such a limited notice and no funding, the feasibility of such a transition remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“This is not how we envisioned the end of more than five decades of service,” he said. “We are deeply proud of what we’ve built and the care we’ve provided.

By combining PET imaging and post-mortem brain analysis, the study showed that thicker rims lead to more aggressive brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery could enable earlier identification of patients needing intensive treatment and help assess the effectiveness of new therapies. The findings offer new hope for advancing treatment development, especially for progressive forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Thicker inflammatory rims around brain lesions indicate faster, more severe MS progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying aggressive cases early could improve patient outcomes with targeted treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Lesion rim measurements can help evaluate new MS drug candidates more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Turku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the University of Turku, Finland, have discovered a new biomarker that can predict the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thickness of the inflammatory cell rim surrounding brain lesions was found to directly correlate with the severity and speed of disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109342"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Ms-biomarker-neurology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Results show that the wider the inflammatory rim around a brain lesion is, the more aggressively the disease advances. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led at the University of Turku in Finland by Professor Laura Airas in collaboration with German and Dutch colleagues, has been published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better targeted treatments and faster drug development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research combined PET imaging data from 114 Finnish MS patients with post-mortem brain tissue analysis from Dutch MS patients. Results show that the wider the inflammatory rim around a brain lesion is, the more aggressively the disease advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When microglial cells form a thick rim around MS lesions, their harmful activity pushes deeper into healthy brain tissue, causing irreversible damage,” says Professor Laura Airas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery allows us not only to identify patients who need more aggressive treatment earlier but also to evaluate the effectiveness of new drug candidates by observing changes in lesion rims.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are expected to improve the development of treatments particularly for progressive MS, the yet undertreated form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eede1e3e3fbe0e7edeffae7e1e0fdcefbfafba0e8e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuomas Koivula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utu.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Turku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tuomas Koivula – University of Turku&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03625-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Broad rim lesions are a new pathological and imaging biomarker for rapid disease progression in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Laura Airas et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad rim lesions are a new pathological and imaging biomarker for rapid disease progression in multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current multiple sclerosis (MS) treatments reduce relapse activity but have limited impact on disease progression.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some dietary supplements are widely used to support health or reduce inflammation. However, not all supplements are suitable for everyone, especially if your goal is to lower inflammation. While certain nutrients and supplements may reduce inflammatory markers, others may have the opposite effect—raising levels of inflammatory markers or triggering an immune response that worsens inflammation. Before reaching for a new supplement, consider how it may affect &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation in your body&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kava is a plant that has been used in the Pacific Islands for thousands of years for medicinal and ritual purposes. Although rare, kava supplements have been linked to an increased risk of severe liver injuries and may increase inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, the water-based ingredients of kava may cause the body to release inflammatory molecules. Although some compounds in kava may offer anti-inflammatory benefits, it can pose some risks as well. &lt;a href="https://kcampbellnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kiran Campbell, RD&lt;/a&gt; and owner of KCampbell Nutrition explains, “While the active parts of kava may be helpful for reducing inflammation, other ingredients in kava may still trigger inflammation, especially when taken in traditional preparations or for long periods.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Most adults require between 8 and 18 milligrams of iron to meet their daily needs—and the upper limit that is considered safe is 40 milligrams per day. Consuming too much iron is associated with constipation, nausea, ulcers and higher levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some iron supplements can include more than the daily recommended intake, so it’s best to only take &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-iron-supplement-8637263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;iron supplements&lt;/a&gt; if you have an identified iron deficiency. And be sure to talk to your healthcare provider for individualized advice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is an omega-6 fatty acid supplement often used for weight and fat loss. One large analysis found that CLA reduced some inflammatory markers while significantly increasing participants levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is an inflammatory marker, with higher levels indicating more inflammation in the body. While more research is needed, early findings suggest that conjugated linoleic acid supplements can raise levels of inflammation among healthy individuals or those with normal CRP levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; is an essential fat-soluble vitamin, but high-dose supplementation has been linked to an increased inflammatory response. The recommended daily intake for adults ranges from 700 to 900 micrograms, and the upper limit that’s considered safe is more than 3,000 micrograms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the amount in vitamin A supplements can vary, some include more than 3,000 micrograms per serving. If taken regularly, this could lead to some negative health effects over time. According to one analysis, high-dose vitamin A supplements may significantly raise CRP levels, suggesting worsening inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Be mindful of the amount of vitamin A in any supplements you take, and be sure to talk to your doctor for individualized advice.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise can trigger inflammation when done at a high intensity for an extended period. However, under most circumstances, the inflammatory response to exercise is temporary, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054164/habit-to-break-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercise can be beneficial for reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the long term. Gradually incorporate exercise into your routine, with a goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Research shows lower levels of inflammatory molecules after &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7955973/is-yoga-alone-a-good-enough-form-of-exercise/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;practicing yoga&lt;/a&gt; or mindfulness &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7910926/what-is-walking-meditation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that the benefits of yoga on inflammatory markers are noticeable after just 10 days of practice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Packed with antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, legumes and healthy fats, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is primed to reduce inflammation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all supplements are harmless. Taking certain supplements, especially at high dosages, may exacerbate preexisting inflammation. Always follow the directions on the label and consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements. Instead of supplements, consider lifestyle modifications that focus on diet, exercise and stress management to reduce inflammation.

&lt;p&gt;Uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine has held mostly steady in recent years, but Black and Hispanic adults have seen more uptake, according to an analysis published earlier this month in&lt;em&gt; JAMA Network Open.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832475"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is based on responses to the 2019 and 2022 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys, which were used to create a weighted sample of 285,265 community-dwelling Medicare Advantage and Medicare Fee-for-Service enrollees aged 65 years or older.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half, 54.5%, of respondents were women. Two-thirds, 76.2%, were White; 8.0% were Black; 6.9% were Hispanic; and 4.2% were Asian, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rural White adults see drop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, between 2019 and 2022, overall influenza vaccination rates for older adults increased 0.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 1.1), from 76.3% to 77.0%, the authors said. For White and Asian adults, percentages remained unchanged, but Black and Hispanic adults, especially those living in rural communities, saw a significant increase in uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black adults with seasonal flu shots increased 7.0 percentage points (95% CI, 0.3 to 13.8) and&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hispanic adults by 8.2 percentage points (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.5). In sharp contrast, White adults in rural areas saw uptake drop by 2 percentage points over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the reasons for these divergent changes is a high priority for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Determining the reasons for these divergent changes is a high priority for future studies,” the authors concluded. “However, these descriptive findings are important to policymakers as they make decisions about how to invest in interventions that could influence influenza vaccination rates for populations with lower rates of uptake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Considering that in the United States, men are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm" target="_blank"&gt;four times more likely to take their own lives&lt;/a&gt; than women, the results of the Priory survey were not a big surprise. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of the survey participants acknowledged experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 40 percent of those who admitted to mental health challenges said they had never spoken to anyone about it. This is clearly not the healthiest approach to mental health management. If someone doesn't discuss their emotional baggage, the people around them are likely to assume that everything is okay. But not every emotional health challenge requires years of therapy. Sometimes, all a man needs is a reminder that others see the best in him and value his existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In marriage and long-term relationships, a man might — rightly or wrongly — derive much of his sense of self-worth from how his partner perceives him. In this sense, women can play an instrumental role in preserving men's confidence and self-esteem. We asked a panel of YourTango Experts to share their insight into how a woman might, with the right combination of gestures and words, help boost a man's confidence in himself and his place in the world. It's a small but important step toward helping men crash through the tough-guy stereotype and focus on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 3 small gestures that quietly boost a man’s confidence, according to experts:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Be present, listen, and validate his feelings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/how-finally-built-my-self-esteem-through-complete-total-radical-acceptance" target="_blank"&gt;self-esteem is an inside job&lt;/a&gt;. However, most men struggle with insecurity to some extent, and women can do small, basic things to help.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All men (not just your romantic partner):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look them straight in the eyes when they are talking and listen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/to-fall-love-with-partner-ask-these-questions"&gt;Ask them questions&lt;/a&gt; that get to the facts to inquire how they are feeling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow them to feel however they want with compassion, not criticism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When they say something you think is smart, let them know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laugh at their jokes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let them know you don’t blame them personally for global misogyny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your romantic partner:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell him what personality trait you find most attractive about him (especially if you have been together for a while).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell him about those unexpected moments when you think he looks hot (after a workout, in the shower, dressed for work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laugh with him about the things about him that drive you crazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask him out on a date you know he will like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell him how proud you are of him and that you are his partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take seriously events in his life that are important to him, even if they don’t interest you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/why-cuddling-most-underrated-human-activity" target="_blank"&gt;Cuddle with him&lt;/a&gt; at night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://goodmenproject.com/author/tom-matlack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Matlack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, writer, speaker, and men's health advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/things-men-want-from-women-wont-ask-for"&gt;10 Things Men Really Want From Women (But Won't Ask For), According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

At other times, I think it's as simple as just telling them the truth about &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/words-way-more-important-than-i-love-you" target="_blank"&gt;how thankful you are&lt;/a&gt; that they are in your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that, as women, we sometimes forget that men also need acknowledgment. I think we sometimes take our men for granted, and yet, the truth is, our lives are richer for having them in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.mimiwhittaker.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimi Whittaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, intuitive life coach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/what-men-want-more-love-and-how-give-it-them"&gt;The Secret Thing Men Want More Than Love (And How To Give It To Them)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Give him sincere, specific compliments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe heartfelt compliments are a strong confidence booster. &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/compliments-men-wish-wives-give-more-often" target="_blank"&gt;Sincere and specific compliments&lt;/a&gt; can have a profound impact on a man's confidence.

Her skin would turn red and burn. “Whenever bumps and flare-ups came, I’d say, ‘Yep, I did it, it’s my fault,’” Bagdoshvili said. She believed that trying so many skin-care products was causing these flare-ups so she started using fewer products in hopes that a “less is more” approach to skin care would help her, but it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma2sm6qa00183b6czmkp3foi@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;“The biggest mistake I made was trying to self-diagnose,” she says. It took her almost a year to seek out help from a professional. When she would post content with flushed cheeks, her comments section would fill up with questions like, “Is everything okay?” It took a few years before Bagdoshvili started to open up and share her skin-care journey with rosacea. “You expect a teenager to have bumps and everyone says when you get older, it’ll go away, but I wasn’t a teenager anymore. I was older and I was like, &lt;em&gt;What if it doesn’t go away?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma2sm6ks00173b6c7wrxecu0@published" data-word-count="41"&gt;Because she lives in Germany, she spent &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; less money than she would have in the United States trying to figure out the root of her skin concerns. Here’s how Bagdoshvili got a diagnosis and how she’s maintaining it now.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma2smsr5001n3b6cpp2uvuw3@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;After a year of constant flare-ups and no signs of improvement, Bagdoshvili visited a doctor’s office. Her doctor told her she had rosacea. The cream she was prescribed was Soolantra, a prescription medication (equivalent to Ivermectin) that treats rosacea with its anti-inflammatory properties. Her doctor also recommended using La Roche Posay’s Rosaliac line, formulated to reduce redness in the skin, ideal for rosacea patients.&lt;/p&gt;

That landed her back to the doctor’s office and also back at the pharmacy where she got a La Roche Posay sunscreen and its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Cicaplast-Madecassoside-Protectant-Multi-Purpose/dp/B0CZM9MCMK/ref=asc_df_B0CZM9MCMK?mcid=ffc293c519223247940e7f6d503a18a0&amp;amp;hvocijid=16992824185147109222-B0CZM9MCMK-&amp;amp;hvexpln=73&amp;amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=16992824185147109222&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9060351&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435180738&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20429aam__cma2sksgq00000icxnje7izqw__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;Cicaplast Balm B5&lt;/a&gt;, a soothing cream.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma2socdy002q3b6cfn3tz3au@published" data-word-count="132"&gt;Through trial and error, she found out how much her diet could’ve been triggering her flare-ups, too. “I was eating tomatoes everyday and having flare-ups every other day,” she said after finding out through research that they could trigger rosacea. Everyday became a learning session for her. She started drinking iced matcha because it helped with her skin’s inflammation. She spends a lot of her time looking through her comments on her videos, seeing what works for other people who have rosacea. Just a few weeks ago, she completely changed her diet to cleaner, noninflammatory foods like Greek yogurt with fruit and dark chocolate every morning and so far she’s been having fewer flare-ups than she’s used to. “For some people, dairy and chocolate can actually be triggers, but it works well for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

If you are stressed, if you’re excited or happy, you may get a flare-up. When I’m reading a book, I sometimes get red.” She considers her current routine simple. She still uses her prescribed Soolantra cream and she’s leaving the TikTok products alone now. Flare-ups still come, but lately this is how she’s maintaining her skin.&lt;/p&gt;

La Roche Posay is one because it’s sensitive skin-friendly and keeps her skin soothed without triggering any breakouts.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. There are a few azelaic acid products that Bagdoshvili switches between. One is Anua’s redness soothing serum with 10% azelaic acid and hyaluronic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

A recent study published in the journal &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=76202X1587086&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44298-024-00079-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2048405%2Fdeadly-disease-spread-insect-pandemic" rel="nofollow"&gt;npj Viruses&lt;/a&gt; said: “Unlike other &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/health/1892166/mosquito-warning-diseases-malaria-europe"&gt;mosquito-borne diseases,&lt;/a&gt; humans infected with YFV exhibit heightened viremia and are efficiently amplifying hosts, allowing for inter-human transmission by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This makes YFV particularly capable of sparking urban epidemics, as infected people can efficiently infect mosquitoes that bite them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international group of scientists added that while yellow fever has not yet been transmitted to the Asia-Pacific region the risk is higher than ever with studies suggesting an “expansion”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis" class="ovp-primis-h251"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper states: "A YF pandemic in today’s world would cause a devastating public health crisis that, because of the much higher lethality, would make the Covid-19 pandemic pale by comparison."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors added: “The concern that YFV will spread to the Asia Pacific region that Carter raised 100 years ago in his treatise on the subject remains equally pressing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed, we would argue that the likelihood of such a catastrophe could be even higher now than it was in Carter’s time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms of yellow fever appear three-six days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, in severe cases, the disease can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain, and bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bleeding can also occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach, WHO warns that about 15% of people will enter this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the patients who enter the "toxic phase" die within seven-10 days, WHO figures suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is not spread from person-to-person through coughing, sneezing, or touching. In forested areas, yellow fever virus primarily circulates between forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, such as monkeys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow fever is believed to infect around 200,000 people each year and to kill 30,000 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best way of preventing yellow fever. The vaccine provides immunity within 10 days for 80–100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of people vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNREJzVzJyWkpFX0MyZnZCYUhJY1hEX05Cckh3eTVmdVRmRVpiMWtodlg1MkdhMU1QeC1TeC04SU4xRVpBRWRlOWNCa2Y1NU9fVENmNndvemdiTU1zSXJxR3I5c0RGanU4and2NFY3MUZrOWR1elJsVGxLZW41NFhqa2RxcEVYZnhzM0HSAY8BQVVfeXFMTlRwRkFRS3VMRkNIeWxON1UwSmlVZDV6d09wckJ0dXlXZzZpd1NRZTZsYmxBeWF6S21kdkhWSzd6V2h3cHFLQnVGekZJOUlOdVpxSkc4VU5aTnhfTHRVZTQtTmJJUVFJR2EyMGRLRDZvVGZ5ZXp0MEMySjg2eVoxcHZNTUtrT0JsSWNXMG5YRzg</guid></item><item><title>减肥： Ozempic脚，口中不寻常的GLP-1副作用-健康线 | Weight Loss: Ozempic Feet, Mouth Among Unusual GLP-1 Side Effects - Healthline</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOZzBENVU2VGJSRVNOVHlqQVYxc3A5WUNhcjJ4b01aU2RhVHFhNnEtWmtkQWNKdDZHS21lSTcyczNyNEJxbndQLWV1NjRQcVNab2ZmN21tYkNXa0w0cXdVZV9OUHpsSmcyWnVOdTBpcFpQVVFOcl93UkUxNVV6U01NOW5RU0JQY2JtendHejVPazUxR2hq?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg" alt="Bare feet dangling over water" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-1dn5h5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth-news%2Fozempic-mouth-feet-unusual-side-effects-glp-1-drugs&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F04%2Fozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg&amp;amp;description=Weight%20Loss%3A%20Ozempic%20Feet%2C%20Mouth%20Among%20Unusual%20GLP-1%20Side%20Effects" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1dutyn6"&gt;Recent anecdotal reports have highlighted strange side effects of GLP-1 medications used for weight loss like “Ozempic mouth” and “Ozempic feet.” Elena Popova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Ozempic feet” and “Ozempic mouth” are the latest reported cosmetic side effects from GLP-1 medications used for weight loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts say wrinkles and sagging skin can result from rapid weight loss due to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; loss of fat and muscle mass in certain areas of the body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can minimize some of these effects by increasing protein in your diet and incorporating resistance training into your exercise routine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add “Ozempic feet” and “Ozempic mouth” to the growing list of nicknames for strange and unusual side effects from popular GLP-1 medications used for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports on social media and elsewhere have been highlighting “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/20/health/ozempic-feet-gnarly-side-effect-of-weight-loss-drug-exhibited-by-some-celebs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic feet&lt;/a&gt;,” a GLP-1 side effect resulting in excessively wrinkled feet. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIE_qTJzHcz/?igsh=bHdmdmthd3lpaHE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; of a barefoot Sharon Osbourne posted on Instagram set off a flurry of publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, “&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ozempic-face-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic face&lt;/a&gt;” describes the general hollowing of the face and an increase of wrinkles as people lose weight. There’s also the “&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ozempic-what-to-know-about-this-side-effect-you-may-experience-while-taking-weight-loss-drugs#What-Is-Ozempic-Butt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic butt&lt;/a&gt;” phenomenon, which occurs when sagging skin becomes pronounced around the buttocks as a person loses weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the drug Ozempic is most often pegged to these nicknames, the side effects can also be present with other injectable weight loss medications such as Wegovy, Zepbound, and Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the side effects aren’t a result of the medications themselves, but rather, are byproducts of rapid weight loss. They also note that these side effects are cosmetic and usually not a danger to a person’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these effects can be minimized through modifications in diet and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-exercise-for-weight-loss" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;. People could also try to lose weight at a slower pace to help reduce some of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need a team to follow you and help you,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/Dan%20Azagury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Dan Azagury&lt;/a&gt;, MD, FACS, an associate professor of surgery and the section chief of Minimally Invasive and Bariatric Surgery at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Get some support and do this in the right way,” he told Healthline. “This is not a sprint. Slow and steady wins this race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say wrinkles and sagging skin may sometimes occur after weight loss because of the loss of fat and the reduction in muscle mass throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any kind of significant weight loss can have a dramatic change in body habitus and appearance,” said &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see the same kind of changes after surgical weight loss as well, so it is more an effect of weight loss, rather than directly because of the medication,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nidhi.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Nidhi Pandya&lt;/a&gt;, an Ayurvedic doctor, holistic practitioner, and author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/773404/your-body-already-knows-by-nidhi-pandya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Your Body Already Knows&lt;/a&gt;,” said people should know the benefits and downsides of weight loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While these drugs are highly effective for lowering appetite and improving glycemic control, they also accelerate weight loss in a way that can have systemic consequences,” Pandya told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lists some of the side effects as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;loss of lean body mass&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;altered gut microbiome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;micronutrient deficiencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;impaired tissue repair&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My advice is to approach these medications as serious metabolic interventions, to be used after a thoughtful evaluation of risks and benefits,” said Pandya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/meet-kristin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Kristin Kirkpatrick&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, the president of KAK Consulting and a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Wellness &amp;amp; Preventive Medicine in Ohio, agreed it’s important to plan your weight loss journey carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, side effects of rapid weight loss can and do happen, but working with a healthcare provider and focusing on going above and beyond just taking the shot can help,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say you can counter these natural side effects through dedicated practices involving diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of these side effects can be minimized by supporting the body’s physiology and metabolism with targeted lifestyle strategies,” said Pandya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among her suggestions are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;consuming at least 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;limiting snacks and meal frequency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;starting meals with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-fermented-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; and high fiber vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stress management through techniques such as mindfulness and breath work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;structured sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While [these drugs] are powerful pharmacologic tools, the bedrock of metabolic health remains in intelligent, science-backed lifestyle strategies that support the body’s natural signaling and repair mechanisms,” said Pandya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my patients that when you are on these drugs you have to get nutritional bang for every bite,” said Kirkpatrick. “The mechanism of these drugs leads to a reduced intake of food and, therefore, you can’t really afford to consume foods that provide no nutritional benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardio is great and has many benefits, but resistance training can specifically help with muscle mass,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali noted it’s important to remember the purpose of weight loss programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People taking medication for weight loss or even undergoing surgery should realize the goal is to achieve &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-should-i-weigh" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt; to minimize obesity-related health conditions and achieve a normal lifespan,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight is inherently a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the body may need to store fat for various physiological reasons, including organ protection, hormone regulation, and nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azagury noted that the human body is also programmed to retain some fat in case of food shortages. “Your body is designed to avoid weight loss,” he said. “You’re fighting tens of thousands of years of evolution when you try to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that modern techniques, such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity/bariatric-surgery" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; and new weight loss medications, can make weight reduction a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no hierarchy in how we lose weight,” Azagury said. “There is no better or worse way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/whats-the-difference-between-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-and-zepbound#insurance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;

Ozempic is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, while Wegovy is approved for weight loss and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/whats-the-difference-between-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-and-zepbound#Mounjaro-and-Zepbound-Tirzepatide-What-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Mounjaro and Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; are injectable drugs that contain the active ingredient trizepatide. The FDA approves Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, while Zepbound is used for weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these drugs work in the same basic way by suppressing a person’s appetite. They do have some potential side effects. Some of the more common are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications have been shown in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mounjaro-superior-to-ozempic-for-blood-sugar-and-weight-loss-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to help people with obesity and other weight management issues lose weight effectively.

This has sparked renewed interest in a largely untapped yet promising resource: Nigeria’s indigenous food plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These plants – including their leaves, seeds, tubers, and fruits – are loaded with bioactive compounds. Laboratory studies show that many of these natural substances have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-plant-species-show-great-promise-in-fight-against-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow or even halt&lt;/a&gt; tumor growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that these plants, long consumed as part of the traditional diet, could be developed as low-cost, complementary tools in the nation’s fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plants-that-prevent-or-halt-cancer"&gt;Plants that prevent or halt cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have catalogued dozens of edible Nigerian species with measurable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-cancer activity&lt;/a&gt;, but nine stand out for the breadth of experimental data already available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spondias mombin&lt;/em&gt; (hog plum) contains the flavonoid quercetin along with carotenoids that trigger apoptosis – the “self-destruct” program in malignant cells – while simultaneously tamping down inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xanthosoma sagittifolium&lt;/em&gt;, a cocoyam cultivated widely in the humid south, produces tannins and other phenolics that cause leukemia cells to stall in the cell-cycle, blocking proliferation and reducing the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need in order to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil palm (&lt;em&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/em&gt;) is often maligned for ecological reasons, yet its vitamin-E–rich tocotrienols are potent antioxidants; in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-diet-improves-health-in-women-with-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; models they lower cell viability and force cells into arrest, nudging them toward death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Irvingia gabonensis&lt;/em&gt;, the African bush mango, supplies gallotannins that regulate metabolic pathways linked to tumorigenesis and stimulate immune surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powerful-cancer-fighting-plant-compounds"&gt;Powerful cancer-fighting plant compounds &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allium cepa&lt;/em&gt;, the humble onion, is packed with organosulphur compounds as well as flavonoids that up-regulate detoxification enzymes, mop up DNA-damaging free radicals and may even help reverse multidrug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blighia sapida&lt;/em&gt; (ackee) fruit, famous for its culinary role in Caribbean cuisine, also grows in Nigeria; laboratory work shows its flavonoids can hamper the ERK5 pathway, a key driver of aggressive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dioscorea dumetorum&lt;/em&gt;, a wild yam, synthesizes diosgenin – long prized in the pharmaceutical industry as a raw material for steroid hormones – which shuts off the pro-survival NF-κB and MAPK cascades in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/29123423/plants_anti-cancer-properties_nigeria_credit-google-photos_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/29123432/plants_anti-cancer-properties_nigeria_credit-google-photos_1s.webp" alt="Selected edible Nigerian plants with anti-cancer properties.

Angiogenesis – the sprouting of new blood vessels that feed a tumor – is another frequent target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds from cocoyam, yam and hog plum have been shown to lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and related signals, choking off the nutrient supply to nascent tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory enzymes (COX-2, iNOS) and reactive oxygen species are suppressed as well, reducing the chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fasting-helps-the-body-fight-inflammation-and-chronic-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress that often initiate or accelerate malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-tradition-and-modern-oncology"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bridging tradition and modern oncology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pre-clinical data are encouraging, several hurdles must be cleared before Nigerian food plants can take their place beside paclitaxel or cisplatin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioactive composition varies by soil type, rainfall pattern and harvest time; rigorous agronomic studies are needed to standardize cultivation and extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dosage, toxicity and potential interactions with conventional drugs remain largely untested in humans. Well-designed clinical trials – randomized, placebo-controlled and sufficiently powered – are essential if these botanicals are to earn a formal role in oncology clinics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the disconnect between traditional knowledge holders and laboratory scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethnobotanical surveys can help bridge that gap, ensuring that leads chosen for development reflect community practices and dietary realities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health campaigns, meanwhile, could educate physicians, pharmacists, and patients about the evidence base for plant-derived adjuncts, avoiding unsubstantiated claims while highlighting genuine benefits such as reduced side-effects or improved &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/active-aging-physical-activity-has-a-direct-impact-on-life-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-effective-renewable-treatments"&gt;Cost-effective, renewable treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these hurdles are overcome, the payoff could be substantial. Many of the plants grow wild or are already farmed for food, implying a local, renewable supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracts could be formulated as teas, capsules or functional foods, lowering barriers to access in rural areas where oncology centers are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining plant-based agents with lower doses of chemotherapy or radiation might retain efficacy while mitigating nausea, hair loss, and myelosuppression – side-effects that often deter patients from completing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fighting-cancer-with-plants-future-research"&gt;Fighting cancer with plants: Future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should prioritize mapping the full chemoprofile of each candidate plant. This should also include identifying synergistic combinations and unravelling pharmacokinetics in vivo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic and metabolomic tools can accelerate the discovery of lead molecules, while &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-nanotechnology-is-fighting-microplastic-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt; may enhance their bioavailability. Collaboration between Nigerian universities, pharmaceutical firms, and international cancer institutes will be vital to secure funding and regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Nigeria’s indigenous food plants harbor a rich arsenal of anticancer phytochemicals that attack tumours through multiple, complementary pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated with evidence-based medicine, these botanicals could broaden the therapeutic arsenal, reduce treatment costs and bring culturally familiar options to patients. Harnessing the plants may demand careful science, but the potential rewards will justify the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2835-6357/FIM-2024-00042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Integrative Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:40:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQUXBlVkZ0ZnhtcnRRZGVEX3ozNDZnR084aTd6eGM2UHlES3ctNXQ3eFRHemR3dFlMLUZOMkpOM3JVSGhLWkF2V0lOc2FEMFBmbUpTdkNEcVBubnlBUVpYNzB6aE9QSG5QZGsyVzhPbm92bG5DbUJEVTdmeTFxTW84MkhGOVdSTXVIcjVVTGZ3</guid></item><item><title>忘记胆固醇筛查。这种新的血液测试是解码心脏健康的最佳选择-女性健康 | Forget Cholesterol Screenings.

(Lipoproteins are proteins that combine with and transport fat in the blood.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers specifically focused on lipoproteins that carry a protein called apoB—that protein is typically linked with LDL or "bad cholesterol.” The researchers followed the participants for up to 15 years, looking at lipoprotein types and sizes that were most strongly linked to future heart attacks. They then compared that information with a separate Swedish cohort study to see how “bad cholesterol” lipoproteins lead to the development of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers discovered that apoB is the best way to test for heart disease, since measuring this protein actually indicates the total number of “bad cholesterol” particles better than your standard cholesterol test. Ultimately, they found that measuring a combination of apoB and a lipoprotein called Lp(a) gives the most accurate results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“LDL cholesterol is an important contributor to this risk, but does not tell the whole story,” says &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/150441" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/150441" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicholas A.

This is just done by a blood test that analyzes cholesterol levels, explains &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cheng-Han Chen" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But cholesterol can’t circulate in the blood or cause damage without a lipoprotein carrier, Dr. Chen points out. As a result, focusing on the lipoproteins that can carry “bad cholesterol” may be a more accurate way to tell a person’s future cardiovascular disease risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“ApoB appears to be the most accurate measure of cardio risk when compared to the traditional methods of measuring  LDL, HDL (“good cholesterol”), and other types we use,” Dr. Chen says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-bad-cholesterol-and-apob" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;What is “bad cholesterol” and &lt;em data-node-id="15.0.1"&gt;apoB&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Bad cholesterol” is another term for LDL cholesterol. “LDL cholesterol is the most common form of cholesterol and is known to cause heart disease,” Marston says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Again, apoB is a type of protein that’s typically linked with LDL or "bad cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"ApoB [is] a more accurate count of harmful particles," says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/ragavendra-baliga-mbbs-23370" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/ragavendra-baliga-mbbs-23370" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ragavendra Baliga" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ragavendra Baliga&lt;/a&gt;, MBBS, a cardiologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-can-i-get-one-of-these-tests" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Where can I get one of these tests?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The tests currently exist, and you can get one. “It’s not part of the normal cholesterol panel, but it is readily available at most testing laboratories,” Dr. Chen says. “Doctors would have to order this testing panel on top of what we currently use.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;However, it's not common. "I’ve never, ever ordered apoB," Dr. Baliga says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, Dr. Chen says if your doctor determine it’s needed, it is possible to get one. “If we are especially concerned or if the patient is especially concerned, we can add this test on to get more information,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

Her heart took its last beat while she was surrounded by her loving family and Father Joe Robinson as they finished praying The Rosary.  She passed as the hour hit 5:00 p.m.; it was truly “5:00 somewhere”, and she wanted to be in paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria was born on October 6, 1992, and for 32 years, she was an incredible daughter, sister, granddaughter, aunt, Godmother, and friend to all. She graduated from Wadsworth High School in 2011 and The Ohio State University in 2015, then finished her education with a Master of Anesthesia from Case Western Reserve University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria will be remembered for her unique, beautiful, curly hair, smile, and laugh that would light up a room. She was a kind, generous, and caring person who always put others first. Her authentic love for Ohio State, spending time at her favorite place, Lake Buckhorn, shopping, antiques, travel, spending time with her wonderful friends, and love for dolphins will always be remembered. She was gifted in her job as an anesthetist, as she worked and lived in Columbus. She not only worked with patients, but she taught for a semester as a professor in Anesthesia as well. Maria was an enthusiastic reader, absolutely adored classic Disney movies, and was an avid Harry Potter fan. She loved the thrill of roller coasters and amusement parks, especially visiting Disney and Universal Studios. Her taste in music, good food, and creative charcuterie boards will always be remembered. She truly knew how to have fun and enjoy life. Maria was very compassionate and had the gift of making everyone feel loved. Knowing how to enjoy life and love others are qualities we will always strive to uphold and never forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria is survived by her parents, Dale &amp;amp; Debbie Fortner; sisters, Sarah (Dan), Olivia (boyfriend, Alex), Sophia, and Julia (boyfriend, Aaron); Godson/nephew, Lincoln; grandparents, Sally and Sam Tomlinson, along with countless uncles, aunts, cousins, and friends. Maria will also be deeply missed by the family dogs, Rambo and Kava. She was welcomed into heaven by her grandparents, Lillian &amp;amp; Dick Fortner, eight great-grandparents &amp;amp; dog Romeo, all of who she loved and adored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;The family would like to thank the University Hospital medical team, who did everything possible to heal Maria and prolong her life.

Patients received a 500-milligram dose of dostarlimab intravenously every three weeks, for a total of nine treatments. Almost 40 percent of patients had no side effects at all, Diaz said; some patients experienced mild rashes or itching, while a smaller number experienced more serious lung infections and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YI3DNPSS7VFN5LWGTZ3CQ2EDR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diaz is hopeful dostarlimab will become an available option for the small number of cancer patients with mismatch repair mutations — and that it becomes eligible for insurance reimbursement. (The drug costs about $11,500 a vial, and nine doses are required).

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that Parkinson’s often is not diagnosed until the disease is in its later stages, and its hallmark symptoms, like tremor and walking problems, are more evident. By that time, however, the brain is often irreversibly damaged, per the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this novel test, which measures a protein called alpha-synuclein that is misfolded in Parkinson’s patients, is showing promise for helping reliably diagnose Parkinson’s disease — even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the future it could be used to monitor disease progression, guide treatment decisions, and accelerate the development of new drugs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test uses samples of CSF, collected via a spinal tap, to directly test misfolded alpha-synuclein — a molecular hallmark of Parkinson’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists detailed their findings in “&lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00229-z"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alpha-synuclein misfolding as fluid biomarker for Parkinson’s disease measured with the iRS platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Use of new technique may allow Parkinson’s diagnosis at early stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by a progressive loss of the brain’s dopaminergic neurons, which are the nerve cells that produce dopamine, a signaling molecule essential for motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;Diagnosing&lt;/a&gt; the condition mainly relies on the onset of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including slowness of movement, medically known as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability. Still, by the time of symptom onset, the disease is often advanced, with more than half of the dopaminergic neurons already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is an unmet medical need for fluid biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy based on a biological classification,” the researchers wrote. The team noted that such biomarkers already have been established for &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/what-is-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, which also is marked by progressive neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s patients, the misfolding of the protein alpha-synuclein into toxic clumps called Lewy bodies is thought to interfere with the function of dopaminergic neurons and contribute to their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klaus Gerwert, PhD, a study lead, noted that “these misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those complexes are known as oligomers, according to Gerwert, founding and managing director at the Center for Protein Diagnostics at Ruhr University Bochum (PRODI) in Germany, and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.beta-sense.de/en/"&gt;Betasense&lt;/a&gt;, a university spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain,” Gerwaert said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2025-04-25-biophysics-new-body-fluid-biomarker-parkinsons-disease-discovered"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt; on the team’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from PRODI and Betasense found that measuring misfolded alpha-synuclein in the CSF — using this new technique — can aid in reliably diagnosing Parkinson’s at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique is based on a patented immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) platform technology from Betasense, which can directly detect folded versus misfolded alpha-synuclein in bodily fluids that absorb different wavelengths of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRS technology has already been applied to Alzheimer’s, which is characterized by the misfolding of amyloid-beta in the brain. A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12745"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed it was able to assess the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia at a later stage with high accuracy, up to 17 years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson’s for the misfolding of [alpha-synuclein],” Gerwert said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Test for Parkinson’s disease uses same approach as one for Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used the iRS platform to test 134 CSF samples. The discovery group involved 59 individuals, of whom 17 were diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The remaining 42 people, who had no signs of neurodegenerative diseases, served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validation group consisted of 75 individuals, 40 of whom had Parkinson’s and five with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;multiple system atrophy&lt;/a&gt; (MSA), a neurodegenerative disorder with similar symptoms to Parkinson’s. Because misfolding of alpha-synuclein is also known to occur in MSA, both Parkinson’s and MSA patients were called the misfolding-positive group. All other participants were grouped as one disease control. That group comprised those with corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team demonstrated that the ratio of two iRS wavelengths of light, 1656.0 to 1623.5 per cm, significantly distinguished between folded and misfolded alpha-synuclein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, using this ratio, the researchers found the ability to distinguish Parkinson’s/MSA patients from controls was 90% in the discovery group and 86% in the validation group. When both datasets were combined, the classification accuracy was 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The structure-based biomarker … now enables a biological classification for [Parkinson’s disease] for timely identification and intervention, potentially slowing the disease progression and improving patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the levels of the wavelength ratio, the participants were then grouped again. One group comprised individuals with high levels of misfolded alpha-synuclein, indicating they likely had Parkinson’s or MSA. The other had those with low levels, who did not show signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing just these two groups, the test identified Parkinson’s or MSA with 95% accuracy. It correctly detected 97% of people who had the disease (sensitivity) and correctly identified 92% of people who did not have it (specificity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRS readings that fell between these two levels, referred to as the intermediate group, reflected a continuum of misfolding between a healthy and diseased state. These individuals may have an elevated risk of developing diseases related to alpha-synuclein misfolding compared with unaffected individuals, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
