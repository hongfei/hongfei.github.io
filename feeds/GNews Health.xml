            Jenna Scott remembers the joy of being pregnant with her first and only child. She also remembers the immense abdominal pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000c3b6p9wfliiza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During her pregnancy, she let her doctors know about the persistent discomfort. She was told it was normal, that the aches “came with the territory,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000d3b6p93749s0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But after she delivered a healthy baby boy, the pain didn’t fade. It lingered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000e3b6pr1vwl8ef@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than a year later, Scott received a diagnosis that shook her sense of normalcy: stage 4 colon cancer. She was 31 years old at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000f3b6pvd2kyr6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We did a colonoscopy and when I woke up, there was my husband, my doctor and four nurses in the room. The GI doctor said he didn’t need to send anything off to pathology to know that I had cancer,” Scott, now 39, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000g3b6p79h5x5u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stage 4 cancer, also known as metastatic cancer, means the cancer has spread from its original location to other parts of the body. For Scott, she said the disease spread from her colon to her liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000h3b6p216u5dvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve always been super fit and healthy. I’ve been an athlete all my life. I didn’t even grow up eating red meat. In an instant, my life changed completely and unexpectedly,” she said. “I was in a state of disbelief because that word ‘cancer’ didn’t live in my world. Cancer means death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000i3b6pv52s4t63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a concerning trend, colorectal cancer now appears to be the deadliest cancer for young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000j3b6pggxl5evy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Colorectal cancer has surpassed other cancer types to become the leading cause of cancer deaths among people under 50 in the United States, as of 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.25467?guestAccessKey=5eabd609-08b0-47c7-a738-916c7acdcc37&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=012226" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000k3b6pvpe8cg3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deaths from colon and rectal cancers in the under-50 age group rose by 1.1% annually since 2005, the research found. Because of this rise, colorectal cancer went from being the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths among people younger than 50 in the early 1990s to becoming the top cause in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000l3b6ppujlttzm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t know why it is increasing,” said Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of surveillance, prevention and health services research at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000m3b6p6mi1m4fv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mortality for the other major causes of cancer deaths in young adults under 50 is declining. It is only colorectal cancer mortality that is increasing, but we really don’t know fully what contributes to this rising burden,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000n3b6ph4xvmax6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott, an advocate for the nonprofit Colorectal Cancer Alliance, also finds the new research troubling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000o3b6pf8e78rv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After years of treatment – which included chemotherapy medications, targeted therapy and surgery – she is now in stable condition, but she said that she must “continue chemotherapy and targeted therapy indefinitely,” because each time she has stopped treatment before, the cancer came back and spread further to other organs in her body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000p3b6puqa5mz52@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As she now continues treatment, Scott said that her goal is to “become a grandmother one day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000r3b6pfy1a4p8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the new research, Jemal and his colleagues at the American Cancer society analyzed the annual numbers and rates of cancer deaths among people under 50 in the United States from 1990 through 2023, based on data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000s3b6pt4uqnuil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the most complete data we have,” Jemal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000t3b6ptlfa8y3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers examined the five leading causes of cancer death among the under-50 age group. They found that overall, from 1990 through 2023, more than 1.2 million people died of cancer in the United States before age 50, and the death rate fell by 44% during that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000u3b6pdduox5om@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data also showed that deaths decreased for every leading cancer type, except for colorectal cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000v3b6pk6hpvwnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the five leading causes of cancer death in people under 50, the average annual decline in deaths from 2014 through 2023 was 0.3% for brain cancer, 1.4% for breast cancer, 2.3% for leukemia and 5.7% for lung cancer, according to the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000w3b6pvjolml72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research findings suggest that as of 2023, the top five causes of cancer deaths among people younger than 50 in the United States were:

            “We weren’t expecting colorectal cancer to rise to this level so quickly, but now it is clear that this can no longer be called an old person’s disease,” Jemal said in a news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We must double down on research to pinpoint what is driving this tsunami of cancer in generations born since 1950,” he added.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“In the meantime, people 45-49 years make up fifty percent of diagnoses under 50, so increased screening uptake will prevent disease as well as death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As a young adult with colorectal cancer, Scott said that the research findings were “pretty disturbing” for her.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr700103b6pcjphhe3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What has to happen to draw more awareness to this disease and the people who are mostly being affected by it today? Why are seemingly healthy adults and children continuing to die from this disease? Why are women becoming more and more affected? How do you prevent something when you nor your team of doctors know how you got it in the first place?” Scott said in the email. “We have to stop this increase in mortality.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr700113b6p2juen9cq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are nearly 60 new colorectal cancer cases diagnosed in people under 50 each day in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://colorectalcancer.org/basics/facts-and-statistics#:~:text=Colorectal%20cancer%20is%20the%20fourth%20most%20common%20cancer%20in,among%20men%20and%20women%20combined.&amp;amp;text=Each%20year%2C%20about%20150%2C000%20Americans%20are%20diagnosed%20with%20colorectal%20cancer.&amp;amp;text=More%20than%2050%2C000%20people%20will%20die%20from%20colorectal%20cancer%20this%20year.&amp;amp;text=One%20in%2024%20people%20will,colorectal%20cancer%20in%20their%20lifetime." target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — that’s a diagnosis about every 25 minutes.

            The new research is an important reminder for people under 50 to stay up-to-date on their cancer screenings, Jemal said. It’s recommended for people at average risk of colorectal cancer to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;start regular screening at age 45&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr700143b6plwk5fwc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet “only 37% of adults ages 45 to 49 are up-to-date for their colorectal cancer screening,” Jemal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpkxq4o00013b6pxhtyfert@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Colorectal cancer screening can not only detect cancer at the early stage, but also it removes the polyps before it becomes cancer,” he said. “So, it’s one of the two screening types that we have that not only detects cancer at early stage but also prevents it, the other being cervical cancer screening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr700153b6p61pyz36t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research is “timely” and highlights a “red flag,” said Dr. Y. Nancy You, professor at the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffaculty.mdanderson.org%2Fprofiles%2Fyi-qian_you.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7Cafea9cdb895a4157d09d08de591d8b83%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639046180643527548%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=pNczevsVBSBzaiEytcgwRqBZp7EtBo0lwCnU0kqwvBA%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt; and director of its Young-onset Colorectal Cancer Program, who was not involved in the new paper.

            But while screening for colorectal cancer among healthy younger adults with no symptoms is critically important, “that’s only part of the story. I think there is a tremendous gap – and opportunity – in expeditiously diagnosing and treating people who are already symptomatic,” You said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There is an unmeasurable group of young adults who have symptoms that may be consistent with colorectal cancer, but either sit on the symptoms because they are busy or are scared, or eventually access their health care system but encounter a provider who thinks it’s just a hemorrhoid and doesn’t trigger further investigations,” You said, referring to when patients’ symptoms sometimes get dismissed by their providers.

            “So, there are definitely delays in diagnosing young adults who are already symptomatic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001a3b6prjw4hwki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When there are delays in diagnosing cancer, it becomes more likely that the disease will be diagnosed at later stages, such as stage 3 or 4. When cancer is at an advanced stage, it may have spread beyond the tumor itself into surrounding regions or other parts in the body, making it more difficult to treat and the patient becomes less likely to survive, regardless of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001b3b6pi78l25ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why the increase in colorectal cancer deaths appears to be happening at a time when more people under 50 are being diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001c3b6phtx90on9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For colorectal cancer, “those under 45 are not screened, so they’re not diagnosed until they have symptoms. In many of those, about three-fourths, those symptoms are actually because they have much more advanced disease, and then the outcomes are worse, regardless of their age,” Cercek said, adding that the new research highlights a greater need to diagnose young patients quickly and not dismiss their symptoms because of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001d3b6pbkgq7ook@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7423740/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 60%&lt;/a&gt; of colorectal cancer patients under 50 are diagnosed after the disease has already advanced to stage 3 or 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001e3b6plwge7fkp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In this younger group, when we do see later stage of diagnosis, that is highly associated with lower survival,” said Christine Molmenti, an associate professor and cancer epidemiologist at Northwell Health in New York, who was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001f3b6plv77e88d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve met a lot of patients under 50 with this disease, and I think it is very heartbreaking,” she said. “Anecdotally, what we see a lot of times is that these patients are healthy. They’re fit. Sometimes they’re athletes. There were a couple of patients who had not survived the disease, but their parents told us that they ran a marathon four months before their stage 4 colon cancer diagnosis. And often times young people ignore symptoms, or their symptoms are dismissed. So, I think there needs to be awareness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

"You can get vitamin D from most pharmacies and retailers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As we say, however, many medics have recently argued that this shouldn't be a blanket rule, claiming some patients have reported experiencing four indicators that the supplements are having adverse effects on their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Switching up your dosage might be advised (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Biomedical scientist Tobias Mapulanga explained: "As the NHS encourages vitamin D in winter, many people are reaching for bottles in the darker months and accidentally overshooting, then blaming the fallout on seasonal bugs, when constant thirst and needing the loo more often, queasiness, tummy pain or constipation, headaches or brain fog, and new aches or cramps appear soon after increasing your intake or adding sprays or gummies, that points to a supplement backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The stakes are clear: the right amount supports you, but doubling up can turn a well-meant routine into feeling worse rather than better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Constantly needing a wee, but still feeling thirsty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you find some weeks after starting to take Vitamin D supplements that you're needing to urinate more often, and constantly feel thirsty, it could be an indictor that you're taking too much then you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is because Vitamin D has the potential to disrupt both fluid and salt balance, which came leave a person both parched, but needing the loo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It is recommended in these cases, to take absolutely no more than the prescribed 10mg, and to always keep water close by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Vitamin D can cause extreme thirst (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feeling nauseous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Enduring general sickness, burping more than you usually would, or suffering from a sour stomach could also be a sign that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This could be because some variations of Vitamin D could contain sweeteners or flavourings that throw off a person's stomach acid levels, and trigger irritation. It's recommended in these cases to either take your supplement with a main meal, and switch from taking sprays of gummies to tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Achy bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you notice you're cramping more often, or just feeling generally much more fatigued that usual, it could be a sign that Vitamin D supplements aren't for you. An excessive amount of this nutrient can upset the minerals that your muscles rely on, and this, mixed with potential dehydration, could cause muscles to cramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's recommended to adjust your amount in these cases, as well as to drink a large glass of water with meals, and add things like yoghurt, leafy greens, beans and bananas into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Too much Vitamin D can cause aches and pains (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Struggling to focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Has your brain felt foggier than usual since you started taking Vitamin D supplements? If so, again, it could indicate you've taken too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;High doses of this specific nutrient can cause a person's calcium levels to surge, with additives like sweeteners also having the potential to muddle their thinking. In these cases, it is recommended that a person takes their pill with food, or to choose a product listing only cholecalciferol as a bulking agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>tyla.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:03:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPYjNlUUpOZVBCMXRJR01kQm9FWXpubGs0MzBWbVd6a2MwaWhWNnB0ZF9oTlBIU3I1QW1EUTZXMG5Mcjk3eTdwUFMxcXB5T2hJbVhteTktTmNiRVplN2VyQ1BaRHhveTAwd25sa0RDSTRLWUdxeE9ILS1uVTNlQ216Y2FB</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，推动睾丸激素测试的“Manosphere”影响者正在说服健康的年轻人，他们有问题-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/22/manosphere-influencers-testosterone-tests-young-men</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’re not waking up in the morning with a boner, there’s a large possibility that you have low testosterone levels,” an influencer on TikTok with more than 100,000 followers warns his viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite screening for low testosterone being medically unwarranted in most young men, this group is being aggressively targeted online by influencers and wellness companies promoting hormone tests and treatments as essential to being a “real man”, a study published in the journal Social Science and Medicine has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers analysed 46 high-impact posts about low testosterone and testing made by TikTok and Instagram accounts with a combined following of more than 6.8 million, to examine how masculinity and men’s health are being depicted and monetised online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4dde43ac-b3ef-42bb-bb66-44fb1419ccf8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Social media misinformation driving men to seek unneeded NHS testosterone therapy, doctors say","elementId":"4dde43ac-b3ef-42bb-bb66-44fb1419ccf8","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/08/social-media-misinformation-driving-men-to-nhs-clinics-in-search-of-testosterone-they-dont-need"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, Emma Grundtvig Gram, a public health researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said influencers promoting routine testosterone screening often framed normal variations in energy, mood, libido or ageing “as signs of pathology”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This meant “men may come to perceive themselves as inherently deficient or in need of medical intervention”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This creates a sense of urgency for solutions, which in turn fuels lucrative markets for pharmaceuticals, supplements and medical devices, even in the absence of clear clinical benefit. More broadly, this contributes to the medicalisation of masculinity itself. It reinforces a narrow, idealised model of masculinity, while marginalising non-traditional or diverse expressions of gender.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Testosterone naturally declines with age but it is not inevitable for all men, and lower levels may also be linked to factors including type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and the use of certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gram and her colleagues found the posts often targeted younger, fit men and contained messaging aligned with the “manosphere” – online communities that circulate ideas about male superiority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Within this narrative, so-called ‘alpha men’ are promoted as dominant, sexually successful and physically powerful, and our study found testosterone was positioned as the key to achieving this status,” Gram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This connection is important because it shows that testosterone marketing is not just about health, but is embedded in wider cultural and ideological narratives about gender and power, and the manosphere is not simply an ideology, but also an industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Ada Cheung, an endocrinologist in the University of Melbourne’s department of medicine who was not involved in the study, said routine screening for low testosterone in asymptomatic men, including younger men, was not supported by Australian guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Generally, testing is recommended only when symptoms such as delayed puberty or reduced libido are present, or in specific clinical circumstances, such as after testicular surgery or chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms commonly attributed to low testosterone were often non-specific and overlapped with fatigue, stress, anxiety, depression and relationship difficulties, Cheung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This often leads to discussions about the normal range of testosterone, the limited evidence for benefit in otherwise healthy men, and the potential risks of unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not hard to get testosterone on the black market or on the internet or in gyms, so many who want to try it may not seek out medical advice necessarily. Risks of unwarranted testosterone testing or treatment include masking of underlying conditions, and unnecessary exposure to side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These can include infertility, cardiovascular risk and thickened blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="523d0149-d6b2-465b-a07a-8f7627ec2df8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":17,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Looking for Mr T: the politicisation of testosterone","elementId":"523d0149-d6b2-465b-a07a-8f7627ec2df8","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/28/looking-for-mr-t-the-politicisation-of-testosterone-and-toxic-masuclinity"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gram’s study found 72% of social media posts analysed also had financial interests, such as selling testosterone tests, treatments or supplements, or were sponsored by industry.

&lt;p&gt;Aging has traditionally been viewed as a gradual and continuous process shaped by time, genetics, and environment. However, advances in molecular biology are challenging this assumption, revealing that physiological aging may proceed unevenly across the lifespan rather than at a constant pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A multi-omics study has identified &lt;strong&gt;two distinct age ranges&lt;/strong&gt;. These inflection points suggest that aging is driven not only by accumulation, but also by disruption, with implications for how biological age is measured and how disease risk, screening strategies, and preventive interventions are approached in mid- to late adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Evidence Points to Critical Biological Turning Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team at &lt;em&gt;Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; tracked over 135,000 biological markers in 108 individuals over several years. The study, led by Dr. Michael Snyder, chair of genetics, found that &lt;strong&gt;81 percent of molecules associated with aging changed in non-linear patterns&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than progressing steadily, molecular activity underwent rapid shifts at two defined ages: &lt;strong&gt;44 and 60&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research focused on multi-omic datasets, including &lt;strong&gt;metabolomic, proteomic, and microbiome&lt;/strong&gt; data. It revealed significant changes in cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic functions during the identified age ranges. These included fluctuations in lipid metabolism, alcohol and caffeine processing, and markers tied to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biological samples were collected at regular intervals, enabling time-sensitive insights. Participants in their 40s exhibited measurable shifts in pathways associated with &lt;strong&gt;muscle maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2026/01/sunburn-cause-finally-discovered-rna-damage-not-dna/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117958" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and organ function. Those in their early 60s showed altered indicators of immune system regulation, kidney filtration, and chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiaotao Shen, a co-author, noted a high density of molecular transitions clustered around the two age markers. These did not appear in adjacent age ranges, suggesting discrete periods of elevated biological volatility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Microbiome as a Core Driver&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study placed particular emphasis on the &lt;strong&gt;human microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;, a dense microbial ecosystem primarily located in the gastrointestinal tract. Shifts in microbiome composition were strongly associated with both age thresholds. These changes are linked to key physiological processes, including nutrient absorption, immune signaling, and neurochemical production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that microbial diversity and abundance changed in parallel with systemic molecular markers. This co-variation reinforces existing research suggesting the microbiome plays a role in modulating the biological aging process. Disruptions in microbial equilibrium have previously been associated with cognitive decline, inflammatory disorders, and metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-17.png.webp" alt="Image" class="wp-image-118245"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample collection and multi-omics data acquisition of the cohort. Four types of biological samples were collected, and 10 types of omics data were acquired. Credit: Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not directly identify causality, the concurrent shifts across molecular systems and microbial ecosystems suggest a high degree of interdependence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Behavior and Biology Intersect in Midlife&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also addressed the possibility that lifestyle patterns may coincide with or trigger biological inflection points. Dr. Snyder highlighted midlife behavioral trends such as increased alcohol intake and sustained stress as potential contributors to metabolic disruptions. “Alcohol metabolism may falter due to increased consumption that often occurs in midlife,” he said in an earlier interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these hypotheses remain under investigation, prior studies have linked long-term stress and poor sleep quality to deteriorating cardiovascular and immune function. The data from the Stanford study align temporally with &lt;strong&gt;life-stage transitions&lt;/strong&gt;, such as peak occupational pressure and shifts in family responsibilities, which may carry physiological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;strong&gt;allostatic load&lt;/strong&gt;, referring to cumulative biological wear and tear from chronic stress, provides a theoretical framework for understanding how psychosocial factors might influence the timing of biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limited Scope, High Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its depth, the study presents several limitations. The sample size of 108 individuals restricts statistical generalizability, and the cohort was not demographically representative. Broader replication will require expanded datasets with greater ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data are observational, not interventional; as such, causality cannot be inferred. While the research identifies correlations between molecular changes and age, it does not establish whether these changes are driven by internal biological clocks, external environmental triggers, or their interaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data collection also required &lt;strong&gt;frequent biospecimen analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, which may not be feasible in large-scale clinical environments. This logistical burden highlights a tension between the precision of the findings and their scalability for public health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cost remains another barrier. Multi-omic data generation and high-resolution longitudinal tracking are resource-intensive, limiting accessibility to elite research institutions with long-term funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rethinking Health Strategies for the 40s and 60s&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If validated through further studies, these findings could influence clinical screening guidelines and reshape how midlife health risk is assessed. Current models often rely on chronological age as a proxy for physiological risk. The Stanford research proposes an alternative framework rooted in &lt;strong&gt;biological transitions&lt;/strong&gt; tied to specific life stages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging &lt;strong&gt;precision medicine initiatives&lt;/strong&gt; could incorporate molecular screening at midlife to predict susceptibility to chronic disease. Pharmaceutical development may also pivot toward therapies targeting the biological mechanisms that intensify around these identified inflection points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings may be relevant for institutions developing aging-related policies, including retirement age planning, healthcare forecasting, and insurance actuarial models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The arrival of semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs in recent years has ushered in a new era of obesity treatment. These drugs, which mimic the GLP-1 hormone, help people lose substantially more weight than they typically would with diet and exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk. It’s the active ingredient in the type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic and the obesity treatment Wegovy, both taken as a weekly shot. Though only Wegovy is approved for obesity, Ozempic has become the cultural shorthand for GLP-1 therapy (notably, Ozempic is often prescribed off-label for weight loss). But Ozempic’s reign on top looks to be coming to a close, if it isn’t already here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide (Zepbound and Mounjaro) combines GLP-1 with a second hunger-related hormone called GIP and provides greater weight loss on average than semaglutide. And there’s a bevy of GLP-1-based drugs on the horizon vying for approval, with some likely to reach the public this year. Even Novo Nordisk is looking to upgrade its products. Last December, it &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-wegovy-pill-is-officially-here-2000702882"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; FDA approval for a once-daily pill form of Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here are some of the Ozempic rivals most likely to make a splash in the world of obesity treatment in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;1. Orforglipron&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developed by Eli Lilly, orforglipron mimics the GLP-1 hormone. Unlike most GLP-1 drugs, however, it’s taken as a once-daily pill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Phase III clinical trial data &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-pill-to-fight-obesity-is-on-the-verge-of-approval-2000648312"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last year, people on the highest dose of orforglipron lost, on average, 10% of their baseline body weight, compared to the 2.5% average weight loss seen in people taking a placebo. A study released last month also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/eli-lillys-experimental-pill-could-help-you-ditch-glp-1-obesity-shots-trial-finds-2000701348"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that orforglipron could help people maintain most of the weight they lost on other GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. Eli Lilly has since petitioned the FDA to approve orforglipron as an obesity treatment, with a decision expected sometime this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Should it win approval, though, orforglipron will likely face some headwinds. The drug’s effectiveness might be below that of other popular drugs on the market, including Novo Nordisk’s oral version of Wegovy, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-wegovy-pill-is-officially-here-2000702882"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; late last year. But the company is banking on orforglipron having enough advantages to entice some doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, many may prefer a daily pill over a weekly injection, either as a first-line treatment or as maintenance therapy. And unlike the Wegovy pill, orforglipron can be used without any food or timing restrictions (oral Wegovy needs to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before eating, to be most effective).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;2. CagriSema&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;CagriSema is a weekly injectable drug being developed by Novo Nordisk. It combines the GLP-1 mimic semaglutide with cagrilintide, which mimics another hunger-related hormone called amylin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late-stage clinical trials, people taking CagriSema have lost up to 22.7% of their baseline weight over a year’s time. The company &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-files-for-fda-approval-of-cagrisema-the-first-once-weekly-combination-of-glp1-and-amylin-analogues-for-weight-management-302645862.html"&gt;officially submitted&lt;/a&gt; the drug for FDA approval in late December, with a decision expected this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If approved, CagriSema could arguably become the most effective GLP-1 drug currently available to the public. It would also signify that amylin-based drugs could be another viable approach to obesity treatment. At the same time, the Phase III results weren’t quite as impressive as Novo Nordisk appeared to be expecting (&lt;a href="https://www.pharmexec.com/view/novo-nordisk-cagrisema-falls-short-25-weight-loss-target-patients-obesity-overweight#:~:text=The%20results%20come,tirzepatide.2"&gt;25% or greater&lt;/a&gt; weight loss), and it will face stiff market competition from Eli Lilly’s existing drug tirzepatide, which has provided slightly lower but similar results in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;3. VK2735&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have dominated the landscape of GLP-1 therapy so far, but there are some competitors looking to challenge that dominance. For example, there’s Viking Therapeutics and its candidate VK2735. The drug combines GLP-1 and the hormone GIP (similar to tirzepatide) and is being developed in both an injectable and oral form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the latest Phase II data &lt;a href="https://ir.vikingtherapeutics.com/2025-08-19-Viking-Therapeutics-Announces-Positive-Top-Line-Results-from-Phase-2-VENTURE-Oral-Dosing-Trial-of-VK2735-Tablet-Formulation-in-Patients-with-Obesity#:~:text=SAN%20DIEGO%2C%20Aug.,categorized%20as%20mild%20or%20moderate."&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last August, people taking oral VK2735 lost up to 12% of their body weight over a 13-week period. Typically, it takes about six months to a year for a GLP-1 drug to reach its peak effectiveness, indicating that VK2735’s ceiling hasn’t been reached yet. That said, the drug did have a relatively high dropout rate of 28%, with most related to gastrointestinal events like vomiting. Though GI symptoms are a common side effect of GLP-1 therapy, the discontinuation rate was higher than those &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183#:~:text=More%20participants%20in%20the%20semaglutide%20group%20than%20in%20the%20placebo%20group%20(7.0%25%20vs.%203.1%25)%20discontinued%20treatment%20owing%20to%20adverse%20events%20(mainly%20gastrointestinal%20events)%20(Table%203%20and%20Fig.%20S9)."&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; with other GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide, so it’s at least something to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The company is moving forward with its development of VK2735, having &lt;a href="https://ir.vikingtherapeutics.com/2025-06-25-Viking-Therapeutics-Announces-Initiation-of-Phase-3-Obesity-Clinical-Program-with-GLP-1-GIP-Agonist-VK2735"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; two Phase III trials last June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. MariTide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another potential rival to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk might come from Amgen’s MariTide, short for maridebart cafraglutide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MariTide has some intriguing differences compared to current drugs. It’s intended to be taken as an injection once a month, as opposed to the weekly injections required by current GLP-1s. The drug also takes a different chemical approach to treating obesity. While it still mimics GLP-1 activity, it also blocks the hormone GIP, in contrast to drugs like tirzepatide and VK2735, which mimic both GLP-1 and GIP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, this alternate approach appears promising. In &lt;a href="https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/06/results-from-amgens-phase-2-obesity-study-of-monthly-maritide-presented-at-the-american-diabetes-association-85th-scientific-sessions"&gt;Phase II clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, people with obesity have lost up to 20% of their weight over a year’s time while taking MariTide. People with type 2 diabetes also lost up to 17%, which is notable since people with diabetes typically lose substantially less weight on GLP-1 therapy than those without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Amgen is currently conducting several Phase III trials of MariTide. Should it eventually win approval, the drug could offer a more convenient option for some potential users while also illustrating that there’s more than one way to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Retatrutide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Retatrutide is being developed by Eli Lilly, and it might be the most hyped experimental drug seen so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In clinical trial data &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/eli-lillys-weight-loss-superdrug-worked-so-well-during-trials-some-quit-over-losing-too-much-2000698424"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last month, people with obesity and knee osteoarthritis taking retatrutide lost up to 71 pounds over 68 weeks’ time, or nearly 30% of their baseline weight. Those results appear to be the most impressive documented for any weight loss drug to date and come close to matching the average effectiveness seen with traditional bariatric surgeries. Users also experienced a substantial reduction in knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Retatrutide’s effectiveness likely stems from it mimicking not one, not two, but three hormones that regulate our hunger and metabolism at once: GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drug probably isn’t going to be for everyone. Some people might simply not need or want to lose that much weight, and there is some early evidence that the drug’s side effects might be a bit more intolerable than drugs like semaglutide. Still, given the sheer potential effectiveness on display here, retatrutide could certainly become the next big thing in weight loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly plans to release results from other Phase III studies of retatrutide in 2026, with an FDA approval likely not too far down the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Rejuva&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fractyl Health’s &lt;a href="https://www.fractyl.com/our-platforms/rejuva/"&gt;Rejuva&lt;/a&gt; isn’t as close to reaching the public as the other drugs mentioned so far. But it is the most futuristic-sounding option on the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an injectable gene therapy designed to boost the body’s own production of GLP-1, possibly for life. Early studies in mice have suggested that a single course of Rejuva might be able to match the benefits seen with other GLP-1-based drugs. The company also argues that Rejuva could be easier to tolerate, since the therapy would really only stimulate added production in response to food, as opposed to the high circulating levels of GLP-1 induced by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The company is developing Rejuva for type 2 diabetes and obesity, with its obesity therapy intended to boost both GLP-1 and GIP production. It’s &lt;a href="https://ir.fractyl.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fractyl-health-announces-potent-preclinical-results-rjva-002"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to start the first human trial of Rejuva, for people with poorly controlled diabetes, this year.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/excessive-sitting-raises-risk-of-early-death-now-we-know-how-much"&gt;Excessive sitting&lt;/a&gt; isn't good for a person's physical or mental health, but there's a type of sedentary activity that may not &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sitting-could-be-shrinking-your-brain-and-exercise-may-not-help"&gt;shrink our brains&lt;/a&gt; or cost our cognition to the same extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 85 studies has now found good reason to differentiate between 'active' sitting, like playing cards or reading, and 'passive' sitting, like watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former may actually boost brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's probably because active sitting engages the brain, whereas passive sitting lets a person take a back seat both physically and cognitively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-revealed-how-much-exercise-you-need-to-offset-sitting-all-day"&gt;Scientists Revealed How Much Exercise You Need to 'Offset' Sitting All Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Total sitting time has been shown to be related to brain health; however, sitting is often treated as a single entity, without considering the specific type of activity," &lt;a href="https://news.uq.edu.au/2026-01-not-all-sitting-same-when-it-comes-brain-health"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; public health researcher Paul Gardiner from the University of Queensland in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people spend many hours sitting each day, so the type of sitting really matters … These findings show that small everyday choices – like reading instead of watching television – may help keep your brain healthier as you age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-boosts-brain-function-across-all-ages-massive-study-confirms"&gt;exercise remains incredibly important&lt;/a&gt; for cognitive health, but giving your brain a workout is also important, and that doesn't necessarily mean you have to be on your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189878" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/people_playing_cards_642.jpg" alt="three men at a table playing a card game" class="wp-image-189878 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/people_playing_cards_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/people_playing_cards_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189878" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;'Active' sitting is better for your brain than passive forms of sitting. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGiNppUFiI/"&gt;Drs Producoes/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across numerous studies, Gardiner and colleagues found that active sitting activities, like reading, playing card games, and using a computer, showed "overwhelmingly positive associations with cognitive health, enhancing cognitive functions such as executive function, situational memory, and working memory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, passive sitting was most consistently associated with negative cognitive outcomes, including increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect sizes were small but significant. The study authors hope their results will help inform future health research and more nuanced health guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the researchers suggest guidelines should recognize the difference between passively watching TV and actively using a computer, and encourage people to take &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-snacks-throughout-your-day-have-real-health-benefits-study-finds"&gt;short breaks&lt;/a&gt; to stimulate their brains and move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review focused on studies of typical sedentary activities in natural settings, rather than structured programs designed to boost brain function, making it relevant to people's everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health advice could shift from simply saying 'sit less' to encouraging more mentally engaging activities while sitting," &lt;a href="https://news.uq.edu.au/2026-01-not-all-sitting-same-when-it-comes-brain-health"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; Gardiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could help people make easy, realistic changes that support long‑term brain health and potentially reduce dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251394751"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;After a year of ongoing &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-measles-outbreak-south-carolina-elimination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that have sickened more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2,400 people&lt;/a&gt;, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel," Abraham said. "We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That's their personal freedom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;about 10%&lt;/a&gt; of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically. This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-lives-vaccines-have-saved/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;prevent infection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and halt the virus's spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/measles-virus-outbreak-spread-genomic-analysis-elimination-status-cdc-rfk-us/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;scientists are examining&lt;/a&gt; whether the major outbreaks in &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-measles-outbreak-south-carolina-elimination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses — about 16,000 genetic letters long — to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public. Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. And that would mean that &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/estimating-the-financial-costs-of-measles-outbreaks" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;costly,&lt;/a&gt; potentially deadly, and preventable measles outbreaks could become common again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embed__float-wrap"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"When you hear somebody like Abraham say 'the cost of doing business,' how can you be more callous," said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an &lt;a href="https://rasmussenretorts.substack.com/p/one-year-in-how-the-trump-administration?utm_source=live-stream-redirect&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;online discussion&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the health blog &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/one-year-in-how-the-trump-administration" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 20. "Three people died of measles last year in this country," Offit added. "We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rate-decline-measles-polio-outbreaks/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/kindergarten-routine-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;have dropped&lt;/a&gt;. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;138,000 children,&lt;/a&gt; obtained &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccination-rates-kindergarteners-fall-exemptions-rise/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine exemptions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the 2024-25 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-autism-announcement-rfk-tylenol-pregnancy-vaccines/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;brain swelling, and death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration's focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country's measles-free status. "This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles," she said. "It's like they're trying to be graded on a curve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;impeded the CDC's ability&lt;/a&gt; to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/russell-vought-trump-omb-doge-public-health-budget-shutdown/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;slowed the release&lt;/a&gt; of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations. However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing. Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the CDC's genomic analyses show that last year's outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country's status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC's national immunization center, who &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-cdc-officials-resign-after-monarez-ouster-cite-concerns-over-scientific-independence/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;resigned in protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Kennedy's actions in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country's status: "They'll say, who cares."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/20/cdc-measles-briefing-lost-elimination-status-cost-of-doing-business/" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reporter from Stat&lt;/a&gt; that a reversal in the nation's status would not be significant: "Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;JoAnn Chesser, 89, passed away peacefully with family by her side at Diamond Willow, Proctor on January 16, 2026, after a long battle with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn lived a life grounded in kindness, service, and a deep commitment to her family and community. Guided by her faith and a lifelong dedication to helping others, JoAnn was deeply involved at St. Paul’s Episcopalian Church, volunteered at CHUM helped start the Rhubarb Festival, volunteered with Meals on Wheels, and was active in the Whole Foods Co-op community. Whether serving a meal, lending a hand, or sharing a warm smile, she touched countless lives through her generosity and compassion. JoAnn retired from St. Louis County as a social worker, after years of helping others.  She loved to cook and bake around the holidays. She would take the grandchildren on several camping trips where they learned all about “roughing it” and shared several stories over the campfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn is preceded in death by her parents, Milton and Vivian “Lulu” Haff; her brothers, John and Bob; and her sisters, Midgie and Mary Ann. Their memories remained close to her heart throughout her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A devoted mother and nurturing presence, JoAnn is survived by her sons, David (Ann) Chesser and Robert (Lori) Chesser. She also held a special place in her heart for her niece and nephew, Heidi and Brian (Nikki) Cagle, whom she helped raise and loved as her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn also leaves behind her sisters Sally, Judy and Lonetta, her sister-in-law Ann, several nieces and nephews, as well as many grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom she cherished deeply. She will be remembered for her gentle spirit, humor, and unwavering love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Visitation will be held on Friday Jan. 30, 2026, from 10AM until the 11AM Memorial Service in St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, 1710 E. Superior St., Duluth, MN 55812.  Arrangements by Dougherty Funeral Home.  JoAnn will be buried later this spring in Cross Lake, MN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JoAnn will be dearly missed, but her legacy of service, family devotion, and kindness will continue to shine through the lives she touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The family would like to thank the staff at Diamond Willow and Essentia Hospice for the care they gave JoAnn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In lieu of flowers the family asks that you make a donation in her name to The Alzheimer’s Association or Second Harvest Northland in hopes that the community will remember her as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

"I was unbearably tired, I would need to have a nap during the day which is not particularly normal… I complained that I was having really, really itchy skin.

Play now&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thursby said she thought the fatigue was simply due to her being a busy mom with a toddler and newborn baby at home. But in January 2025, she decided to see a doctor.  However, when she mentioned her symptoms, she said doctors “blamed it on her hormones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I listened to what the GP said and obviously didn't think anything else of it,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Months later, Thursby returned to her doctor after discovering a lump on her neck. They ultimately sent her for a CT scan and biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In October 2025, she received the “heartbreaking” diagnosis of stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/hodgkin-lymphoma/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, which can cause pain when drinking, fever, night sweats and feelings of lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I spoke to the blood cancer doctor, she said she's been working for 17 years and has only seen it one other time,” Thursby said. “But pain when you drink alcohol is actually a known side effect of Hodgkin lymphoma. 'It's something about the acidity in the wine and not when you drink other alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollie Thursby undergoing chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In November, Thrusby, a primary school teacher, started chemotherapy to treat her cancer, which she’ll continue in the coming months.

Usually, if you stop exposing yourself to the heat, the rash will slowly fade away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"But if you keep slow roasting yourself, it can actually cause damage to your skin and blood vessels and make that rash permanent. And in some cases, its even been linked to skin &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A lot of people presume they'd be left with a burn rather than a rash covering their skin if exposed to a direct source of heat, but that isn't the case with toasted skin syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Toni Golen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, explained why in an &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-toasted-skin-syndrome"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for Harvard Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The level of heat that triggers the rash isn’t high enough to burn you, but it can dilate superficial blood vessels under the skin," she said. That’s what causes the skin to discolour over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For those who might have been left with the strange rash after taking their hot water bottle sessions a bit too far this winter, Dr Golen suggested cooling it for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Exposing your skin to direct heat when using items such as a hot water bottle can cause the rash (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Lower the setting of your electric blanket or heating pad, or limit how long you use it," the doctor said. "If your laptop is the problem, place a lap desk or other buffer between it and your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The rash should fade over weeks. If it doesn’t, see your doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As Dr Golen mentioned, it really is important to check in with your GP if this rash doesn't disappear - as it might have triggered something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/toasted-skin-syndrome#complications"&gt;at&lt;/a&gt; Healthline have warned that exposing your skin to a heat source for long periods can sometimes 'cause more dramatic changes in your skin cells that can develop into other conditions, including cancer'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It states: "The types of cancer that are associated with toasted skin syndrome include: squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and cutaneous lymphoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"While cancer isn’t a common complication of toasted skin syndrome, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about any skin changes you notice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But if you want to avoid putting yourself at risk of toasted skin syndrome altogether, it sounds like simply sticking another layer on to stay warm might be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 18:25:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPYVZrZVRDWHpTOXdoSG01VUV2T00td3VQS3ZTT3hfQUNEZy1iNkxUSG8ya1h2NXluOXBfMWgxNUdEMTJ2QWpqNk1RbXN2M3JBeVZ5YzZ3MzF1djJNcjZvcjhmY2lMbV9qMmNZM1pFbzlzZ1FPa0tyc0ZvRmYwWThGVVRlYmk0T3lQWG5VVWFqOWZVY01aejNMdk43bFpuQlM5X1dIa3d0aTJOWWV6Wm5ORA</guid></item><item><title>这个可爱的好男孩刚刚接受了罕见的挽救生命的脑部手术- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-adorable-good-boy-just-got-rare-life-saving-brain-surgery-2000712485</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A six-year-old dog named Woody has just earned a new lease on life, thanks to a rare type of brain surgery performed by veterinarians in Portland, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surgeons at DoveLewis Animal Hospital conducted the surgery to remove a tumor in Woody’s skull. The complicated procedure took several hours to complete but was a success. And Woody has since recuperated well enough to get back to his daily walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The post-op recovery really takes a whole lot of people to work together, and watching him very closely, and to have a [committed] owner have the team to support his post-op and have him coming back for a recheck all these are necessary components for his success of outcome,” John Du, a neurosurgeon at DoveLewis, &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/dog-recovers-from-rare-complex-brain-surgery-at-portland-animal-hospital-dovelewis-dogs-veterinary-medicine"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; local media outlet KATU Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Rare and complex&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000712583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000712583" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2000712583 size-medium" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-189x336.jpg" alt="Woodytumor" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-189x336.jpg 189w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-720x1280.jpg 720w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-378x672.jpg 378w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-540x960.jpg 540w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor-900x1600.jpg 900w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/woodytumor.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000712583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;© DoveLewis Veterinary Emergency &amp;amp; Specialty Hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Woody’s owners first suspected something was wrong with Woody last summer when he began stumbling on stairs and hesitating before jumps. By November, doctors at DoveLewis had identified the cause: a bone tumor pressing up against his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Brain surgeries are some of the hardest procedures to perform in humans, and they can be even more challenging in dogs. The brain and skull structure of a dog can vary dramatically depending on its breed, and dogs &lt;a href="https://news.cvm.ncsu.edu/nc-state-neurologist-adapts-human-laser-therapy-for-use-in-dogs-with-brain-cancer/#:~:text=Another%20challenge%20was,through%20this%20muscle.%E2%80%9D"&gt;tend&lt;/a&gt; to have thicker muscles on their head than humans do, further complicating any incisions. So the surgery that saved Woody’s life was no easy feat, according to his doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The major risk we were worried about was the tumor was very close to a few major blood vessels around the skull and it took about four to six hours, I believe, in total to be removed safely,” Du told KATU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the procedure—which included rebuilding part of Woody’s skull with a titanium mesh—went well without any serious hitches. Woody was carefully monitored afterward but was on his feet and able to go back home by day three. Now he’s back to his old self, walking every day and playing with his brother.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Woody’s tumor isn’t completely gone, unfortunately, but his doctors say it’s a slow-growing tumor. With ongoing monitoring and care, the family is hopeful that Woody will have many more years of life left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only complex canine surgery that doctors at DoveLewis have performed as of late.

							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some older folks seem to radiate joy while others appear weighed down by their years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week at the farmers' market where I volunteer, I watched a 74-year-old vendor practically dance between the stalls, cracking jokes with customers and helping younger vendors lift heavy crates. Meanwhile, his friend, roughly the same age, sat hunched on a bench complaining about everything from the weather to his knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the difference? After years of observing and talking with the happiest seniors I know, I've discovered it's not about luck or genetics. The vibrant ones all share certain daily habits that keep their spirits high and their outlook fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't complicated rituals or expensive treatments. They're simple, intentional choices anyone can make. And the best part? You don't have to wait until you're 70 to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They move their bodies every single morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, "Of course exercise is on this list." But here's what surprised me: the happiest seniors don't necessarily do intense workouts. They just move, consistently, first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 78-year-old I know starts each day with a 15-minute walk around her block. Rain or shine. Another does gentle stretches while his coffee brews. A third tends her garden before breakfast, bending and reaching as she checks on her tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key isn't the type of movement but the timing. Morning movement sets a positive tone for the entire day. As someone who runs trails most mornings, I can vouch for this. Even on days when I only manage a quick walk, that early movement shifts my whole mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up too. Studies show that morning exercise &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432823005090"&gt;boosts mood-regulating neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; for hours afterward. But more than science, it's about starting the day by honoring your body instead of ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They practice gratitude without making it a chore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to roll my eyes at gratitude practices. Seemed too woo-woo for my analytical brain. Then I started keeping an evening gratitude journal, mostly out of curiosity, and something shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest older people I know have mastered this art. But they don't make it complicated. One gentleman tells me he thinks of three good things while brushing his teeth each night. Another writes one sentence in a notebook she keeps on her nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me is how specific they get. Not just "grateful for family" but "grateful for my granddaughter's giggle when she saw the butterfly today." This specificity trains the brain to notice small joys throughout the day, knowing you'll want to remember them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They maintain real connections, not just Facebook friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something interesting: the happiest seniors I meet aren't necessarily the ones with the most friends. They're the ones who nurture a handful of deep connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 72-year-old regular at the farmers' market told me she has coffee with the same three friends every Tuesday. They've been meeting for 15 years. Another couple in their late 70s hosts a monthly potluck where the same six people always show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality beats quantity every time. These folks pick up the phone instead of just texting. They show up in person when someone needs help. They remember birthdays and anniversaries without Facebook reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I helped my parents downsize recently, we found boxes of handwritten letters from friends spanning decades. That kind of connection takes effort, but it pays dividends in happiness and belonging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They learn something new without pressure to master it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 75-year-old who just started learning Spanish isn't trying to become fluent. The 71-year-old taking pottery classes isn't aiming to sell her work. They're learning for the sheer joy of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach to learning keeps the brain flexible and curious. But more importantly, it maintains that childlike wonder that makes life feel fresh instead of repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One woman told me she picks a new topic each month to explore through library books and YouTube videos. Last month was birds of prey. This month it's the history of jazz. She'll never be an expert in any of these areas, and that's precisely the point. The joy is in the exploration, not the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They have a purpose beyond themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every happy senior I know contributes to something larger than their own life. For some, it's volunteering. For others, it's mentoring younger people in their former profession. Many care for grandchildren or tend community gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My weekly volunteer shift at the farmers' market connects me with several retirees who show up religiously to help set up tents and educate customers about local produce. One 76-year-old told me, "Retirement without purpose is just waiting around. I need to know I'm still useful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of purpose doesn't have to be grand. It could be as simple as being the neighbor who waters plants when others travel, or the person who organizes the building's recycling program. What matters is feeling needed and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They protect their sleep like gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest older adults I know treat sleep as sacred, not negotiable. They have bedtime routines they stick to religiously. They skip late-night TV binges. They say no to evening events that would disrupt their schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particularly vibrant 73-year-old told me she's been going to bed at 9:30 PM and waking at 5:30 AM for the past decade. "People think I'm missing out on nightlife," she laughed. "But I'm gaining energy for the life that actually matters to me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep becomes even more crucial as we age. It affects everything from mood to memory to physical recovery. The seniors who prioritize it consistently report feeling younger and more energetic than their sleep-deprived peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They laugh at themselves regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice I didn't say they're always happy or positive. The healthiest seniors I know experience the full range of emotions. But they've mastered the art of not taking themselves too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they forget someone's name, they laugh about their "senior moment" instead of panicking about cognitive decline. When they struggle with new technology, they joke about being dinosaurs rather than feeling ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This self-deprecating humor serves a purpose beyond entertainment. It releases tension, connects them with others, and keeps perfectionism at bay. Speaking of perfectionism, finding my old report cards while helping my parents move reminded me how exhausting it is to take yourself too seriously all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They say no without guilt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be the most powerful habit of all. Happy seniors have earned the right to be selective with their time and energy, and they use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decline invitations that don't excite them. They refuse to babysit when they're tired. They skip family drama they don't want to engage with. And they do it all without lengthy explanations or apologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 70-year-old told me, "I spent 50 years saying yes to everything. Now I only say yes to what brings me joy or truly helps someone I love. Everything else gets a polite no."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't selfishness. It's self-preservation. By protecting their energy for what truly matters, they have more to give when they do say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father had his heart attack at 68, it shook me to my core. Watching him recover, I saw firsthand how daily habits can make the difference between merely surviving and truly thriving in our later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about these eight habits? You can start them at any age. I'm in my forties and already practicing most of them. They've made me happier now, not just preparing me for a happier future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seniors who seem to have cracked the code on aging joyfully aren't lucky or special. They've simply figured out that feeling young has less to do with denying age and more to do with engaging fully with each day. They move, connect, learn, contribute, rest, laugh, and choose. Every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if you picked just one of these habits to start tomorrow? My guess is you'd feel a little younger by next week.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a very important study, and in my follow-up tests, we already saw a significant regression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-19" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;In 2022, Israel’s National Cancer Registry recorded 3,335 new patients.
