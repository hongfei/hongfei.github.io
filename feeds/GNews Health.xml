A second, larger outbreak occurred in Bomate village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Preliminary investigations traced the outbreak to three children who in January ate a bat and died.

&lt;p&gt;Talk about a heavy dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the bulk of news coverage is focused on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/studies-show-ozempic-can-lower-risk-of-depression/"&gt;GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; that cause weight loss, licensed pharmacist &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/your.fav.pharmacist?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&amp;amp;ltsid=85fd47af-8fa3-4c9a-a002-d9eba061f219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes&lt;/a&gt; has spotlighted six medications “that’ll low-key or high-key make you fat or make you gain weight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surprising is an over-the-counter drug that’s incredibly popular for allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes says six medications are notorious for causing weight gain. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;highwaystarz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Benadryl&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Histamine, a chemical in our immune system involved in allergic response, also decreases appetite.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, according to the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/blog/antihistamines-and-weight-gain-obesity-medicine-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;, “it makes sense an antihistamine would have the opposite effect” and can “interfere with the ‘I’m full’ signal … and lead to overeating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Post, Forbes notes that first-generation antihistamines like Benadryl and cyproheptadine — which is also used as an appetite stimulant — can cause weight gain, particularly with long-term or continued usage.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Paroxetine (Paxil)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Paroxetine (Paxil), an antidepressant, is one of the more sedating SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) used for depression, anxiety/OCD, etc.,” said Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SSRIs increase levels of the “feel-good” chemical serotonin in the brain, and Forbes calls Paxil one of the worst offenders when it comes to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes’s insights on the relationship between antidepressants and weight gain come amid &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/antidepressant-prescriptions-increasing-young-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;growing antidepressant use&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young adults and teens.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that about 14% of US adults take an antidepressant. The Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute (HPHCI) notes that people often stop using the drug if they experience weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several psychiatrists in major New York hospitals told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2002/10/20/darker-side-to-the-911-wonder-pill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; they avoid prescribing Paxil as it causes more weight gain and sexual dysfunction than similar drugs — and has the worst withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;doucefleur – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Mirtazepine&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. Those with major depressive disorder may be prescribed higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We specifically try to avoid this in patients who are overweight,” explained Forbes. She noted that the same medicine is given to animals as an appetite stimulant to increase body weight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Kocsis, a professor and psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, previously told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/25/antidepressants-linked-to-the-obesity-epidemic-study/"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; that Remeron (Mirtazapine) “is known to cause weight gain frequently because its anti-histaminic effect makes users sluggish.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@your.fav.pharmacist/video/7287798908095368479" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;related TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Forbes recommends trazodone as a better, less appetite-amplifying substitute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics can pump up the plump. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tiktok/@your.fav.pharmacist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Second-generation antipsychotics&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459150/#:~:text=Neuroleptics%2C%20also%20known%20as%20antipsychotic,generation%20or%20%22atypical%22%20antipsychotics." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Antipsychotics&lt;/a&gt;, also known as neuroleptics, are used to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. These meds are categorized into two classes — first-generation or “typical” antipsychotics and second-generation or “atypical” antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics, especially Zyprexa and Seroquel, can pump up the plump. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The weight gain over a year can be massive, up to 30 to 50 pounds for some patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotics affect neuropeptides, the signaling molecules associated with appetite control and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the antipsychotic drug class, Forbes notes that weight gain is linked to antihistamine activity and serotonin 2C antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seven different types of serotonin receptors,” she said. “Specifically, 2C is where we get that side effect, the antagonism or blockade of that receptor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Dronabinol&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dronabinol is a synthetic THC used to treat and stimulate appetite in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;address anorexia and weight loss in adult HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Insulin &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insulin pushes glucose into cells vs. the bloodstream,” Forbes expounds. “These are not to be confused with meds like Ozempic/Mounjaro/Trulicity, etc., which are not insulins but also injected and refrigerated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insulin works by aiding the cellular absorption of glucose. However, when the cells absorb too much glucose, the body converts it into fat, leading to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes, who also makes &lt;a href="https://yourfavpharmacist.myshopify.com/products/body-ody-body-butter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lip balm and body butter&lt;/a&gt;, has previously &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/17/health/pharmacist-reveals-whats-her-cold-and-flu-medicine-cabinet-must-haves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shared the essential meds&lt;/a&gt; she keeps in her medicine cabinet to combat symptoms during cold and flu season and the surprising &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/20/health/why-your-stool-softener-isnt-helping-you-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;way you can repurpose ineffective stool softeners. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., said the situation was “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We have measles outbreaks every year,” he added. Mr. Kennedy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-anti-vax.html" title=""&gt;has also said in the past&lt;/a&gt; that immunizations against measles and some other infectious diseases are unnecessary and risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Public health experts said that while it’s true we do have measles cases in the United States every year, the latest outbreak is concerning because of its size, because a child has died and because larger outbreaks like this are becoming more frequent as vaccination rates decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“While we certainly see measles cases from time to time, it’s a rarity that we see an unfolding outbreak of this scale,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. At least 164 people have been sickened with measles so far this year.

&lt;p&gt;Cook, along with Lubbock's director of public health, Katherine Wells, said they see no end in sight for the outbreak, which now spans nine counties in Texas, many of which have low vaccination rates. "This outbreak is going to continue to grow," Wells said, declining to forecast how high the final case count could go after a reporter raised the possibility of several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 116 of the 146 cases are under the age of 18, with 46 being between the ages of 0 and 4. Only five of the 146 were vaccinated with at least one dose of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Wells reported that the outbreak has seemed to sway some vaccine-hesitant parents to get their children vaccinated. Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. "Which is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in the outbreak, which erupted in late January, messaging about the disease and the importance of vaccination has exclusively come from state and local authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;a brief statement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday, which was not sent through the agency's press distribution list. It did, however, note that "vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a cabinet meeting Wednesday, US Health Secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, offering a variety of inaccurate information. Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, falsely claiming that "it's not unusual." But, this is an unusual year for measles in the US. As epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted on Bluesky, the number of US measles cases this year has already &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h"&gt;surpassed the total case counts from eight of the previous 15 years&lt;/a&gt;. And it is only February.&lt;/p&gt;

described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the

fezwLZ"&gt;The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave last week&lt;/a&gt;, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0

The infected traveler was an infant returning home to Orange County after international travel, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-0" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County Health Care Agency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a viral infection that spreads through the air and via droplets. It can potentially lead to serious health consequences, including death. It can spread when an infected person breaths, coughs or sneezes or by touching an infected surface, according to&lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt; John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;said, you can get measles just by being in a room where the infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest number of cases and the&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt; first death from the disease since 2015&lt;/a&gt; — an unvaccinated child — have occurred in rural west Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the uptick in cases is caused by an overall &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-27/as-measles-cases-mount-in-the-us-whats-the-situation-worldwide"&gt;decline in measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious that at least 95% of a community needs to be immunized to prevent it from spreading. In the U.S. most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergarten-age children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers and airport staff who were at Terminal B — which serves flights for Air China, Air France, All Nippon Airways, British Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways, among others — on Feb. 19 between 1 and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible exposure site includes specific seats on the Korean Airline flight. Potentially exposed passengers can expect to be contacted by their local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County Health Officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise that you confirm whether you’ve been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not had measles in the past and have not yet received the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease if you’ve been exposed, according to county public health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal where the infected traveler passed through you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or are unimmunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-would-it-take-for-signs-of-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;How long would it take for signs of symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;What are symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days. Health officials say the rash lasts between five and six days before fading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection can result in severe complications, including blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections, trouble breathing due to pneumonia and, in some cases, death, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults,” Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for complications to occur in children under 5 and adults over the age of 30, according to public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-the-measles" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against the measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 20:30:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNVlFfLU8wRmYycktVeVZUN0hoeWo4QmxiR2Z0azg2bXViR2FheW1TRkpxTDBpMmZuWGJrNldlc0lJOVo3emUwMUlWX2tIdXRZM29SWTR4U0UxdW9aSldKTGoxaVRnUnJnV1NYR2hnLWV0YU1Nc3laay1PV0Z3MUdMTzhwamdKc0U2c3BLZVlfVXFQUXU2U001ek9JR25vSXd5Y251elIyRkUtb3E1bGc2bnVUblRvR0pJVW9lZ0RJUWtwaVhGMjQtLTduWDBHWWl2MXdF</guid></item><item><title>N.J. cat euthanized after bird flu infection.

Now there are growing worries about next year’s flu vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the Food and Drug Administration — now with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm — unexpectedly and without reason canceled a March meeting of scientists who advise the FDA on vaccine policy. A similar meeting at the Centers for Disease Control was postponed last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, the head of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, joined Morning Edition host Cathy Wurzer to talk about the implications of axing the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_timelines_for_flu_vaccines_are_tight._why_do_cancellations_of_these_march_meetings_matter%3F_"&gt;Timelines for flu vaccines are tight. Why do cancellations of these March meetings matter? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes about six months for the virus that scientists use for the vaccine to grow. It’s then available in late summer or early fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like planting a garden,” Osterholm said. “If you postpone it two months, you might be in trouble when you can harvest, and if you can harvest it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline is already tight to make an educated estimation on what flu strains will be a problem next year, and the virus can change between now and then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this is our best guess and our best attempt to give us the best match for the virus circulating next winter and what’s in the vaccine,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_since_the_vaccine_is_often_grown_in_chicken_eggs%2C_could_bird_flu_affect_development%3F_"&gt;Since the vaccine is often grown in chicken eggs, could bird flu affect development? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no. And Osterholm said this is some good news among the bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right after 9/11, when we had so many concerns about terrorism and so forth happening, the U.S. government took extra effort, along with the vaccine manufacturers, to secure the facilities where these chickens actually lay the eggs,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eggs used by scientists are embryonated, meaning they’re fertilized and growing a fetal chicken. The chickens are raised under tight biosecurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The buildings are airtight with special filters,” Osterholm explained. “And so we feel pretty confident that even if a H5N1 situation is occurring in the region where these egg-producing locations are at, we’re still in really good shape.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_the_vaccines_be_manufactured_without_fda_or_cdc_panel_guidance%3F_"&gt;Can the vaccines be manufactured without FDA or CDC panel guidance? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panels evaluate what’s been happening with the flu in the southern hemisphere. The strains circulating there typically predict what’s likely to happen in the U.S. four to five months later, according to Osterholm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And without those kind of data, we can’t do that,” he said. “It’s not just something casually done saying, ‘Ah, let’s just go with that one, OK?’ Now there really is a major effort made to come up with the closest match we can. So this timing and the meetings themselves are very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_if_the_federal_government_scales_back_mass_vaccination%2C_how_could_people_still_get_shots%3F_"&gt;If the federal government scales back mass vaccination, how could people still get shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we are really in the worst place I’ve been in my 50-year career in terms of vaccine preventable diseases,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several state governments, in line with Kennedy, are increasingly identifying as anti-vaccine. For example, the Surgeon General of Louisiana recently issued a statement saying the state department of health no longer supports vaccine campaigns for children — and for parents that want them, to seek immunizations out independently. In Texas and New Mexico, there’s a worsening outbreak of measles, which the U.S. declared eliminated back in 2000. However, dropping rates of MMR vaccines for kids are bringing the disease out of the shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there is this ever-creeping concern coming into the vaccine picture of people who are not getting vaccinated,” Osterholm continued. “We have a real battle on our hands right now in terms of helping the public understand what will happen if they’re not vaccinating their kids. What this means is this is not without a consequence. So you may think you’re making a moral choice. We're also making a choice that can end up killing your child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm also pointed out that federal governments in the past have been a leader in the discussion, calling it “unfortunate” that it’s not the present case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_states_continue_vaccine_programs_if_the_federal_government_stops_dispersing_shots%3F_"&gt;Can states continue vaccine programs if the federal government stops dispersing shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ meeting was canceled recently. When the group makes a recommendation on vaccines, it’s affirmed by the CDC and triggers a sequence of events, including covering child vaccination programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without that, you basically don’t have a mechanism for paying for these vaccines, and so it’s a much larger issue than just telling parents that this is a good thing to do,” Osterholm explained. “It also makes the wheels of public health turn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many state and local health departments in the U.S. have immunization programs largely supported by federal dollars. Osterholm is concerned that there’ll be a mass reduction in these programs under the Trump Administration. He also expects hefty layoffs at the CDC in the coming weeks, which will directly impact local health programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole system right now is devolving into, frankly, a black hole,” he said. “I am incredibly, incredibly concerned that we’re going to see a major erosion in [vaccination] for children in this country over the next year or two, and it will absolutely result in major outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_are_you_worried_about_pandemic_readiness%2C_should_one_occur%3F_"&gt;Are you worried about pandemic readiness, should one occur? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has to understand the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is,” Osterholm warned, underlining there will be more pandemics — and they could be worse than COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we prepared for this? Absolutely not,” he said. “We have so many lessons that should have and could have been learned from what we went through with COVID that no one really ever took the time in federal governments or organizations to really review that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I fear that we’re going to go into the next pandemic… not any better prepared,” Osterholm continued. “But more importantly, we have a public now that distrusts public health unlike any time in modern history.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNdHBwU2lTelRBODBjcG1hTUV4UXljbmJlVWE1WWtfaXBaT2VJM2FzTTV0cnJnRmNvNmZULXg0bzNxOFp6M2Jkel8xNS1UcmhySnN0NDhZU1lQRTJtMVlpblZPckFNeHJ3Rjh5WUc5dzIwbzI3RjMwQi1VR2Z5WDJBSWNPR2xLTnFQSUVFMC15U25SWklTMkFoV05nM2N4VUhQS1dWSEZoVml2VzNISzZlTjN6bw</guid></item><item><title>In Texas Measles Outbreak, Signs of a Riskier Future for Children - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0zOG9aemVMeTRpcmtkVjFtQzFTZlJDbm1GU2RhZ19uX29YWFcwZVhQVHVtWmo3bUZoZkdqeG1BcE5xTWh2NUpXR29rTnZoMllucWlXcmJPRjNZSTZUbnE0WTNqLUwxTnRUMGRjd05DYURNa2pLcHRv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Every day, as Dr. Wendell Parkey enters his clinic in Seminole, a small city on the rural western edge of Texas, he announces his arrival to the staff with an anthem pumping loudly through speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As the song reaches a climax, he throws up an arm and strikes a pose in cowboy boots. “Y’all ready to stomp out disease?” he asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Recently, the question has taken on a dark urgency. Seminole Memorial Hospital, where Dr. Parkey has practiced for nearly three decades, has found itself at the center of the largest measles outbreak in the United States since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Since last month, more than 140 Texas residents, most of whom live in the surrounding Gaines County, have been diagnosed and 20 have been hospitalized.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz8xk3001j26qm9kg0dper@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two long-planned vaccine meetings — one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration — have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9dv9x000m3b6mgnj45ezk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The February meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed “to accommodate public comment,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to a note&lt;/a&gt; online. The three-day meeting,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/chikungunya-vaccine-cdc-investigating-hospitalizations/index.html"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt; and mpox. It also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;included two votes&lt;/a&gt; related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldn’t otherwise be able to pay for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9g3q1000r3b6m9h2mll6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. There’s no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and it’s unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o6vzxd00093b6mby8kqx71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html"&gt;FDA canceled&lt;/a&gt; a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fall’s flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9c0kl000g3b6m88ej5gxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didn’t indicate whether it would seek its advisers’ guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9i2up000t3b6m6cy8pdob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,” the statement said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x00022e6blfkv1l3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uncertainty around the government’s process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/health/flu-season-hospitalizations-mrsa-ane/index.html"&gt;brutal flu season&lt;/a&gt; and experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html"&gt;resurgence of measles&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x00032e6bfequg2s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9rh0r00193b6mpfw0oa50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/politics/rfk-jr-financial-interest-wisner-baum-lawsuits/index.html"&gt;made money from law firms &lt;/a&gt;that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;incorrectly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stated that 97% of the members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/ACIP-conflicts-interest-policy.pdf#:~:text=A%20conflict%20of%20interest%20exists%20when%20a,that%20vaccine%2C%20or%20of%20a%20competing%20vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;strict policies&lt;/a&gt; to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9e4ip000p3b6m3niaazty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Members of FDA’s vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9l5qv00153b6mzkhhkw33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-frieden_among-the-many-myths-circulating-about-vaccines-activity-7300602853784465408-t0Db?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAACwoZkBElUwSIV2Ynw-2W8V_lyGmfKbibE" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the “most damaging” falsehoods about vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7okus6400002e6bmdqbu9fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ovctto00052e6bwvkbo7by@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oq2cj600002e6bi66kgqde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really think that this is classic misinformation,” Frieden told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oa48fa001j3b6mr2uzbalz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-frieden_making-america-healthier-the-administration-activity-7298578744196141057-Bz1y/" target="_blank"&gt;a recent post on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Here’s the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaj58x00253b6myoy9fi3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on people’s ability to access them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oannto002c3b6mp0en084w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. “If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oapzw4002g3b6m05q39ik4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a February 20 &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the “prompt rescheduling” of the ACIP meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaqr8a002j3b6mr5r0ws92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oatn1c002m3b6m6ev1xsu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7obgbkx00003b6m2vzyutro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the most common&lt;/a&gt; is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs — a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7obquud00053b6miceo530q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctor’s offices and pharmacies in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000h2e6bjt3hjy0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob4uk700353b6m2xice34r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system/who-collaboration-center-erl" target="_blank"&gt;a network of&lt;/a&gt; seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p106fn00002e6b0eadc0mj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The US did participate in this meeting,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p15i5h00042e6bzagg9e08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that there’s a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system that’s in place.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob6bhl003b3b6m1wfoqpnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ozk1va00002e6bqx3oepz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-02-2025-recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccine-composition-for-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;WHO announced&lt;/a&gt; the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p0cyop00002e6bk7nr2ova@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,” said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000n2e6b1icp9h1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisers’, although they generally align.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000o2e6bnmg35uqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, there won’t be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didn’t specify how it would come to a decision or when.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000p2e6bydwabril@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,” said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaxfrs002u3b6mhjkt7n5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldn’t break their stride.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob47e5002z3b6mv1o2ogb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,” wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob4hh300323b6mp6w3rcb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000r2e6bsaioq01t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.org’s Tan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000s2e6blbojg9gq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,” Tan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oltkbi00032e6bpr42aqat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised “radical transparency” at HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onjm6a00092e6br3a5wwbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Public health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onluyi000c2e6bstf5zl5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000u2e6bprmnc1ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDA’s VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onwp14000j2e6bmwfd8smv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the government’s vaccine decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000v2e6blxl5qrew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,” Perlman told CNN’s Meg Tirrell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000w2e6b6t6ongm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000x2e6b7xpjicrn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s kind of taking experts out of the conversation,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Many of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.”

            The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHO’s recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.

&lt;p&gt;The study will trial the use of double immunotherapy. In some patients, double immunotherapy will be combined with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be handing the baton to &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/"&gt;Dr Jim Whittle&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.&lt;/p&gt;

and the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new report, Greek doctors detailed another case in Athens involving a gay man who attended an STI clinic with an itchy rash on his buttocks, abdomen and armpit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharing the tale in a medical journal, they said the 36-year-old tested positive for TMVII but even with treatment only 'showed a gradual but slow improvement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of the contagious infection dubbed a 'potential public health threat' have been on the rise in recent years, with it now being found in people after sexual contact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a new report, Greek doctors detailed another case in Athens involving a man who had had sex with his male partner and attended hospital with an itchy rash on his buttock, abdomen and armpit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes just months after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14043235/untreatable-genital-super-fungus-France-spreading-Britain.html"&gt;experts told this website&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;span&gt;the condition, which often causes painful rashes, was 'very likely' to be spreading undetected in Britain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab tests to confirm cases of the 'slow growing bug' can take up to three weeks for results to come back, they warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition itself can lurk in the body for days before causing tell-tale symptoms, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing the new case, medics at Andreas Syngros Hospital of Venereal and Dermatological Diseases, said the patient had ring-shaped lesions on the skin and small, pus-filled, inflamed bumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar lesions had recently appeared on his partner, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors carried out tests for syphilis as well as a fungal culture, the latter of which confirmed the presence of TMVII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qjmed/hcaf049/8015625?login=true"&gt;QJM: An International Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the medics said: 'T&lt;span&gt;he patient was further questioned about his recent travel history or contact with domestic animals and revealed that his partner had traveled to North Africa one month prior to the appearance of the rash.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes as US health officials in June confirmed one man in New York had become the first ever to contract the infection via sex in the US. Pictured, patient A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He was prescribed terbinafine and flutrimazole, antifungal medications typically used to treat fungal nail infections and ringworm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, a follow-up appointment three weeks later his skin showed 'no improvement' and he was switched to powerful antifungal medication itraconazole. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The patient was subsequently re-evaluated every two weeks showing gradual but slow improvement,' doctors said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six weeks of treatment, the rash had cleared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Physicians should remain vigilant in recognising and reporting cases of this emerging pathogen,' they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;TMVII is hypothesized to be transmitted from human-to-human through sexual contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Evidence supporting this transmission mode includes the typical localisation of the initial lesions in the genital or gluteal areas, and the higher incidence of cases among groups engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors, such as men who have sex with men.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Then in November, US health officials also reported that a further three cases had been detected in the city. Pictured, patient B &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then in November, US health officials also reported that a further three cases had been detected in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as US health officials in June confirmed one man in New York had become the first ever to contract the infection via sex in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He previously travelled to England, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/greece/index.html" id="mol-f6f8f4b0-f5d3-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-8f4154b0-f5d4-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and said he had sexual encounters during his trips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not fatal, TMVII can leave sufferers with permanent scarring or pigmentation on areas of the skin that were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New York researchers warned the rashes experienced by people infected with this type of ringworm may also present differently than the more common ringworm and could be mistaken for eczema, leaving patients without relief for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Denning, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Manchester, told MailOnline it was 'very likely that there are undetected cases' in the UK, 'particularly those in the early stages'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Today if you had a rash on your chest or your back, you might not bother to deal with it for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you were to go to a doctor and they prescribe something like a steroid or antibacterial cream but it doesn't work, we could be looking at six to eight weeks since it began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'It's likely no more transmissable than other skin fungi but it is very inflammatory meaning you get a much worse rash and usual treatments don't work.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also cautioned 'very long waiting lists' for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-8f3ac500-f5d4-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; dermatology treatment and 'long waits' for PCR test results could see at risk patients waiting weeks before the infection is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The Texas Department of Health and Human Services has released the latest number of measles cases confirmed as the state continues to battle an outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, the state reported that 146 cases in nine counties have been identified since late January. Twenty of the patients have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest update comes two days after the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;first death was reported&lt;/a&gt; in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. Officials said the child was not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has been the largest in the state in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mmr-vaccine-homeschooling-b29d08d53cf26704968e8c00dfa712ba"&gt;nearly 30 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state and Lubbock health officials confirmed the death to The Associated Press. The child wasn't identified but was treated at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, though the facility noted the patient didn't live in Lubbock County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a big deal,” Dr. Amy Thompson, a pediatrician and chief executive officer of Covenant Health, said Wednesday at a news conference. “We have known that we have measles in our community, and we are now seeing a very serious consequence.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In federal response, RFK Jr. appears to misstate several facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services is watching cases and dismissed the Texas outbreak as “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeared to misstate a number of facts, including a claim that most who had been hospitalized were there only for “quarantine.” Dr. Lara Johnson at Covenant contested that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,” said Johnson, the chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also seemed to misspeak in saying two people had died of measles. A spokesman — Andrew Nixon, for the Department of Health and Human Services — later clarified that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified only one death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government is providing vaccines as well as technical and laboratory support in West Texas, but the state health department is leading the response, Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC has said it will provide only weekly updates on the measles outbreak, and had not yet updated its public webpage to reflect the child’s death. Texas health department data shows that a majority of the reported measles cases are in children.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In rural Texas, some patients have needed oxygen or intubation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has largely spread among rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas, with cases concentrated in a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad"&gt;“close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt;, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County, which has reported 80 cases so far, has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 measles patients have been hospitalized at Covenant, including the outbreak's first identified case, hospital officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients' respiratory issues progressed to bacterial pneumonia, and they needed an oxygen tube to breathe, Johnson told The Associated Press. Others had to be intubated, though Johnson declined to say how many due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, like so many viruses, there aren’t any specific treatments for measles,” she said. “What we’re doing is providing supportive care, helping support the patients as they hopefully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said through a spokesman that his office is in regular communication with the state health department and epidemiologists, and that vaccination teams are in the “affected area.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The state will deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,” said spokesman Andrew Mahaleris, calling the child's death a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Wednesday, the state health department confirmed a new measles case in Rockwall County, east of Dallas. The person had traveled internationally and is not related to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines are safe and effective, and measles was once considered eliminated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccinations-kindergarten-exemptions-cdc-1c0f9a196a70491fccf48b9125090de0"&gt;95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases, despite promises not to change it during his confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had considered measles — a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours — eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-chicago-migrant-shelter-cdc-e58517c830f73e42266d45d45983c12b"&gt;sickened more than 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current outbreak, Lubbock’s first case was in an unvaccinated child who sat in an emergency room with a kid who had measles, said Katherine Wells, director of the local health department, calling it a testament to how quickly the virus spreads.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you see it in real life, you really realize how contagious it is,” said Wells, noting she expects more local cases, with a couple under investigation as of Wednesday. “An entire household gets sick so quickly. Whole families are getting sick with measles.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Suspected victims of a new and alarming condition linked to Covid jabs have shared how it has left them unemployed, homeless and even relying on antidepressants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another victim told this website how they'd even been forced to take powerful antidepressants to cope with suspected PVS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she started experiencing tinnitus, one of the suspected signs of the condition, the day after her first Covid jab in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never having had any tinnitus symptoms prior to the vaccine, I have always believed this must have been the cause,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that the never-ending pulsing in her ears has had a devastating impact on her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was prescribed antidepressants as I found this so unbearably difficult to cope with and still to this day I have sleepless nights and anxiety,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous victims shared how they felt they had been 'fobbed off' or 'dismissed' by medics when they linked their problems to a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No one wants to know about it... they've left people to rot,' one said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people claiming to have PVS said their symptoms had developed almost instantly after receiving the shot whilst others felt it build-up more gradually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which was not peer-reviewed but published on website MedRxiv, could be seen as controversial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One told MailOnline they had developed persistent tinnitus six-hours after their third Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spent over 12 months on an NHS audiology waiting list, only to be dismissed and told it was merely a coincidence due to my part-time work as a sound engineer,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added how the constant tinnitus, which can take the form of ringing, buzzing or hissing, now dominated his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I struggle with sleep, frequently need to ask people to repeat themselves, and find that the only way I can concentrate at work is by constantly listening to music to drown out the incessant noise,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many who contacted this website he said he had felt 'coerced' into getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I didn't get them, I would have been fired, as there was no place for me in the small office with non-existent social distancing. Being a new starter, I felt I had no choice but to comply,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the patients who suspect they have PVS told MailOnline directly that were not against vaccines in general, noting that they have saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added that a general failure from experts to acknowledge their experiences of adverse reactions had eroded trust in the health system, an attitude that could put the success of future vaccine programmes at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PVS is still a poorly understood condition, with even the Yale experts who unveiled their findings emphasizing the research is 'still a work in progress'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It should also be noted that many of the PVS's symptoms are relatively common ailments and can be caused by numerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, there is currently no way to prove if they are caused by a vaccine or are simply unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind Yale paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which has not yet peer-reviewed by independent experts, could be seen as controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that they will keep studying the condition in an effort to bring affected patients 'better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent experts, however, have urged for caution over the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on X, Dr Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard University, also said: 'There's nothing wrong with studying vaccine side effects. There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid jabs, like any vaccine or medical product, can cause side effects which can vary in frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But mRNA vaccines are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid, 1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, newly released data show 18,551 claims for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by Covid vaccines have been made in Britain as of last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These figures relate to the Government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only just over 200 of these claims have been deemed eligible for the sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been widely criticised for requiring patients to be at least 60 per cent disabled by their injuries in order to qualify for a payout — for example losing a limb, a sense like your sight, or complete paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 11,000 with an outcome about 450 were dismissed because while medics agreed a person had been injured by the jab, the case did not meet the 60 per cent disability and therefore the applicant got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remainder were unsuccessful because assessors found that, on the balance of probabilities, their injury or condition had not been caused by a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A further 7,000 or so applications are still awaiting an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms can include memory loss, such as recent events and conversations, confusion, language problems, and mood changes among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As the devastating disease damages parts of the brain, it gradually shrinks in a process called brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alzheimer’s is also thought to be caused by the abnormal build up of proteins in and around brain cells. One of the proteins involved is called amyloid and deposits of this protein form plaques around brain cells, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/causes/"&gt;as per&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It is not known exactly what causes this process to begin, however, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/science"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; know that it starts many years before symptoms appear and can be caused by a combination of factors, including genetics and ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Scientists have long been searching for a cure for Alzheimer's disease (TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And now, it has been suggested that Alzheimer's may not be a brain disease after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Science magazine &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in July 2022 that a key research paper published in the journal Nature that identified a subtype of brain protein called beta-amyloid as the cause of Alzheimer’s could have been based on fabricated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Donald Weaver, professor of chemistry and director of Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, at the University of Toronto wrote an article on this topic for The Conversation, and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://theconversation.com/alzheimers-might-not-be-primarily-a-brain-disease-a-new-theory-suggests-its-an-autoimmune-condition-189047"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally a disorder of the immune system within the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;With lots of research focusing on the brain, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.tyla.com/life/alzheimers-causes-gum-disease-950623-20250221"&gt;scientists have recently questioned whether the mouth has a bigger part to play&lt;/a&gt; in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A study published in 2019 found a connection between a common infection in this area and a decline in brain functions - the ailment being gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Could gum disease be linked to Alzheimer's?

Within days, two of her cats had to be euthanized, and a third was in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of the cats that had eaten raw pet food would later test positive for bird flu. Only a male cat kept apart from the others and fed canned food stayed negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp is an artist in Portland, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oregon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, who breeds and shows Cornish Rex cats. She has fed raw food to all but the male cat for years, and watched recent notices about tainted raw pet food carefully. She believed the food from Wild Coast was being tested for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve since learned, I don’t think there’s really a safe way to trust if someone says they’re testing it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Wild Coast did not respond to the Guardian’s media inquiries about why the company &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;waited a week&lt;/a&gt; to issue a voluntary recall after being notified of possible contamination, and whether it was reaching out to vendors and customers about the recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If Knopp had known, she would have “immediately” switched to canned food – a move she now recommends to all cat owners who were feeding raw food they bought or made on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is not safe,” she said. “Immediately: do not feed raw poultry or raw chicken, raw any table scraps, to cats currently – not even raw eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Raw milk is similarly risky, since milk can contain enormous amounts of virus, and raw beef has also been found to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/usda-dairy-cows-bird-flu-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harbor H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Especially right now, feeding raw food is just all risk,” said Steve Valeika, a small-animal veterinarian with a public health background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;H5N1 joins a host of other pathogens – including salmonella, &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;, campylobacter, listeria and toxoplasmosis – that have been associated with raw pet food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the most unnerving parts for Knopp: her cats never displayed the classic symptoms of respiratory infections, like congestion. Some of the cats had fevers, rapid breathing and eyelid swelling, and one eventually had difficulty walking – a sign of neurological impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But nothing pointed to influenza until X-rays revealed two of the cats with rapid breathing had developed severe pneumonia. That’s when they tested for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Your average person probably wouldn’t take them to the vet with a minor fever that comes and goes,” Knopp said. “Your average person might not notice a sudden increase of breath rate, especially for a cat that’s maybe more reclusive. So I wonder how many cases are also under-reported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp was concerned that she might become infected and spread the virus herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-19" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I don’t want to be known as ‘Bird Flu Mary’,” she said. Her local health department conducted daily symptom check-ins, she started wearing face masks when she went out in public, and she requested a test to see if she had gotten sick. The result was negative for influenza A and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2016, cats in a New York City shelter &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6986351/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;transmitted&lt;/a&gt; H7N2 to at least one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We know that cats can at least transmit another strain of bird flu directly to people,” Valeika said. “I do think these cats potentially present some risk to humans. We don’t have any idea how big that risk is, but it’s definitely one that should be taken seriously until we know better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is not clear how tainted poultry is entering the raw pet food supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All facilities processing meat for humans are inspected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While some meat intended for pets flows through FSIS-inspected facilities, “obviously, a great deal of protein is produced outside of FSIS-inspected facilities and is never intended for human consumption”, said Eric Deeble, deputy under-secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, on 16 January during the last call health officials held with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;US officials were investigating whether any of the H5-positive pet products had gone through such a facility, he said, though no results have been released to the public yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Birds from affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA’s efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all,” Deeble said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Valeika added that he had “no good idea as to why we’re seeing so many sick birds making it into the [pet] food supply – because this must just be the tip of the iceberg”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are other steps pet owners can take to protect animals, and themselves, from bird flu, Valeika said: don’t let cats outside, and don’t let dogs hunt or play with birds, including in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19081209/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ponds and lakes&lt;/a&gt; frequented by migratory birds. Mice and rats, especially near dairy and poultry farms, have also tested positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp has been posting about her experiences and holding “ask me anything” sessions about cats and bird flu on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve channeled a lot of grief into work and into education,” she said. For the two cats who were euthanized, she said, “their death gets to mean something. It can save other animals. It can save some people grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE40MTFSRWJWcWpQOUJqS0l3aWJET05rUElwNDZqWml3cS13VFkxRDZwSjJLX2pDYnNKYkc3ekhRbXdGQTJyclFOSFNTbE9DbWlfc3RsVWZ2VGItbWFvSHBtYzZRUklUbmRCTklKUE5n</guid></item><item><title>Exclusive | CrossFit-loving dad, 42, gets transplant after flu-like symptoms turn out to be end-stage heart failure - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRmR4dGhXRy1tNjVXYUtwMF9uWWNjX2NnTFRkd2E4SnN6MXdSM3JWZXQxQkNqMDU3V2pNX2E5WVF0SEgycGx1N2RLaXI3NXd5Q0FOZjdxWldjcWdOSy1PRXlEMFNQcmE0OUd0RjRmYV9zazZSaGFTNllpSUxkeEJ2TWJzMDFHSC1jaVlWTWhuRGtlRGQtdFdTUE9VWVFGY2xYWDBHUW5ISmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A New York City dad who suffered sudden heart failure and nearly lost his life is sharing his story of survival after a successful heart transplant, encouraging all men to “go to the doctor right away if you feel like something’s off — life is too precious to sit idly by.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nycmuseumgallery.org/1248/news/time-for-a-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt; was a 40-year-old CrossFit-loving fitness buff and school principal enjoying summer vacation when something suddenly went terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The father of two was with his kids in his native Portugal in August 2023 when he experienced alarming flu-like symptoms he had never felt before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just felt very sick — I never coughed as violently — it hurt,” Rodrigues, now 42, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues’ flu-like symptoms turned out to be signs of heart failure. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At five-foot-11 and 175 pounds, Rodrigues should have been the portrait of health in the prime of his life — a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower. But he became a shell of himself as months went by without one good day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was shocking — there was no warning,” he said. “It came on fast and furious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He sought answers from six different doctors “to try to get to the bottom of what was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the array of antibiotics and nasal sprays for a diagnosis of pneumonia and an upper respiratory infection didn’t cut down the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The physical change was dramatic as he hit 190 pounds due to the fluid retention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I noticed was completely abnormal,” said Rodrigues, adding that discovering the appearance of abnormally swollen ankles made him fear it was a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After two months of mysterious symptoms — including constant shortness of breath and exhaustion — Rodriguez darted for the Mount Sinai ER, where he stayed for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of a cold or respiratory virus, he learned that it was severe heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was a a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower when he got sick. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of really scary nights in the hospital,” he said, adding that “not seeing my kids grow up was my worst thought. It’s still my worst thought and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said it was myocarditis, a condition &lt;a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/05/05/yale-study-reveals-insights-post-vaccine-heart-inflammation-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increasingly associated with young males&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00893-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Covid shot&lt;/a&gt;, which led to his heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cause of the myocarditis is unknown,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since he had no family history of it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything],” the doting dad felt grateful that he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIs heart was functioning at 10%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The term they use is end-stage heart failure,” he said, noting that the normal rate is 50% or higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But under the care of Mount Sinai’s Dr. Anuradha Lala, he tried a variety of medications aimed at improving function of the heart and minimizing the rate at which his heart was deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He learned he was in end-stage heart failure, with his heart functioning at just 10%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though genetic testing yielded ”no genetic basis” for his condition, the doctor told The Post. “We don’t know the exact reason that Andre had heart failure. But to me, his journey is about recognizing symptoms, knowing when to ask for help, attuning your mind to your body and coming to terms with being sick.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Building trust and a personal connection is so critical — especially for younger folks, who may just want to run away from the issue,” added Dr. Lala, Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiologist at the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He worked closely with his team, had regular blood work and various tests done under therapeutic care, but there was no improvement. Other organs, including kidney and liver, were affected because they weren’t getting enough healthy oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surviving for his kids was his biggest motivation. “I was motivated to play soccer with them again and run around with them and they kept me really motivated” to get through this ordeal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by the fall of 2024, he needed to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He had no family history it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything].” He was at lead glad he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My heart could not bounce back and I needed to be put on the transplant list” while in Mount Sinai’s ICU and an impella was used to help his left ventricle pump.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Under the care of a team that included cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Anelechi Anyanwu, Rodrigues matched with a viable heart and underwent a successful eight-hour surgery in late October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back at his Museum School in Chelsea, Manhattan, staff and students sent hundreds of emails and letters of support for the fourth-year principal, who forced himself to let go of his fears and put his complete faith in his team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though he doesn’t know much about his donor, he’s grateful for the “gift” that gave him life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early January, Rodrigues was ready to return to his beloved school, where staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a wonderful community where students show so much empathy — towards one another and to me,” he said of the emotional reunion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was ready this January to return to his beloved school, where he is the principal. Staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future remains bright for Rodrigues, who noted life will be different “but also beautiful at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And, yes, that includes CrossFit in his future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The road is still long, but nothing compared to what he was on,” added Dr. Lala, who urged the public not to write off anything that feels worrisome. “The intention isn’t to promote fear, but to instill awareness, around symptoms that should prompt further evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodrigues’ message to others is to seek medical help if something feels off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is your life. This is your life and life is too precious to sit idly and not have a proper diagnosis. And even when the diagnosis is scary, trust the medical professionals and move forward with courage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Have a positive mindset and trust the medical professionals. Keep advocating for yourself and your health.”&lt;/p&gt;

A growing body of research highlights the role &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-mineral-supplement-may-help-prevent-cold-and-flu-symptoms-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals play in preserving cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that magnesium intake could be a key factor in keeping the brain healthy and lowering dementia risk. Researchers are uncovering how this essential mineral might help slow cognitive decline, offering a simple yet powerful strategy for brain preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-023-03123-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database. Researchers focused on magnesium consumption and its potential impact on brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dietary Mg intake trajectories in men and women corresponding to different subgroups of individuals identified by latent class analysis.

To estimate their daily magnesium intake, researchers used a dietary questionnaire administered five times over a 16-month span. This method allowed for a detailed assessment of each participant’s typical &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tfwgXi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking. Individuals consuming more than 550 milligrams of magnesium daily had “brain ages” nearly a year younger by the time they reached 55. In contrast, those consuming the average intake of about 350 milligrams showed more typical patterns of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study lead author Khawlah Alateeq, Ph.D., from the &lt;a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the significance of these results. “Our study shows a 41% increase in magnesium intake could lead to less age-related brain shrinkage, which is associated with better cognitive function and a decreased risk or delayed onset of dementia in later life,” she stated in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alateeq also emphasized magnesium’s potential as an early intervention for brain health. She noted, “This means people of all ages should be paying closer attention to their magnesium intake.” Her statement underscores the importance of dietary choices long before cognitive decline becomes a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also indicated that the brain-protective benefits of increased dietary magnesium were more pronounced in women—especially those post-menopause—than in men. Alateeq theorizes that this might be attributed to magnesium's &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-explore-bioengineering-vegetables-with-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_vital_role_of_magnesium_in_our_diet"&gt;The Vital Role of Magnesium in Our Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is magnesium, and why is it crucial for our brain's health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., a prominent national media spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt;, explains that magnesium, found abundantly in nuts, seeds, dairy, and leafy greens, plays a critical role in maintaining our body tissues. This includes the essential task of nerve signaling in the brain and preserving the blood-brain barrier's integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr Erin I.

As Prest elucidates, low magnesium levels have previously been associated with a heightened risk of brain inflammation and the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Prest sheds light on the intricate relationship between magnesium and menopause, which might explain the gender-based differences observed in the study. “High magnesium intake in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-suggests-that-breastfeeding-may-help-prevent-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-menopausal women&lt;/a&gt; correlates with reduced inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, indicating reduced inflammation,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="optimizing_daily_magnesium_intake"&gt;Optimizing Daily Magnesium Intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults' magnesium needs can fluctuate based on factors such as age and biological sex, typically ranging from 310 to 420 mg/day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Bar graph of the associations (beta values) between dietary magnesium (Mg) trajectories and a the brain volumes including gray matter, white matter, left hippocampus, right hippocampus, and white matter lesions; and b blood pressure (BP) including mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) stratified by sex.

Before starting any supplement, consulting with a healthcare professional is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_bigger_picture_on_brain_health"&gt;The Bigger Picture on Brain Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the potential of magnesium in brain health is promising, it's essential to understand the broader picture. As Melissa Prest asserts, a balanced diet rich in magnesium-laden foods such as &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-incredible-benefits-of-fiber-to-human-health-and-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole grains and leafy vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can enhance brain function by combating inflammation and supplying the necessary nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr. Amit Sachdev, Director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at Michigan State University.

Hence, while these findings are compelling, they should be taken with a degree of caution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the pursuit of knowledge around &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/doing-this-one-activity-is-critical-to-healthy-ageing-and-avoiding-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; continues, this study underscores the potential of magnesium as a nutritional ally in our fight against cognitive decline. Balancing our diet and incorporating magnesium-rich foods might just be the key to a sharper, healthier brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxONDRQeEVpMnVwdGV5UlgzeVdIZ3FpNGxOdFJMV3QxUXdTeUlLSkNjNE1ONmRUX1A0NTVkLWY5eUJ1dkhFa1VNRjIxZjVBeVdlZGNDWENKWDBlMU1waWpXMHNaZW5hTlpkWXpramRqTWkzcmpkVVhQdm5QQUtYbXhRRDBCejRVUDVDQ3F5VnpaR2Q1eTEySUNJVGozakNtQkRTb2N2MGRzbkFJeGZiaE0tandQOA</guid></item><item><title>Another mystery disease outbreak in DR Congo: What we know - DW (English)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNVE94dHlUM293N3dwZm56VGtWTlpKRElrRmJjUm1McVdoWWw2WG04X2l4S1ZwVmhZMXk5ZkhJQjZuMUVmUEppY285VF9yV1FxQVhiZ2VhV0R3eUhHTGNPWUFGUXMtVVJidmU5d2djU2Y5QkVTREQ3SmdVc1RyajFYQUlRNTJRTG1jOHlfTW1ZY3o0NzhX0gGUAUFVX3lxTFBWVmtGVWFDREY2cWhDSU5tM1VnQ3FXNEl1ZnVxWl9xR25zOGNTRzloUzdHZmVlcWhac2xFeFlHa1ZOcy1kRXd3cEZ0dk9INy0waVRuYlpmT3BoQUcxWUhjbjNzTXBvUmZyUVdxMnlqR2NXYU1ScTJqTWpvOUJJY21VN1VVRHU0d3NYTng1NHo3Qm9CY0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cc0m0op s1ebneao rich-text t1it8i9i r1wgtjne wgx1hx2 b1ho1h07"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another mystery disease outbreak in the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/democratic-republic-of-congo-drc/t-38232616"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo &lt;/a&gt; has emerged in recent weeks, resulting in at least 60 deaths, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/what-we-known-about-congo-mystery-illness/a-71005734"&gt;similar event in September 2024&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as "Disease X" before the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/world-health-organization-who/t-38396203"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; identified it as a cocktail of several known acute respiratory illnesses complicated by malaria and malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new outbreaks could have similar origins, but it will likely take time to determine exactly what the cause is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the current situation in the DR Congo?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 cases have been reported across the DR Congo's Equateur province and 141 cases of a &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Basankusu's health zone. A separate outbreak in early February consisted of 158 cases and 58 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, Bolamba village reported 12 cases and eight deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What have initial tests shown?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health authorities in the DR Congo and WHO experts are carrying out investigations to determine the cause of the illness and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early lab tests ruled out &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/ebola-symptoms-treatment-vaccines-sudan-virus/a-71524627"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/marburg-outbreaks-one-of-the-worlds-deadliest-viruses/a-64724490"&gt;Marburg disease&lt;/a&gt;. Half of those tested have tested positive for &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/malaria/t-67585233"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further testing will be undertaken for meningitis and potential toxic contamination. Influenza and typhoid have also been suggested as possible causes of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some diseases have been ruled out, the WHO has sent epidemiologists to the region to conduct further sampling and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're not really satisfied with the sampling, so we've sent two WHO epidemiologists up there," Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, told DW News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They're up there now and they're overseeing the sampling and getting them back to the laboratories in [DR Congo's capital] Kinshasa."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do officials know the potential cause?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of the disease — and whether the illnesses in different regions are connected — remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early reports suggested the first cases were among a group of children who may have eaten a bat, though this incident is not yet confirmed as the cause of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bats are &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/how-identifying-hotspots-of-zoonotic-disease-could-prevent-another-pandemic/a-58167867"&gt;known reservoirs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/top-10-most-dangerous-viruses-in-the-world/a-17846283"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and other disease-causing pathogens. Global health advice recommends people steer clear of exposure to dead animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the main outbreak villages of Basankusu and Bolomba are 116 miles (186 kilometers) apart, it's unclear if the disease outbreaks share the same cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of the mystery disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO's latest memo says symptoms are broad, and include fever, headaches, chills, sweating, stiffness in the neck, muscular aches, joint and body pain, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broadness of these symptoms and their potential to apply to many diseases makes it impossible to pinpoint the cause without analysis of biological samples from patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health experts say the mystery disease is likely caused by several known pathogens acting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That malaria has been found in one in two cases already is important information for health authorities, but the addition of further sampling and analysis by WHO officials in conjunction with local teams will help narrow the search for a cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tests are never 100% accurate, and it is likely that with increased testing, we will have a confirmed pathogen in some of those samples," said Michael Head, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — WHO endorses new malaria vaccine for Africa rollout" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;WHO endorses new malaria vaccine for Africa rollout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-67096544" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67096544" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/61551953_605.webp" data-duration="02:36"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20231013_QMALARIAAFR_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20231013_QMALARIAAFR_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Could the disease spread further?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health infrastructure in this region of the DR Congo is limited, and there are concerns that the disease could spread. As with the malaria-respiratory infections that caused the 2024 outbreak, malnutrition and other underlying conditions can increase the chances of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local health authorities have been addressing Mpox and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/who-probes-new-ebola-case-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/a-59456143"&gt;Ebola outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, so Head suggests the challenges of limited infrastructure to manage new diseases can be offset by their "experience at addressing infectious disease epidemics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should a previously unknown pathogen be identified as the cause, health authorities will need to increase measures to contain the spread of the disease and identify the method of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the &lt;a href="/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season"&gt;recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025-2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends that &lt;strong&gt;trivalent &lt;/strong&gt;vaccines for use in the 2025-2026 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egg-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell culture-, recombinant protein- or nucleic acid-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for the B/Yamagata lineage component of quadrivalent influenza vaccines remains unchanged from previous recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As an outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;continues to spread&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas and New Mexico, many people are wondering, how bad could it get?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing to know is that measles is one of the most contagious diseases on Earth — more than Ebola, smallpox or just about any other infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 children used to die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the vaccine's power to beat back measles outbreaks starts to crumble when vaccination rates drop low enough. We asked scientists to help us decipher how lower vaccination rates can affect spread and what that means for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The math of measles spread&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand just how easily measles spreads, it helps to know a scientific concept known as the basic reproduction number, or R naught. That's the number of people, on average, that a single infected person can transmit a disease to.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The R naught for measles ranges from 12 to 18. In other words, if one person is infected, they will infect as many as 18 others on average. That's much higher than with other infectious diseases, such as Ebola with an R naught of 2.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, R naught is a theoretical number. "It's not some magical constant," says &lt;a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/justin-lessler-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Lessler&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It assumes that &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/#:~:text=The%20effective%20reproduction%20number%2C%20Re%2C%20sometimes%20also%20called%20R,and%20also%20as%20people%20die." target="_blank"&gt;no one has immunity to a given disease&lt;/a&gt;. That's what the "naught" refers to, as in zero immunity. It's useful for comparing the infectious potential of different diseases. But in the real world, a lot of different factors can alter how easily measles transmits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This brings us to a concept known as the&lt;em&gt; effective&lt;/em&gt; reproduction number. That's the number of people that a sick person can infect in a given population at any specific time. It changes as more people become immune through infection or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also changes depending on how people behave. Do infected people isolate? Are vulnerable, unvaccinated people clustered together, socializing with each other? That kind of situation "gives an opportunity for the virus to exist in a place," Lessler says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, the most effective firewall against transmission is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how much a lower vaccination rate can affect measles' spread in a theoretical group of kindergartners who cluster together every weekday in a classroom.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If a disease has a reproduction number under 1, infections will spread slowly and an outbreak will eventually die out, because each infected person spreads it to fewer than one other person on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, here's where exponential case growth can happen. Let's say a measles outbreak has an effective reproduction number of 3, like in the graphic above. That might not sound so bad, until you consider that those three people can go on to infect three others, and so on and so on. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the original strain of the virus that causes COVID had a reproduction number of around 3, and we all saw how that went, says &lt;a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/matthew-ferrari" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not unreasonable to think that measles could spread as fast as [pre-vaccine] SARS-CoV-2 in populations, particularly in school settings, where kids are vaccinated at 80-85%," Ferrari says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vulnerable Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%. That's well below the 95% vaccination rate threshold needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been falling for years and are currently at 92.7%. In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower, creating pockets of opportunity for measles to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About half of the counties in Texas have a kindergarten vaccination rate below that 95% threshold. In Foard County, Texas, the rate stands at just under 67%. In a classroom with that vaccination rate, one infected child would infect five other unvaccinated classmates with measles on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You can find even lower vaccination rates if you drill down to the school level. One private school in Fort Worth, Texas, reported a kindergarten vaccination rate of just over 14%. That's not to say the outbreak will reach places like this, but if it did, they'd be very vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says many factors will determine how far this outbreak spreads and how big it gets. That includes how many people get vaccinated in response to the outbreak, whether suspected cases are quarantined, and how well contact tracing works so exposed people don't infect others.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And that's critical, because a person infected with measles can be contagious from four days before the telltale measles rash appears, until four days after, says &lt;a href="https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/carla-garcia-carreno" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you can be spreading it without knowing you have the measles," Carreno says. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left the room. "That's what makes it also difficult to control."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says in conditions where under-vaccinated people are grouped together — such as the close-knit rural community &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/first-measles-death-reported-in-west-texas-outbreak-thats-infected-more-than-120-people" target="_blank"&gt;where the current outbreak is largely spreading&lt;/a&gt; — measles has the potential to cause reasonably sized outbreaks. But he thinks the firewall provided by higher vaccination and immunity levels in the broader population will eventually tamp down the  outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Are we at risk of getting, like in the old days, thousands or tens of thousands of cases from this outbreak? That's probably pretty unlikely," Lessler says. "The [vaccination] firewall is still pretty strong at that sort of broad level."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if measles vaccination rates continue their downward trend amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;rising anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt;, he says the days when measles outbreaks involve thousands of cases could return within the next five to 10 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Gynaecology&lt;/a&gt;, then discovered the teen had no vaginal opening, a rare defect that only affects between 4,000 to 10,000 newborn girls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, this should have made it impossible for the teen to get pregnant without technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition, called vaginal atresia, also made it impossible for her to give birth through her vagina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant doctors had to perform a C-section to deliver the baby, which turned out to be a healthy 6.2lb boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, which dates back to 1988, has recently resurfaced, following a &lt;a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/health/14160094/found-out-pregnant-going-into-labour-mum-minutes-later/" rel=""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of a Scottish woman who thought she had a burst appendix, only to discover she was pregnant - and gave birth 40 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, medics treating the girl in Lesotho were puzzled as to &lt;span&gt;how the teen had become pregnant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl claimed that in the months leading up to the birth, she noticed her body changing shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because she did not have a vaginal opening and had not engaged in penetrative vaginal sex, she “did not believe she was pregnant".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors learned that nine months before she had attended hospital for a stab wound to her stomach region shortly after giving oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6346858965112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="lYPa0anAF" data-video-id-pending="6346858965112" data-brightcove-id="video_6346858965112_5067014667001-193433" id="video_6346858965112_5067014667001-193433" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;Dr Philippa Kaye answers the web’s most EMBARRASSING women’s sex questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, she confided in a nurse that her ex-boyfriend had violently attacked her in was described as a "mini war" when he caught her giving oral sex to a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts decided the sperm she swallowed somehow made its way to her reproductive organs through her stab wounds, leading to the unexpected pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that the son resembled the father excluded it as an even more miraculous conception," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this pregnancy even more surprising is that stomach acid is usually strong enough to kill sperm quickly, making it unable to fertilise an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team’s most "plausible" explanation is that the sperm survived because the girl had no food in her stomach at the time of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe this lowered the acidity in her stomach, allowing the sperm to travel through her stab wounds and reach her uterus, where it fertilised the egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;Other bizarre medical case reports&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The US Sun</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 11:08:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQcVNaUzhQczlsUW5sYWZLZDRhZFdVVFY4S2tEazBqVHpHYkswbUhnYlJCV3BXVC1MTG5rQnRaYmtuYnhMbmpFVHRZQnhyTElNcHgxTnduVU10MXVJY1RZTENLS3pWMDJlM2ZTZlg5QTlLZW1Sc2lkX3dnenlYbVdZVlMtZk9OSXhiM2JB</guid></item><item><title>Woman's Mysterious Burning Feet Traced to Worms in Her Brain - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQelllSTlQYlI2N1hwSWgtRi1uR2hRaGZaTktTcC11ZmFCbGdaZTdLM01Pam1Jdm5WT1BHT3cwVHJtUjNkc3RaRUlmUU9DNXNoWktqZ1hQOUVwOVJyUmRCZXFDMVRBVFhZTHg0dkxDc1c3UDRnMWg3SFpXQWR3ZHUzWlp0aEZQNTNmdk1aUThSb2NVdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A 30-year-old woman in the United States was told by doctors she had parasites in her brain after presenting to the hospital with a burning sensation in her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worms seem to have been unlucky souvenirs the &lt;span&gt;woman &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;unknowingly  picked up while traveling in Thailand, Japan, and Hawaii. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded in her central nervous system, the quiet invaders didn't 'make a peep' until 12 days after the woman had returned home. Only then did their presence cause an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4312175/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;intense immune response&lt;/a&gt; that took a further week to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over several days, hot pain in the woman's feet crawled up her legs, trunk, and arms, before erupting in a splitting headache that even frequent doses of pain relief medication couldn't alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ul1QjBYxQU?start=122&amp;amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial visit to the emergency department turned up only a mild increase in disease-fighting white blood cells. But after days of unrelenting discomfort and a mild  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="153305" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, the woman returned to a different hospital looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following treatment with intravenous anti-inflammatories and an anti-anxiety medication called lorazepam, her headache finally abated and she was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once again, the symptoms persisted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, when the woman woke, she began to pack for a vacation that she had not planned. Her roommate noticed her strange behavior and encouraged her to lie back down in bed. Hours later, when the woman was still showing signs of confusion, her partner took her to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The development of confusion in this patient with sensory symptoms, headache, and possible intermittent fever suggests the possibility of encephalitis and further increases concern about a central nervous system infection," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514?logout=true"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; infectious disease specialist Joseph Zunt from the University of Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing her blood, her doctors found no sign of parasites, and a CT scan of her head showed no red flags beneath her skull. Yet when medical staff performed a lumbar puncture, they found the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain and spinal cord, contained markers of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meningitis/eosinophilic-meningitis"&gt;eosinophilic meningitis&lt;/a&gt; – a rare form of brain infection that can be caused by parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the patient's recent travel and her symptoms, her doctors agreed she met the criteria for a presumptive diagnosis of angiostrongyliasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insidious disease is also known as &lt;a href="https://www.biisc.org/pest/rlw/"&gt;rat lungworm &lt;/a&gt;because it is caused by the parasite &lt;i&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&lt;/i&gt;, which starts its life cycle in the lungs of a rodent before spreading to slugs and snails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-australian-man-died-eight-years-after-eating-a-garden-slug-in-a-dare-gone-wrong"&gt;eating uncooked slugs or snails&lt;/a&gt;, but if we bite into a &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/rat-lung-worm.aspx"&gt;fresh, leafy vegetable&lt;/a&gt; that one of these creatures has slimed, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7887556/"&gt;parasite's larvae&lt;/a&gt; can end up in our bodies without us knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's one of the reasons why washing green produce is so important when staying in parts of the world &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/rat-lung-worm.aspx"&gt;where rat lungworm spreads&lt;/a&gt;, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Australia. Undercooked crab or prawns can also be a vector, as these animals eat slugs and snails, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153319" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153319" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-642x845.jpg" alt="Rat Lungworm Cycle" class="size-medium wp-image-153319" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-642x845.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-315x415.jpg 315w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-768x1011.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-1167x1536.jpg 1167w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-1556x2048.jpg 1556w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-600x790.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153319" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life cycle of &lt;em&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; and symptoms of infection.

&lt;p&gt;Only occasionally are the larvae able to be seen in the brain for a definitive diagnosis. Usually, brain scans &lt;a href="https://www.ajnr.org/content/21/6/1090"&gt;only hint&lt;/a&gt; at damage from these parasites. The image below, for instance, shows clear signals of lesions in parts of a 32-year-old's brain that are indicative of angiostrongyliasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153338" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-642x209.jpg" alt="Parasite Brain Markers " class="size-medium wp-image-153338" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-642x209.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-1024x333.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-768x250.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-600x195.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153338" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A 32-year-old man with areas of fuzzy hyperintense signal in parts of his brain due to angiostrongyliasis.

The patient was also given a high dose of a steroid called prednisone to help alleviate inflammation in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms abated with the combination treatment, and on her sixth day in hospital, she was able to go home &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;this time without hidden passengers in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514?logout=true"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At her home, in Maplewood, N.J., the bathroom scale had documented the same 25-pound weight loss she and her internist now saw. It happened suddenly, over the past few months. Initially she blamed a bout of Covid-19 that she picked up during a trip with friends to Morocco three months earlier. But that seemed unlikely: The illness felt like no more than a bad cold and lasted only one week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It wasn’t as if she were wasting away, and she rather liked the way she looked at this new weight. Still, she hadn’t been dieting, so it worried her. Just a few weeks earlier, a friend lost weight unintentionally like this and was diagnosed with metastatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By the time she got to this appointment with her primary-care doctor, the woman, an emergency-room physician, had already done some investigating. She saw her ob-gyn, who gave her the all-clear. A recent colonoscopy and mammogram were normal. Still, she wanted to hear what her internist, Dr. James Rommer, would make of her unintended weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Rommer had known the woman for many years. He saw her before her left-knee replacement surgery the previous year; not long afterward, she called to tell him that her blood pressure was high. He started her on a blood-pressure medication and had increased it at each of her follow-up visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She didn’t feel sick, the patient told Rommer. She had no nausea, no stomach pain. Her appetite was good. Maybe she was a little more tired than usual, but that could be left over from the holidays, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Her blood pressure was elevated but otherwise her exam was normal. Rommer agreed the weight loss was concerning; patients don’t usually lose weight by accident. He outlined his plan: For the weight loss, he would order some basic lab tests — blood count, chemistries, liver and thyroid studies.

State officials told TPR they have not confirmed a case of either type of illness at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy Traditional School - Cibolo said in a statement provided to TPR around 6:30 Thursday evening that the school was "taking all necessary precautions following the confirmation of a measles case in a first-grade classroom." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement was provided by the charter school's management company, Vertex Education. However, a letter that appears to have been sent to parents used the terms measles and rubella interchangeably. Rubella is sometimes called German measles, but it is not the same illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPR contacted Sean Amir with the charter management company seeking clarification, and Amir told TPR the case was actually rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubella doesn't typically make kids as sick as measles can, but it poses a threat to women in the first trimester of pregnancy. It can cause miscarriage or stillbirth. Children are typically vaccinated against rubella, measles, and mumps at the same time when they get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“School officials are working closely with state and local public health authorities to monitor the situation and ensure the well-being of the school community. School will remain open on Friday, Feb. 28, and as an added precaution, a thorough sanitization of the campus will take place after school hours,” school officials said in the original statement provided to TPR. “Families who have been directly notified should continue to follow the guidance provided. We appreciate our community's patience, trust, and cooperation as we navigate this situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and local health officials have not confirmed the illness reported by the school. A spokesperson for the state health department &lt;a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/02/28/state-health-officials-say-no-measles-case-at-cibolo-charter-school/" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;told KSAT News&lt;/a&gt; Thursday no measles case had been confirmed in the area. Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Chris Van Deusen provided the same statement to TPR.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no confirmed cases in that area. Just because someone is being tested for measles doesn’t mean they have measles," Van Deusen said in an email. "There are a lot of different illness that cause a rash, and we want people to be thinking about measles, and we want doctors who see a patient with a rash that could be measles to have them tested. But at this point, no confirmed cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Deusen later told TPR his department has not confirmed a case of either measles or rubella in the San Antonio area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials will update the statewide count of confirmed measles cases Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials notified the public of a &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-02-23/breaking-news-possible-measles-exposures-in-san-antonio" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;potential measles exposure in the San Antonio area on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, but it is unclear if that exposure is connected to the possible measles case at Legacy Traditional School – Cibolo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination status of the person the school said has rubella is also unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the risk of spreading measles, community vaccination rates need to be at 95% or higher. Dozens of San Antonio-area schools &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/education/2025-02-25/dozens-of-san-antonio-schools-have-low-measles-vaccination-rates" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;are below that threshold&lt;/a&gt;, including Legacy Traditional Schools. 94.5% of Kindergartners at Legacy had received the MMR vaccine last year, placing it just under the level required for herd immunity. Other San Antonio schools have much lower vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;According to medical experts&lt;/a&gt;, the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is 97% effective against measles once a person has received two doses. Texas requires school-aged children to be vaccinated against measles, but families are able to request exemptions for both medical and conscientious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday&lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/bioscience-medicine/2025-02-25/state-reports-west-texas-measles-outbreak-cases-now-at-124" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;, 124 cases of measles had been confirmed in Texas&lt;/a&gt; by state medical experts, primarily in West Texas in and around Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, state and local officials reported that &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/2025-02-26/a-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;a school-age child had died&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly infectious among the unvaccinated, and causes fever, rash, and respiratory symptoms. It can also lead to more serious complications like pneumonia and swelling of the brain, which can sometimes be fatal. Young children and people who are immunocompromised are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person can become sick up to 21 days after exposure, and the virus at first appears much like another respiratory illness. Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth after two or three days, followed by a rash on the face, head, and body that lasts for five to six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An infected person is contagious up to four days before the rash appears and four days after the rash appears, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bonnie Petrie contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But they couldn't find anything amiss so I was sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was December 2016, and over the next few weeks, my condition deteriorated fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I lost 15 pounds of muscle mass and ended up confined to a wheelchair because I was too weak to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain fog, intense burning sensations and debilitating pain made it impossible to work - ironically as a doctor, having started my job as an internal medicine physician at a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/las-vegas/index.html" id="mol-ecd725d0-e4d3-11ef-832e-4599869fb06c"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; hospital just three months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By January, things had become so dire I wrote my will, unsure if I would survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;How could this be happening? I was a fit and healthy 32-year-old doctor who follows a good diet and exercises regularly - and suddenly I was living a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili pictured above (left) as a doctor and while healing from his injuries (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After researching my symptoms, I realized they had been caused by a common antibiotic Ciprofloxacin - known as Cipro - that I had prescribed to patients myself countless times for urinary tract infections, persistent coughs, and skin infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'd taken the drug to help treat a stomach infection and hadn't thought anything of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after just three doses taken twice a day, my body betrayed me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was aware the drug could cause side effects, but my medical training had led me to believe they would be minor and subside in a few days. This couldn't be further from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ciprofloxacin is part of a common class of medications called fluoroquinolone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than five million Americans are prescribed this class of antibiotic every year - yet most are completely unaware of the serious, and sometimes life-altering, complications they can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs are subject to three black box warnings from the FDA - the most severe warning the drug agency can place on a medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016 - shortly before I took Cipro - the FDA recommended that fluoroquinolone drugs should only be used as a 'last resort.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a notice, the agency said the antibiotic should only be used for patients with sinusitis, bronchitis or UTIs when there were 'no other treatment options' available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was because the 'risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits in these patients'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite the FDA recording more than 60,000 injuries linked to fluoroquinolones from the 1990s to the end of 2015, countless cases go unrecognized or misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili is pictured above with HHS secretary nominee Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I desperately sought answers for myself, I found an online community of thousands of people suffering the same debilitating side effects. Their stories became my lifeline, confirming I was not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the worst side effects I experienced was the impact on my brain receptors, which plunged my body in a relentless state of fight-or-flight - that felt like a psychological nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients who experience severe reactions to these medications call it being 'floxed'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms can be immediate, as in my case, or emerge weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most antibiotics work by targeting structures in the bacteria, such as its cell wall, to weaken and kill the pathogen in order to eradicate the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown fluoroquinolones, however, attack bacterial DNA and damage human mitochondrial DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since mitochondria are the energy producers of our cells, the damage may cause them to produce less energy, which disrupts many of the normal functions of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To recover, I realized I needed to repair my mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To do this, I replenished magnesium in my body, taking more than 2,000 milligrams (mg) per day in the beginning to help restore my tendons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also took supplements to reduce my body's oxidative stress. This is when there are too many free radicals - highly reactive unstable molecules - in the body that are damaging cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili is pictured above using his wheelchair, which he was forced into after Cipro left him unable to use his legs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili is pictured above receiving experimental stem cell therapy that he says healed him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to heal, I also explored regenerative therapies and the turning point came in February 2017 when I received a groundbreaking stem cell treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My doctor, the late Dr Mark Berman, who pioneered stem cell surgery in America, extracted tissue from my abdomen, isolated stem cells, and re-injected them into my abdomen in an attempt to revive my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was completely awake throughout the procedure, with the stem cells injected just below the skin. It wasn't painful but the treatment did take several hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stem cells have the unique ability to self-renew and develop into many different types of cells so can regenerate damaged tissues. They can also contain undamaged mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amazingly, it worked. And with the help of supplements, I began to regain my strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within weeks, I was standing and walking again. And against all odds, I made what I believe to be a near-total recovery from Ciprofloxacin toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, I am healthier than ever and completely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But my horrendous experience transformed my perspective on medicine.  I no longer work in a hospital and now focus on helping patients through regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili has now set up a clinic that aims to help others who say they were injured by ciprofloxacin (two patients pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I would never prescribe Ciprofloxacin again because of the harm it could do to patients'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to help make a difference, I founded &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://regenerativemedicinela.com/"&gt;Regenerative Medicine LA&lt;/a&gt;, a clinic dedicated to treating individuals injured by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, as well as those suffering from autoimmune diseases, vaccine injuries, neuropathy, dementia, Parkinson’s, MS, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also launched &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://regenlabs.com/"&gt;Regen Labs&lt;/a&gt;, a biohacking supplement line offering natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowing what I know now, I would never prescribe Ciprofloxacin again because of the harm it could do to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through my clinic, I am committed to helping others heal and ensuring no one else endures what I went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medical community must do more to recognize the dangers of fluoroquinolones and exercise extreme caution before prescribing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I survived, I recovered, and now, I fight for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;As told to Luke Andrews, health reporter at DailyMail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 07:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNY2ZEODduRnpjWkl2SjBSMXkxRV9sR2pKemg3c0VmU2VESzhjMGlhVXFiZzFHTndya3hXYU9yWXJyZTZ0eGpzZHpQR3pHcEdLQkx0Q2RjVWx6blRLbzJQVGpDMllhd3JzaHI5aWlrUEtjNERlemtjUXA1UzlIVzYtMUVZOU9SWU9BRGZkVWN0cXhacmFRQzlF</guid></item><item><title>HPV vaccine that RFK once called "dangerous" credited for precancerous lesions rate plunge -

&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from about 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can happen even in healthy people, but those at highest risk include: infants and children under 5 years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems from medications or underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in one of these high-risk groups and were exposed to measles at one of these locations, be sure to contact your health care provider to discuss any steps you need to take to protect yourself or loved ones against complications from measles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable with the safe and highly effective measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and that protection is long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
