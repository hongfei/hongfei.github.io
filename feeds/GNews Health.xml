Currently, he's working on eating an earlier dinner to extend his &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/intermittent-fasting-benefits-and-risks-for-longevity-weight-loss-cancer-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to tests that measure biomarkers such as inflammation, blood pressure, and cholesterol, while his chronological age is 68, Verdin's biological age is between 48 and 53. There is no consensus on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;definition of biological age&lt;/a&gt; or how to measure it, so it differs according to the tests he refers to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, Verdin believes lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, sleep, stress management, and social connections, play a larger role in determining &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;how long we will live in good health&lt;/a&gt; than genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin shared the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-diet-food-list-cheap-easy-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt; diet he swears by for longevity&lt;/a&gt;, and the three foods he limits as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="df33d72a-30d2-43d9-aa42-469f511db45c" data-toc-id="df33d72a-30d2-43d9-aa42-469f511db45c"&gt;Swears by: eating a Mediterranean-style diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin said that there's strong evidence to suggest eating a good balance of complex carbohydrates — such as sweet potatoes — fats, and proteins is essential for health.&lt;/p&gt;

They tend to be highly marketed, low in fiber, and contain large amounts of fat, sugar, and salt: a combination which makes them "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-research-explains-why-cant-stop-eating-chips-ice-cream-2023-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;hyper-palatable&lt;/a&gt;," which studies suggest leads to overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand how they affect our health, but eating a diet high in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-processed-foods-health-problems-study-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;UPFs was linked to 32 health &lt;/a&gt;problems, including obesity, cancer, and depression in a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;

So you can drink several pieces of fruit in seconds, which you wouldn't be able to do if you ate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consume sugary foods or beverages, our blood sugar spikes and the pancreas needs to release more insulin to balance it. With repeated spikes, after a period of time the pancreas may not be able to keep up with production needed, which can lead to insulin resistance, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber, which is great for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, also delays the absorption of the sugar therefore &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-carbs-without-blood-sugar-spikes-2024-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;preventing blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat an orange, the sugar comes in at a much slower rate. So your body is actually able to cope with it," Verdin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a6d835a4-6e3c-4e9f-80fa-7239d650259a" data-toc-id="a6d835a4-6e3c-4e9f-80fa-7239d650259a"&gt;Avoids: alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin used to have a glass of wine with his wife most evenings, but after trying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dry-january-tips-first-timers-2022-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Dry January &lt;/a&gt;during the COVID pandemic, he realized that he had more energy and slept better without it.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, has become quite common lately, claiming lots of lives in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The effects of the disease have been such that even many young people have been forced to drop out of school because they lost their bread winners through hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But a bigger question is, what is hypertension, and what exactly causes it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This article provides some insights on hypertension, its causes, and the dangers it poses.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Overview&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension has become rampant among young people in the country, many of whom are unaware of their status. This has become a major health concern due to the alarming rate at which this group is developing hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is hypertension&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is consistently too high. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is expressed as two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blood pressure ranges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Normal blood pressure: Less than 120/80mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Elevated blood pressure: 120-129/80mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stage 1 hypertension: 130-139/80-89mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stage 2 hypertension: 140 or higher/90 or higher mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Causes of hypertension and risk factors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Family history: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Age: The risk of developing hypertension increases with age.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Obesity: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lifestyle: Lack of physical exercise, smoking, and consuming a diet high in salt, sugar, and saturated fats contribute to hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stress: Chronic stress can raise blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kidney diseases: Certain kidney diseases can cause hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Symptoms&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension often has no particular symptoms, but some people may experience:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Headaches&lt;br&gt;
Dizziness&lt;br&gt;
Nosebleeds&lt;br&gt;
Shortness of breath&lt;br&gt;
Chest pain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Complications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Untreated hypertension can lead to serious health complications, which include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Heart attack&lt;br&gt;
Stroke&lt;br&gt;
Vision loss&lt;br&gt;
Kidney disease&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension is diagnosed using a sphygmomanometer, which measures the pressure in the arteries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Treatment of hypertension usually involves a combination of medication and lifestyle changes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What can be done?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Education and awareness: Raising awareness about hypertension and the dangers it poses can help to regulate it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular checkup: Having checked regularly can help to reduce the dangers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Medication and positive lifestyle: Always take your medication, which helps to remove excess fluid from the body.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lifestyle Changes: Engage in moderate-intensity physical activity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Eat a balanced diet focused on whole unprocessed foods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stay hydrated by drinking lots of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Reduce salt intake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Manage stress by engaging in stress-reducing activities like yoga.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular blood pressure checks and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help identify and manage hypertension regardless of age.&lt;br&gt;

They went to college together, studied the same major, met their husbands on the same day and got married two months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You just have this bond unlike any other," Mariela Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something they didn't share — a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having her go through something that I couldn't go through, and I couldn't experience was just so hard," Mariela Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brinlee Luster and her twin sister, Mariela Luster. (Photo: Brinlee Luster)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, at age 21, Brinlee Luster started experiencing puzzling symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was having severe abdominal cramping," she said. "I remember going on a hike and I was just out of breath. I was so fatigued, so tired."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors initially attributed her symptoms to irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety or her birth control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just thought, you know, I'm stressed, I'm planning my wedding, I'm about to graduate college, there's a lot of changes," Brinlee Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when her symptoms worsened, she went in for a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her results turned her life upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think anything can prepare you for that moment when you're told you have cancer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinlee Luster was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer and underwent 30 rounds of chemotherapy and several surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a young adult, like right at the brink of where my life was accelerating, I had to slow down and watch everyone else go forward, and that was really hard," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brinlee Luster receives treatment for her cancer. (Photo: Brinlee Luster)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, since 2020, there has been a 9% increase in colon cancer diagnoses in people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There really is unfortunately no such thing as too young for colon cancer. About 1 in 7 of the patients in my practice with colon cancer are under the age of 45," said Dr. Mark Lewis, a cancer survivor and director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis said this could be due to lifestyle factors, genetics or certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antibiotics in childhood and in adulthood can affect the bacteria that line the colon," he said. "We're being very, very careful about prescribing antibiotics to young people because we do know there is at least a slight increased risk for colon cancer decades later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of colorectal cancer include abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, changes in bowel movements like diarrhea, or blood in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it may be uncomfortable, Lewis said bringing up concerns to a provider can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are willing to talk to your doctor about your gut health, I promise you we are going to be better at finding colon cancer sooner," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brinlee Luster is accompanied in the hospital by her sister Mariela Luster. (Photo: Brinlee Luster)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinlee Luster finished her last round of chemo in December and is in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariela Luster has since had a colonoscopy, where they removed polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like to think that she really did save my life in a way because I was headed down that route," Mariela Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twins created "&lt;a href="https://theportstudio.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;The Port Studio&lt;/a&gt;," a line of comfortable sweatshirts with IV access for people going through chemo. They also started a podcast called "&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/hu/podcast/live-today/id1757263555" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Live Today&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been so healing for us to work on together," Mariela Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to hide that I had cancer," Brinlee Luster said. "Sharing your story is uncomfortable, but I want to be able to share it so that people can be inspired. There's always room for hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National guidelines recommend people begin colorectal screening at age 45. If you are younger than 45 and are experiencing any abnormal symptoms, talk to your doctor. Intermountain Health also offers &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/virtual-care/fit-test" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;home-based tests for colon cancer screening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 01:41:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPZHB6UlJQLXZwS1hNb0l3V1NTWVNFZXNlaTJ2dW8yTDBBWmQwMHp5OE5VVWNaYTN5c2hiUzMxNS1uOVdESm9qQjc4aXVzTzJTcWpNaDNLaEZyUTZoZzRyZ0ZiYk9raDVEeDlIakJtaE80WXdBdG56aGZsbUlGbldPVmdINThCbl9lekt4WVI2SmdWRlIxRmNJTnZqd3dJTE0wM0xOTXZQWHhlQ1QwVFFOOA</guid></item><item><title>Expert Reveals 8 'Essential' Ways to Reduce Your Risk of Stroke - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPNnRibTZBbWxsV0VUTFY5MmNoanNYM0RzMjJ6ZHItZUVGYXRsV3hXQno3Tm9PSnU2d2hYMUNDTU1mZ0VDMllEbGlTSGdDVEtDdUQweTdTQ2VoVV9sREdYaUhwajgxMXNPV3EyTFRNd2YtamE2Y05GZnktN3AyRHdsRzJvbV9ZSjEtTktmWTc5WTluWjlH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;As a nurse working in a neurocritical care, I witnessed the sudden and devastating effects of stroke on &lt;a href="https://researchportal.lsbu.ac.uk/en/publications/an-overview-of-traumatic-brain-injury-in-adults-3"&gt;survivors and their carers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following my nursing career, I became a researcher specializing in stroke. Knowledge of &lt;a href="https://groups.stroke.org.uk/what-is-stroke/what-can-i-do-to-reduce-my-risk"&gt;stroke risk factors&lt;/a&gt; in the general public is poor, so stroke prevention is a priority for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke is &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/stroke-tia/background-information/prevalence/"&gt;a leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death and disability in England – yet it is &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616306791"&gt;largely preventable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often considered an older person's illness but, although stroke risk does increase with age, it can happen at any time of life. In fact, stroke incidence is &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stroke-in-young-adults-causes"&gt;increasing among adults&lt;/a&gt; below the age of 55 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk factors that tend to be more common among older people – such as high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, obesity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155781" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, physical inactivity and poor diet – are increasingly found in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lifestyle risks include heavy alcohol consumption or binge drinking and recreational drugs such as amphetamines, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cocaine-and-alcohol-heres-why-theyre-such-a-deadly-combination-125278"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; and heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some risk factors are not modifiable such as age, sex, ethnicity, family history of stroke, genetics and certain inherited conditions. Women, for example, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9911842/"&gt;particularly susceptible to strokes&lt;/a&gt; – and women of all ages are more likely than men to die from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.018415"&gt;Stroke risks unique to women&lt;/a&gt; include pregnancy and some contraceptive pills (especially for smokers), as well as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/endometriosis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73093" data-postid="155781" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, premature ovarian failure (before 40 years of age), early-onset menopause (before 45 years of age) and estrogen for transgender women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJBsV93T1Sg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, inherited vascular abnormalities such as &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/around-3-of-us-will-develop-a-brain-aneurysm-in-our-lives-so-what-is-it-and-how-do-you-treat-it-248882"&gt;cerebral aneurysms&lt;/a&gt; – a weakness in the artery wall – can increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559173/"&gt;hemorrhagic stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some risk factors are social rather than biological, however. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09580-x"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that people with a lower income and education level are at a higher risk of having a stroke. This is due to a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking, heavier drinking and lower physical activity levels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75822-y"&gt;are more common&lt;/a&gt; in people with lower incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)00200-8/abstract"&gt;research also shows&lt;/a&gt; that people with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive good quality healthcare than people with higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, regardless of biological or social risk factors, there are things you can do – right now – to reduce your risk of having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Essential eight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stop smoking&lt;/strong&gt; Smokers are &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/smoking-and-cardiovascular-disease"&gt;more than twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a stroke than non-smokers. Smoking causes damage to blood vessel walls, increases blood pressure and heart rate but reduces oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking also causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/heart-disease-stroke.html"&gt;blood to become sticky&lt;/a&gt;, further increasing the risk of blood clots that can block blood vessels and cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Keep blood pressure in check&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441708/"&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; damages the walls of blood vessels, making them weaker and more prone to rupture or blockage. It can also cause blood clots to form, which can then travel to the brain and block blood flow, leading to a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 18 years of age, get your blood pressure checked regularly so, if you do show signs of developing high blood pressure, you can nip it in the bud and make appropriate changes to your lifestyle to help reduce your risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep an eye on your cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/managing-risk/high-cholesterol"&gt;UK Stroke Association&lt;/a&gt; your risk of a stroke is nearly three and a half times higher if you have both high cholesterol and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower cholesterol, aim to keep saturated fat – found in fatty meats, butter, cheese, and full-fat dairy – below 7 percent of your daily calories, stay active and maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Watch your blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; High blood glucose levels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561420306002"&gt;are linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of stroke. This is because &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sugar-its-not-just-the-calories-that-are-bad-for-you-56459"&gt;high blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; damages blood vessels, which can lead to blood clots that travel to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce blood glucose levels, try to take regular exercise, eat a balanced diet rich in fiber, drink enough water, maintain a healthy weight, and try &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-remain-youthful-and-resilient-despite-stress-173173"&gt;to manage stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Maintain a healthy weight&lt;/strong&gt; Being overweight is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/stroke/causes"&gt;main risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for stroke. It is associated with almost one in five strokes, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20299666/"&gt;increases your stroke risk by 22 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being obese raises that risk by 64 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#stroke"&gt;Carrying too much weight&lt;/a&gt; increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, which all contribute to higher stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Follow a Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt; One way to eat a fiber-rich balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight is to follow a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/both-statins-and-a-mediterranean-style-diet-can-help-ward-off-heart-disease-and-stroke-64609"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. This has been shown to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-019-00504-7"&gt;reduce the risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;, especially when supplemented with nuts and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjPl7K5vh_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Sleep well&lt;/strong&gt; Try to to get seven to nine hours of sleep daily. Too little sleep &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/health-check-three-reasons-why-sleep-is-important-for-your-health-41176"&gt;can lead to high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most important modifiable risk factors for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much sleep, however, is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945721005505?via%3Dihub"&gt;associated with increased stroke risk&lt;/a&gt;, so try to stay as active as possible so you can sleep as well as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Stay active&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/"&gt;NHS recommends &lt;/a&gt; that people should avoid prolonged sedentary behavior and aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be spread evenly over four to five days a week, or every day. Do strengthening activities, usually more than two days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that while the effects of stroke can be devastating and life-changing, it is largely preventable. Adopting these eight simple lifestyle changes can help to reduce stroke risk and optimize both heart and brain health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251524/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Brenner told MTN News that 32-year-old Tranyelle Harshman also had a regular amount of clonazepam, an anti-anxiety drug, in her system. Family and friends have said she was suffering from post-partum depression when she killed her children at their home in Byron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine was developed in the 1960s as an anesthetic used by soldiers injured on the battlefield. It's used today as treatment for severe depression, but health experts note it can come with serious and sometimes hallucinogenic side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxicology reports also indicated Harshman's four children all had high amounts of propranolol and diphenhydramine, both of which cause drowsiness, in their systems, according to Brenner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head for all four girls. The two youngest, Jordan Basil Harshman and Brooke Seline Harshman, and a 9-year-old, Braylee Shae Blackmer, died at the scene. The fourth daughter, 7-year-old Olivia Harshman, died days later at a Salt Lake City hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said T&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.ktvq.com/news/crime-watch/wyoming-mom-shoots-4-daughters-and-calls-911-before-shooting-herself" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;ranyelle Harshman called 911 to report she had shot the four girls before turning the gun on herself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At least 40 patients have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Neighboring &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico reported 42 cases&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. Twenty of the people in New Mexico were ages 18 or older, eight were 4 or younger. And as of Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma had confirmed four cases&lt;/a&gt; related to the outbreak. All were either unvaccinated or it was unclear if they had gotten the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two people, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-vaccine-influencers-weaponized-measles-death-texas-rcna196900" target="_blank"&gt;6-year-old girl in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and an adult in New Mexico, have died. The epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas, has one of the state’s highest vaccine exemption rates, at nearly 18%, according to&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" target="_blank"&gt; health department data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccine clinics have been set up in the county, but uptake hasn’t been robust, Wells said. Many families in the area remain steadfast in long debunked fears that vaccines cause autism, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Now is the time, Wells said during Tuesday’s briefing, for health departments across the country to boost their vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Measles is going to find those pockets of unvaccinated individuals, and with the number of cases and ability for people to travel, there is that risk of it entering other unvaccinated pockets anywhere in the United States right now,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DataTable?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas has reported 10 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in three counties that border Oklahoma. Those cases haven’t been officially linked to the ongoing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cases linked not to the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; but to international travel have been reported in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Measles will find a way to continue transmitting until it runs out of a susceptible population,” said Dr. Brian Borah, medical director for vaccine-preventable diseases surveillance at the Chicago Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The only thing that’s going to stop a national outbreak is a massive effort to find people who aren’t vaccinated and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-parents-vaccinate-rcna193637" target="_blank"&gt;get them the shots as soon as possible&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Simbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said during Tuesday’s briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The duration of the outbreak is dependent on your ability to identify everyone who is vulnerable, determine if they have been exposed, and then how quickly vaccination starts,” Ige said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, Ige’s team faced a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/chicago-measles-cases-migrant-shelter-rcna142801" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately infected 64 people, mostly associated with a housing shelter in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The health department enlisted community health workers and other trusted members in the area, such as politicians and faith leaders, to encourage vaccination, Borah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We put people in the shelter who we knew were trusted messengers,” he said. Nearly everyone who hadn’t been vaccinated got the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Within two months, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html" target="_blank"&gt;the outbreak was over.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How the virus develops and causes symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or even breathes, tiny viral particles are hurled through the air — and stay there, floating around for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If I’m just sitting in my office and talking, I’m spewing virus around,” said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and the city’s top health official, explaining how easily measles spreads. “If my door is open, that virus can leave my office and go out into the hallway. Somebody walking up and down the hallway can get infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Once a person is infected, the virus quietly multiplies in the body for about seven to 14 days without causing symptoms. This is called the incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Around day 10 or 11, the body’s immune system becomes overwhelmed and symptoms develop, including a cough, runny nose, high fevers up to 103 and 104 degrees and inflamed, red eyes. “Think of pink eye, but worse,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Then, small, white dots called Koplik spots show up in the mouth and spread into the lungs, causing inflammation. That’s why babies and small children in particular are at risk for trouble breathing. Their tiny airways can’t handle so much inflammation. At this point, the virus can cause bacterial pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not until several days later that the characteristic measles rash begins — angry, red splotches that start at the top of the head and work their way down the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By that time, the patient has already infected vulnerable people. An infected person spreads the virus four days before the rash ever shows up, as well as four days after. That’s why it’s a mistake, Cook said, to think of measles as “just a rash.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles vaccination guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/have-you-had-your-measles-shot-learn-if-you-need-n996096" target="_blank"&gt;MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; are 97% effective in preventing infection, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The first dose is given at around age 1, offering 93% protection, but the second isn’t given until around age 5, when a child enters kindergarten. That leaves kids slightly vulnerable for the several years they are in between doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The general rules change, however, during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Doctors have the option of giving the second dose early if a child has been exposed to the virus. Pediatricians can give the vaccine to babies at least 6 months old, doctors say, but they will still need the two standard doses when they’re old enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 21:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOdjVtdFN0bW1pdm9MTUJYczB2c0E2TEFMeC0xZ2lsbmd1RWduLW5VR2FpYXBHanlMRTZDNUtpWXZlTE5Vb3U0MUxDOEprM0E1NWxqUWlDT0dvWTk3X253cTVlMm1kUE9YcE5fWmdGaGYwMkwtVnRNeEtXSXVHVkJJSk9ES2wtR1NTeWlBYndYZGlPM25iX0R6YS1vSWNsS2gyU3hPcTV6TTZEekVUWHRuLWhMOTBPbl9rZWVpZFlhc0dOQdIBVkFVX3lxTE1SdzgyT3pXa242SHlZM25zeFgxNHJxVGd6aVRoLVN1NnhULVRXdklOQ3c1NXpsTFk3b0Z3RXQzeEZ6STdNd01OZzZvaUtENk9aU1NIVUZB</guid></item><item><title>Measles arrives in Kansas, spreads quickly in undervaccinated counties - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxOM1lPTjh1TzBvTjFkWDM3VVBGYmJWS2tlSVBHVXJWVTAycUY4Q0F6X1h4Ym9FODZCV0hRY0ZhdFBPeXhPenl2dXRZZVdNaVhmSDEyTVhZZzB0ZTItVmlUb1hiS0ZTam9NNm1YV2FZRUJfNWRDanlvOEh1Wi11WlhxaXFESHdldVZvQ2FMQ3BBTW9JeUZLaXVCLWtSX09hdFN4RDlORGFjaE9Cekh6cXhHbWFuTEpaZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the county on the northern border of Stevens, Grant County, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0uJqqfNbQYF3UD23EAQ7Q9P6Wc6GkviiwrfakYuVguwSTy34HzPUmNbLdH4dCMB6Jl&amp;amp;id=100068906386981"&gt;also reported three confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, which were also linked to the first case in Stevens. Grant County is in a much better position to handle the outbreak than its neighbors; its one school district, Ulysses, reported 100 percent vaccination coverage for kindergartners in the 2023–2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outbreak risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, details about the fast-rising cases are scant. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has not published another press release about the cases since March 13. Ars Technica reached out to KDHE for more information but did not hear back before this story's publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlet &lt;a href="https://www.kwch.com/2025/03/20/6-measles-cases-reported-kansas-according-kdhe/"&gt;KWCH 12 News out of Wichita published a story Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, when there were just six cases reported in just Grant and Stevens Counties, saying that all six were in unvaccinated people and that no one had been hospitalized. On Friday, KWCH updated the story to note that the case count had increased to 10 and that the health department now considers the situation an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Measles is an extremely infectious virus&lt;/a&gt; that can linger &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html"&gt;in airspace and on surfaces for up to two hours&lt;/a&gt; after an infected person has been in an area. Among unvaccinated people exposed to the virus, 90 percent will become infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have slipped nationwide, creating pockets that have lost herd immunity and are vulnerable to fast-spreading, difficult-to-stop outbreaks. In the past, strong vaccination rates prevented such spread, and in 2000, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;the virus was declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there was no continuous spread of the virus over a 12-month period. Experts now fear that the US will lose its elimination status, meaning measles will once again be considered endemic to the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has documented 378 measles cases as of Thursday, March 20. That figure is already out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;reported 309 cases in its ongoing outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. Forty people have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child with no underlying medical conditions has died. The outbreak has spilled over to New Mexico and Oklahoma. In New Mexico, officials reported Friday that the case count has risen to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;42 cases&lt;/a&gt;, with two hospitalizations and one death in an unvaccinated adult.

In New Mexico, cases have risen to 42, with one measles-related death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While there are more cases of the virus, there is some good news: More people are getting the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination this year than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the CDC, a federal public health agency, the last time measles numbers were this high in the US was 2019 when the annual total was 1,274. But the number of cases each year from 2020 through 2023 were all lower than the number of cases in the first three months of 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the outbreak began, more people are reportedly getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Between 1 February and 18 March last year, the New Mexico Department of Health registered 6,500 measles vaccines, the Associated Press reported. In the same time period this year, more than 11,600 measles vaccines were administered in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Between 1 January and 16 March, Texas gave at least 173, 000 measles doses compared to last year's 158,000 in the same time period, state health department data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Besides the outbreak spreading in Texas and New Mexico, measles cases were reported in other states and across Canada, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So far this year in Canada there have been 224 measles cases, 173 confirmed and 51 probable, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US still sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The two deaths were jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded a measles death since 2015.

      &lt;p&gt;Last Friday was World Sleep Day. Did you miss it? If so, that feels apt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of us feel stuck trying to catch up and sleep better. We've all been told not to look at a screen before bedtime because the light disrupts sleep, right? Surprisingly, researchers have found that the light from screens delayed people's sleep by &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blue-light-smartphone-screen-sleep/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a max of 10 minutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But even if your device's bright light doesn't have a huge effect, spending your day on a computer won't prepare your body for a good night's sleep. One of the surest methods to make sure you can fall asleep faster and stay asleep?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yes, you guessed it: get enough movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A scoping review of sleep research just published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44323-024-00018-w" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cites a &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.2930" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that found this:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Female adults with insomnia who commit to at least half an hour of daily exercise gain 15 additional minutes of sleep compared with those who do not exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As a female adult who has experienced some sleepless nights, I've been tracking my steps for years and my movement-to-sleep ratio has become clear:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less than 10,000 = oof, it's gonna be hard to fall asleep10,000 = decent night's sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12,000 = solid night's sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16,000 and up = I better stretch or my aching back might keep me up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Do you have a magic number?&lt;/p&gt;

(WTVF) — The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed its first measles case this year in Middle Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials only identified the person as a resident and didn't specify whether it was an adult or a child. The likely source of the infection is being investigated, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the person was infected in early March and recovering at home. Public health officials are working to identify other places and people potentially exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently an ongoing, national measles outbreak, involving over 300 cases in 11 states, including two deaths. TDH encourages consultation with your medical provider about measles prevention. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical providers need to report suspected cases immediately to the Tennessee Department of Health at 615-741-7247.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have more information about this story?

This research suggests that targeting the meningeal lymphatics—vessels outside the brain—could be a novel approach to treating age-related cognitive decline without directly crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment reduced levels of the inflammatory protein IL-6 and restored healthy neuronal signaling, alleviating memory loss in older mice. These findings open the door to therapies that enhance brain function by supporting the body’s natural “waste management” system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waste Clearance Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing meningeal lymphatic drainage improved memory in aged mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatment reduced IL-6 levels, restoring healthy brain communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting lymphatic vessels outside the brain could offer non-invasive options for age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As aging bodies decline, the brain loses the ability to cleanse itself of waste, a scenario that scientists think could be contributing to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, among others. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis report they have found a way around that problem by targeting the network of vessels that drain waste from the brain. Rejuvenating those vessels, they have shown, improves memory in old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108225"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/lymphatic-system-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;He found that the older mice with rejuvenated lymphatic vessels spent more time with the new object – an indicator of improved memory – compared with the older mice not given the treatment. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published online March 21 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, lays the groundwork to develop therapies for age-related cognitive decline that overcome the challenges faced by conventional medications that struggle to pass through the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The physical blood-brain barrier hinders the efficacy of therapies for neurological disorders,” said Jonathan Kipnis, PhD, the Alan A. and Edith L. Wolff Distinguished Professor of Pathology &amp;amp; Immunology and a BJC Investigator at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting a network of vessels outside of the brain that is critical for brain health, we see cognitive improvements in mice, opening a window to develop more powerful therapies to prevent or delay cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Waste removal improves memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kipnis is an expert in the blossoming field of neuroimmunology, the study of how the immune system affects the brain in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Kipnis’ lab discovered a network of vessels surrounding the brain — known as the meningeal lymphatics — in mice and humans that drains fluid and waste into the lymph nodes, where many immune system cells reside and monitor for signs of infection, disease or injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and colleagues also have shown that some investigational Alzheimer’s therapies are more effective in mice when paired with a treatment that improves drainage of fluid and debris from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning at about age 50, people start to experience a decline in brain fluid flow as part of normal aging. For the new study, Kipnis collaborated with Marco Colonna, MD, the Robert Rock Belliveau, MD, Professor of Pathology, and asked if enhancing the function of an old drainage system can improve memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the memory of mice, the researchers placed two identical black rods in the cage for twenty minutes for old mice to explore. The next day, the mice received one of the black rods again and a new object, a silver rectangular prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice that remember playing with the black rod will spend more time with the new object. But old mice spend a similar amount of time playing with both objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first author of the new study, Kyungdeok Kim, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Kipnis lab, boosted functioning of the lymphatic vessels in old mice with a treatment that stimulates vessel growth, enabling more waste to drain out of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found that the older mice with rejuvenated lymphatic vessels spent more time with the new object – an indicator of improved memory – compared with the older mice not given the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A functioning lymphatic system is critical for brain health and memory,” said Kim. “Therapies that support the health of the body’s waste management system may have health benefits for a naturally aging brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brain’s overwhelmed cleaning crew&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the lymphatic system is so impaired that waste builds up in the brain, the burden of cleaning falls to the brain’s resident immune cells, called microglia. But this local cleaning crew fails to keep up with the mess and gets exhausted, Kipnis explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that the overwhelmed cells produce a distress signal, an immune protein called interleukin 6, or IL-6, that acts on brain cells to promote cognitive decline in mice with damaged lymphatic vessels. Examining the brains of such mice, the researchers found that neurons had an imbalance in the types of signals they receive from surrounding brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, neurons received fewer signals that function like noise-canceling headphones among the cacophony of neuron communications. This imbalance, caused by increased IL-6 levels in the brain, led to changes in how the brain is wired and affected proper brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to improving memory in the aged mice, the lymphatic vessel-boosting treatment also caused levels of IL-6 to drop, restoring the noise-canceling system of the brain. The findings point to the potential of improving the health of the brain’s lymphatic vessels to preserve or restore cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we mark the 10th anniversary of our discovery of the brain’s lymphatic system, these new findings provide insight into the importance of this system for brain health,” said Kipnis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting the more easily accessible lymphatic vessels that are located outside the brain may prove to be an exciting new frontier in the treatment of brain disorders.

IL-6 drives inhibitory synapse phenotypes via a combination of &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;– and classical IL-6 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring meningeal lymphatic function in aged mice reverses age-associated synaptic and behavioral alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics adversely impact cortical circuitry through an IL-6-dependent mechanism and identify a potential target for treating aging-associated cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 20:07:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5mVnR0SmdmU21LMVJIYTRkS2ZYMTJWTGowQ0NvTE90Skc0Z2tTUmJycDV4YmNWeFkxYXRDcDBEbFpqMFh0YkN0S0tEVWdsNFFuSnNnZjQ4VnUzcGpmQU9IWlNTaVdFZHlZR0FNVGppMUVzZEE</guid></item><item><title>Sleep Apnea Has Been Linked to a Higher Parkinson’s Risk—But This Treatment Could Lower It - Health.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9jLWhJS3htRTBnN2puNUktSVpJZ0Vta0IwWXh1ZjYzUG5RREowazFTaWpJYnV2UHVQY0JKNWd1V1NOOFhOcXFfSXRha3RLSldCSFhiaVVCdmV6RF92V0NnemprempfYmcwdGRaWWlvSlU2dmV6dllHVEk4MTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many people with sleep apnea, sleeping in a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine is less than ideal. However, the device could protect neurological health, a new study suggests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to preliminary data released on March 2, starting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/cpap-machine-7370334" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;CPAP treatment&lt;/a&gt; within two years of an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/obstructive-sleep-apnea-8418380" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis could reduce the risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting in San Diego from April 5-9, but it has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A growing body of evidence suggests that sleep apnea and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/parkinsons-disease-overview-7095529" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are connected—about four in 10 people with Parkinson’s have also been diagnosed with this sleep disorder.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While our study found an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease, the good news is people can do something about it, by using CPAP as soon as they are diagnosed with the sleep disorder,” study author &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/providers/gregory-scott-md-phd" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Gregory Scott, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, staff physician at the Veterans Affairs Portland Health Care System, &lt;a href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/sleep-apnea-linked-to-increased-risk-of-parkinson-s-but-cpap-may-reduce-risk" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a press release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 30 million Americans are estimated to have OSA, but only 6 million have been diagnosed. Of those who have been diagnosed, most don't stick with CPAP use long-term.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what experts had to say about the new research, how sleep apnea, CPAP use, and Parkinson’s might be linked, and tips for lowering your risk of health issues related to this sleep disorder.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-investigating-how-cpap-use-could-lower-parkinsons-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have OSA, it means you have a blocked airway during sleep, which makes it hard for your body to get enough oxygen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It can also lead to &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/sleep-apnea-symptoms-7095061" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as snoring or gasping for breath. The CPAP machine can counteract these issues—the device includes a mask that goes over the nose and mouth, pushing air into the airways to keep them open.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To further investigate how this sleep apnea treatment might have an effect on a person’s neurological health long-term, researchers examined 20 years of medical records from over 1.5 million U.S. veterans with OSA. They compared those records to data from 9.7 million veterans who didn’t have the condition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, after adjusting for factors such as age, sex, and smoking, the team found that there were 1.8 more cases of Parkinson’s disease per 1,000 people in the OSA group as compared to the non-OSA group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From there, the study authors zeroed in on the 10% of OSA patients who used a CPAP machine. Though they didn’t have information about how frequently people used the devices, they split people with sleep apnea into two groups: CPAP users who started treatment within two years of their diagnosis and CPAP users who received the machine after two years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who started using their CPAP late saw a relatively similar rate of Parkinson’s disease as those who didn’t use a CPAP at all. However, starting CPAP treatment within two years of diagnosis was linked to a lower Parkinson’s rate—there were 2.3 fewer cases per 1,000 people in comparison to those who didn’t use a CPAP.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These results suggest that “OSA may be an important, modifiable risk factor for the development of [Parkinson’s disease],” the study authors concluded.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-is-parkinsons-connected-to-how-you-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite evidence of a link between the two, experts aren’t totally sure if sleep apnea raises your Parkinson’s disease risk—or if it’s the other way around.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Whether sleep apnea can increase the risk of Parkinson’s is not clear,” &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/expmed/dr-marta-kaminska" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Marta Kaminska, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a Parkinson’s researcher and associate professor of medicine at McGill University, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, she said, “some studies have found that people diagnosed with sleep apnea have a higher chance of being diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the years following the sleep apnea diagnosis.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep apnea makes breathing harder during sleep, reduces blood oxygen levels, and causes fragmented sleep. That can, in turn, drive &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/oxidative-stress-8661281" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/inflammation-7480642" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, changes in blood vessel function, impaired waste clearance from the brain, injury to neurons, and altered brain function, Kaminska explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other research has found that this lack of blood in oxygen may indirectly lead to changes in brain proteins associated with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, it’s well known that Parkinson’s can cause sleep disturbances, which can start before the Parkinson’s is diagnosed. Some people may be diagnosed with sleep apnea but find their sleep changes were due to Parkinson’s all along, Kaminska noted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it’s difficult for researchers to parse out what’s actually behind this link, she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sleep apnea is common in Parkinson’s disease, but then, it is common in older adults anyway. So [we] don’t know if it is the Parkinson’s disease or age [that could cause sleep apnea],” &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsd.edu/sonia.ancoli-israel" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sonia Ancoli-Israel, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, sleep apnea researcher and professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, told &lt;em&gt;Health.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For people who do have both conditions, evidence shows that sleep apnea can speed up Parkinson's patients' decline in motor function and cognitive function, worsen &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-8404504" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive daytime sleepiness&lt;/a&gt;, and increase their risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-importance-of-treating-sleep-apnea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because sleep apnea is linked to a slew of health issues—including a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart attack, dementia, and more—treating it is critical.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/sleep-apnea-treatment-7095704" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other strategies beyond CPAP&lt;/a&gt;, including surgery, positional therapy, and nerve stimulation. However, CPAP is usually the most recommended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “CPAP therapy can correct sleep apnea completely,” said Kaminska.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, many people struggle to tolerate the CPAP machine, complaining of uncomfortable masks, skin inflammation, air leaks, claustrophobia, nasal congestion, and difficulty exhaling.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One report estimates that just 34% of people with OSA used their CPAP machines for seven hours a night; overall, adherence can range from 30% and 60%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “[CPAP] needs to be used every night,” said Ancoli-Israel. “That comfort depends totally on getting the right mask.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most doctors do recommend that people with CPAP machines use them all night for the best health outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But even some use is beneficial.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Importantly, Ancoli-Israel said, treating sleep apnea promptly may not be the key contributor to &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/condition/parkinsons-disease/parkinsons-disease-causes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing Parkinson’s risk&lt;/a&gt;—exercising, eating well, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake might also play a role.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you suspect you might have sleep apnea, talk to a healthcare provider to &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/sleep-apnea-diagnosis-7095703" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;get diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; and treated as quickly as you can.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Using advanced imaging in mice, researchers found that the same dendritic branches are activated when closely timed experiences are encoded, effectively binding the memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery explains why events from the same day often feel connected, while those from weeks apart seem more isolated. The findings offer new insight into how memories are organized and may inform therapies for memory-related disorders like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dendritic Memory Linking:&lt;/strong&gt; Memories formed close in time are stored in the same dendritic branches, creating physical links between them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice exposed to two environments in quick succession linked them behaviorally, freezing in both after a shock in just one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding dendritic memory encoding could lead to new approaches for treating memory-related disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve ever noticed how memories from the same day seem connected while events from weeks apart feel separate, a new study reveals the reason: Our brains physically link memories that occur close in time not in the cell bodies of neurons, but rather in their spiny extensions called dendrites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery stems from studies in mice, in which researchers observed memory formation using advanced imaging techniques, including miniature microscopes that captured single-cell resolution in live animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108221"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This is a drawing of a neuron and dendrites." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/memory-dendrites-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dendritic spine clusters formed after the first memory were more likely to attract new spines during a second closely timed memory, physically linking those experiences in the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that memories are stored in dendritic compartments: When one memory forms, the affected dendrites are primed to capture new information arriving within the next few hours, linking memories formed close in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you think of a neuron as a computer, dendrites are like tiny computers inside it, each performing its own calculations,” said lead author Megha Sehgal, assistant professor of psychology at The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery shows that our brains can link information arriving close in time to the same dendritic location, expanding our understanding of how memories are organized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most learning and memory studies have focused on how a single memory is formed in the brain, Sehgal’s lab aims to determine how we organize multiple memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that we don’t form memories in isolation. You don’t form a single memory. You use that memory, make a framework of memories, and then pull from that framework when you need to make adaptive decisions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons, the principal brain cells, are known to encode and relay information. Dendrites – the branch-like projections extending from neurons – serve a critical role in how information is processed, receiving incoming information and passing it to the neuronal cell body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But dendrites are not just passive conduits – each dendritic branch can act as an independent computational unit. While dendrites have been thought to play an important role in the brain’s function, how they shape learning and memory has been unclear until now, Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mice were exposed in experiments to two different environments within a short period of time, the team found that memories of these spaces became linked. If mice received a mild shock in one of these spaces, the animals ended up freezing out of fear in both environments, associating the shock from one room with the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a brain region crucial for spatial and contextual memory. The researchers observed that linked memories consistently engaged the same groups of RSC neurons and their dendritic branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tracked these changes at the dendritic level by visualizing dendritic spines, tiny protrusions on dendrites where neurons communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formation of new memories triggered the addition of clustered dendritic spines, a process critical for strengthening communication between neurons and facilitating learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spine clusters formed after the first memory were more likely to attract new spines during a second closely timed memory, physically linking those experiences in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm the role of dendrites in linking memories, the team used optogenetics, a technique that allows researchers to control neurons with light. By reactivating specific dendritic segments that had been active during memory formation, they were able to link otherwise unrelated memories, further demonstrating the importance of dendritic changes in shaping memory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to illuminating a previously unknown role for dendrites in linking memories, the findings open new avenues for understanding memory-related disorders, Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work not only expands our understanding of how memories are formed but also suggests exciting new possibilities for manipulating higher order memory processes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could have implications for developing therapies for memory-related conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sehgal co-led the study with Alcino Silva, director of the Integrative Center for Learning and Memory at UCLA, and Panayiota Poirazi, research director of the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Aging, the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

However, the role of dendritic plasticity mechanisms in linking memories is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that memory linking is dependent not only on neuronal ensemble overlap in the mouse retrosplenial cortex, but also on branch-specific dendritic allocation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same dendritic segments are preferentially activated by two linked (but not independent) contextual memories, and spine clusters added after each of two linked (but not independent) contextual memories are allocated to the same dendritic segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we show that the reactivation of dendrites activated during the first context exploration is sufficient to link two contextual memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate a critical role for localized dendritic plasticity in memory integration and reveal rules governing how linked and independent memories are allocated to dendritic compartments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 19:52:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5uYWg3RjkwWkZNM2NSdC1QNUxVVk11UlJuS0g1OXRsdFlTRmRVNGp4QnVidXV3UkVkNTZ6RkVGMVNwY2VMYnk4Si0xa2E2SG9sdWo3NXA0QjY3eUplYW1WazFwcDhmell1bEVZRXY4UQ</guid></item><item><title>“Infantile amnesia” occurs despite babies showing memory activity - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPYTRMbHZQeXg4eVM4V19HU1BSaW1lbjVCelhTby1iWFRrM3dpTGdQN05seUtpVTZfWGU5TXZUSWI1MjZSWld3ampob0JNTXdqT05lS3BPRjEzUzZlT0U1dFYwall3aFpWaVc5Q25pcXFTV2ZEVVAtUC1EcWc1SzBFQndMUWU4N0NNcHFhWVo4SXhfSi11cVJhQVRUYkZ2ajA4M0RQUEpIMUFRekVod2ZfRg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;For many of us, memories of our childhood have become a bit hazy, if not vanishing entirely. But nobody really remembers much before the age of 4, because nearly all humans experience what's termed "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia"&gt;infantile amnesia&lt;/a&gt;," in which memories that might have formed before that age seemingly vanish as we move through adolescence. And it's not just us; the phenomenon appears to occur in a number of our fellow mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest explanation for this would be that the systems that form long-term memories are simply immature and don't start working effectively until children hit the age of 4. But a recent animal experiment suggests that the situation in mice is more complex: the memories are there, they're just not normally accessible, although they can be re-activated. Now, a study that put human infants in an MRI tube suggests that memory activity starts by the age of 1, suggesting that the results in mice may apply to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less than total recall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice are one of the species that we know experience infantile amnesia. And, thanks to over a century of research on mice, we have some sophisticated genetic tools that allow us to explore what's actually involved in the apparent absence of the animals' earliest memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg9921"&gt;paper that came out last year&lt;/a&gt; describes a series of experiments that start by having very young mice learn to associate seeing a light come on with receiving a mild shock. If nothing else is done with those mice, that association will apparently be forgotten later in life due to infantile amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this case, the researchers could do something. Neural activity normally results in the activation of a set of genes. In these mice, the researchers engineered it so one of the genes that gets activated encodes a protein that can modify DNA. When this protein is made, it results in permanent changes to a second gene that was inserted in the animal's DNA. Once activated through this process, the gene leads to the production of a light-activated ion channel.&lt;/p&gt;

This paradox appears to be driven by increased protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in the mushroom body, a brain region responsible for memory and sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study suggests that heightened memory performance may come at the cost of sleep and lifespan, hinting at a deeper evolutionary trade-off. Researchers also draw potential links to autism, as the molecular pathways involved in these fruit fly mutants resemble mechanisms tied to neurodevelopmental disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced memory in sleep mutants:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruit flies with sleep deficits outperform controls in memory tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PKA signaling role:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated PKA activity mediates both memory enhancement and sleep suppression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism connection:&lt;/strong&gt; Mutations in the same pathway are linked to traits seen in autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruit fly mutants that have severe sleep deficits perform better at olfactory learning and memory tasks, according to a study published March 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;by Sheng Huang and Stephan Sigrist from Freie Universität Berlin, Germany, and colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paradox of enhanced memory despite sleep loss could be explained by protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in the mushroom body of the fly brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108217"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/sleep-memory-insomnia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;However, a reduction of PKA signaling further increased their excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a dynamic process conserved from invertebrates to mammals and humans. Although sleep is thought to serve many purposes, it is often studied for its restorative roles, which are believed to optimize lifespan and cognition. The fruit fly &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; has long been used to study associative learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mushroom body in the fly brain plays essential roles in both memory and sleep regulation. Yet it remains unclear how signaling in the fly mushroom body controls the balance between memory function and sleep levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Huang, Sigrist, and colleagues examined this question using &lt;em&gt;Drosophila insomniac&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt;) short sleep mutants. The &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants showed robustly increased performance in olfactory learning and memory, despite their severe sleep deficits. A screen for genetic modifiers revealed that the PKA signaling pathway specifically mediates the sleep deficits of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated PKA signaling also contributes to the shorter life expectancy of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants. However, a reduction of PKA signaling further increased their excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants displayed higher PKA signaling, the researchers propose that this mutation in the &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; gene suppresses sleep via increased PKA activity in the mushroom body, which also constrains the excessive memory of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this elevated PKA signaling restricts excessive memory, it comes at the cost of reduced sleep levels and shortened lifespan in &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, the findings reveal a signaling cascade for balancing sleep and memory functions, and provide a plausible explanation for the sleep patterns of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants, suggesting that enhanced memory can provoke sleep deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, behavioral hyperfunction, coupled with sleep deficits and cognitive imbalances, mirrors hallmark traits of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Inc functions as an adaptor protein for Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase, and Cullin-3 mutations have been associated with autism spectrum disorder, the findings provide a potential mechanistic connection between neurodevelopmental hyperfunction and the origins of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Enhanced memory resulting from developmental neural circuit overgrowth: autism-related &lt;em&gt;Drosophila insomniac&lt;/em&gt; mutants promote PKA signaling to suppress their excessive memory function, and consequently trigger severe sleep loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#593b303635363e20292b3c2a2a192935362a77362b3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Enhanced memory despite severe sleep loss in Drosophila insomniac mutants&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephan Sigrist et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced memory despite severe sleep loss in Drosophila insomniac mutants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is crucial for cognitive functions and life span across species. While sleep homeostasis and cognitive processes are linked through cellular and synaptic plasticity, the signaling pathways connecting them remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that &lt;em&gt;Drosophila insomniac&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt;) short sleep mutants, which lack an adaptor protein for the autism-associated Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase, exhibited enhanced Pavlovian aversive olfactory learning and memory, unlike other sleep mutants with normal or reduced memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a genetic modifier screen, we found that a mild reduction of Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling specifically rescued the sleep and longevity phenotypes of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this reduction further increased their excessive memory and mushroom body overgrowth. Since &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants displayed higher PKA signaling, we propose that &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; loss-of-function suppresses sleep via increased PKA activity, which also constrains the excessive memory of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data identify a signaling cascade for balancing sleep and memory functions, and provide a plausible explanation for the sleep phenotypes of &lt;em&gt;inc&lt;/em&gt; mutants, suggesting that memory hyperfunction can provoke sleep deficits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 19:39:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBnaXRtY0lfNXJIVFE0SFlMX2ROc3p1SjhWTzR5SzE0U1d2cTZLY01pa0trc3k4a1V0R0VlLS1pcEdVRGVuNUdVZVhyY3RTcE5uQnlQb0U4Z29wSThMSVZXX3RMTEY1QQ</guid></item><item><title>Texas Measles Outbreak May Continue for a Year, Officials Say - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUERUVDFCWTRWSlFNLVdyWjBJaGdMWHVJem9nUmktXzRiMjVnNWtJQ0MzVWdUT1B3UU5SSTQtUGNLUUVSdW8tdm1IWmk0VDFmREltVDc1YmI2MG1iNE41SjhWVk13ckpSQUpiNmk4Y0JHcnc2ZDlOeXQ3bzF5a0tJeTBKcXZjSGswNnV2LW5PS2lYUTQ5bUVpdVduNDRvZl9TNGpIMVZzZGdNZlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 19:11:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQUERUVDFCWTRWSlFNLVdyWjBJaGdMWHVJem9nUmktXzRiMjVnNWtJQ0MzVWdUT1B3UU5SSTQtUGNLUUVSdW8tdm1IWmk0VDFmREltVDc1YmI2MG1iNE41SjhWVk13ckpSQUpiNmk4Y0JHcnc2ZDlOeXQ3bzF5a0tJeTBKcXZjSGswNnV2LW5PS2lYUTQ5bUVpdVduNDRvZl9TNGpIMVZzZGdNZlk</guid></item><item><title>Colorado pet owners warned about deadly virus that's killed 91% of cats with known infections - The Denver Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;All Colorado cat owners should be aware of a recent warning from the Colorado Department of Agriculture that was issued following the deaths of 10 pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Colorado Department of Argiculture, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza has been detected in 11 domestic cats in recent days and weeks, with a single cat of that group surviving the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cats who have been found to have the virus spanned both indoor and outdoor cats, with the virus believed to be connected to the consumption of raw pet food and raw poultry. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to avoid feeding raw poultry products to domestic cats. Extra caution is also urged for those handling raw pet food or raw poultry, including instruction to ensure hands are thoroughly washed and surfaces are disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting a cat's contact with dead animals can also be important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that while the recent press release was related to cats, dogs can be susceptible to the virus, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza infects a cat, the animal can start to experience a fever and lethargy, as well as discharge from eyes and nose, respiratory issues, and neurological issues. It can rapidly lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional information about the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza outbreak can be found &lt;a href="https://ag.colorado.gov/animal-health/reportable-diseases/avian-influenza/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of a romantic relationship usually does not come out of the blue but is indicated one or two years before the breakup. As the results of a psychological study have demonstrated, the terminal stage of a relationship consists of two phases. First, there is a gradual decline in relationship satisfaction, reaching a transition point one to two years before the dissolution of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;"From this transition point onwards, there is a rapid deterioration in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/relationship+satisfaction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;relationship satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;. Couples in question then move towards separation," said Professor Janina Bühler from the Institute of Psychology at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU). She conducted the corresponding investigation in collaboration with Professor Ulrich Orth of the University of Bern. Their paper was recently &lt;a href="https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/pspp0000551" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis built on national studies from Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a common fact that satisfaction in a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/romantic+relationship/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;romantic relationship&lt;/a&gt; declines over time. This reduction in satisfaction is particularly marked in the first years of a relationship, and a distinctive low point is often reached after a period of 10 years. Instead of considering the processes that occur in the time-since-beginning of a romantic relationship, Janina Bühler and Ulrich Orth decided to look at the time-to-separation of relationships for the purposes of their research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in view, they used data from four representative studies conducted in Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. All these countries are WEIRD, i.e., Western, Educated, Industrialized, Educated, Rich, Democratic, and their individuals are free—by law—to decide about their relationship status. For each of the four data sets, covering a total of 11,295 individuals, there was a control group roughly the same size consisting of couples that had not separated.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/surveys/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;surveys&lt;/a&gt; in the four countries were conducted over different periods of time, ranging from 12 to 21 years. In the case of Germany, the researchers employed the data of the Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam), a multidisciplinary longitudinal study. In all countries, the subjects were asked to specify how satisfied they were right then with their existing romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the available data, Bühler and Orth assessed the extent to which the satisfaction with the relationship developed in the light of their subsequent separation. "In order to better understand dissolving relationships, we examined them from the point of view of time-to-separation. To do this, we applied a concept that is in general use in other fields of psychology," said Bühler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the data of the four national representative studies, the researchers were able to determine that relationships can be subjected to what is known as terminal decline. This decline in relationship satisfaction occurs in two phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial preterminal phase, which can have a duration of several years, is characterized by a minor decline in satisfaction. However, this is followed by a transition or tipping point from which there is an accelerated decline in satisfaction. The terminal phase of a relationship after this transition point lasts 7 to 28 months, one to two years on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once this terminal phase is reached, the relationship is doomed to come to an end. This is apparent from the fact that only the individuals in the separation group go through this terminal phase, not the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt;," explained Bühler.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Partners assess the terminal phase of a relationship differently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the two &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/partners/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;partners&lt;/a&gt; do not experience the transition phase in the same way. The partner who initiates the separation has already become dissatisfied with the relationship at an earlier point in time. For the recipient of the separation, the transition point arrives relatively shortly before the actual separation. They experience a very rapid decline in relationship satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Partners pass through various phases. They do not normally separate from one day to the next, and the way these phases impact on the two partners differs," added Bühler. In many cases, couples seek help too late, i.e., when the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/transition+point/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;transition point&lt;/a&gt; has already been reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is thus important to be aware of these relationship patterns. Initiating measures in the preterminal &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/phase/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;phase&lt;/a&gt; of a relationship, i.e., before it begins to go rapidly downhill, may thus be more effective and even contribute to preserving the relationship," concluded Bühler, who also works as a couples therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While just 49 people with MS received the device, the researchers nonetheless noted that this was, to their knowledge, the largest study of its kind involving MS patients, with follow-up of slightly longer than six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, SNM was found to have “sustained efficacy” in easing bladder dysfunction in 51% of the MS patients in the study, with “just over half of patients … [continuing] to perceive benefit from their therapy over an average follow-up duration of just over 6 years,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772973725000074#sec5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sacral neuromodulation outcomes in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms in multiple sclerosis patients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Continence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;As many as 4 of every 5 MS patients experience bladder dysfunction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 4 of every 5 people with MS experience some form of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/urinary-incontinence-ms/"&gt;bladder dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, also called LUTS, for lower urinary tract symptoms. Common issues due to LUTS range from an overactive bladder, or the need to urinate very frequently or urgently, and an inability to hold in urine, known as incontinence, to trouble starting urination, and incomplete emptying of the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS-related bladder problems can be managed with medications and other treatments, such as physical therapy to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder, bowel, and uterus in women. Lifestyle changes related to diet or fluid intake may also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNM, also called sacral nerve stimulation, is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which a device implanted in the body delivers mild electrical pulses to the sacral nerves. These nerves extend from the base of the spinal cord through the sacrum, the triangular bone at the base of the spine, into various parts of the lower body, including the bladder and bowels. In many patients, SNM has been shown to be effective in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10359216/"&gt;managing bowel incontinence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little has been detailed, however, about the success of SNM in managing bladder dysfunction in people with MS. To learn more, a team led by U.S. researchers reviewed the medical records of 58 MS patients who sought to undergo the procedure between 2013 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 51, or nearly 90%, of the patients were women. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;Relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; was the most common &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;MS type&lt;/a&gt;, seen for 66%, followed by &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;, diagnosed for 17%. The most common indication for SNM was urinary urgency and frequency, affecting 69%. Nonobstructive urinary retention — when the bladder can’t empty despite no physical blockage in the urinary tract — was seen for the remaining 31%. The mean follow-up was 6.1 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients (71%) also underwent urodynamic testing, which assesses the function of the bladder and urethra in storing and releasing urine. The most prevalent finding was an overactive or underactive bladder muscle, called the detrusor muscle. Detrusor sphincter dysynergia, the lack of coordination between the bladder muscle and the urethral sphincter during urination, was also found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sacral neuromodulation indicated for patients with certain urinary problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients underwent preliminary testing to assess whether they might benefit from permanently implanting a pulse generator (IPG), the device that delivers electrical pulses in SNM. This included peripheral nerve evaluation, in which a thin wire was temporarily placed near the sacral nerves, or the placement of a single permanent wire. Patients were eligible for permanent IPG placement if the preliminary testing reduced urinary dysfunction by at least 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, 49 of the 58 patients (85%) progressed from the preliminary testing phase to IPG implantation, which occurred at a higher rate among those with urinary urgency and frequency than urinary retention (95% vs. 61%). The implantation rate was 56% for patients with detrusor underactivity and 100% for detrusor sphincter dysynergia, but it was similar regardless of preliminary testing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with nonobstructive urinary retention were less likely to receive the IPG implant, while those with a higher body mass index, or body fat content based on height and weight, were more likely to do so. No relationship was identified between IPG implant rates and MS type, urodynamic data, medication use, or prior catheter use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;SNM [sacral neuromodulation] is an effective treatment option for LUTS [lower urinary tract symptoms] associated with MS, … [though] many patients will experience declining efficacy as time progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 49 patients who received the IPG implant, SNM continued to be effective in easing bladder dysfunction in half (51%), while the other half reported decreased efficacy over time, the data showed. Still, no factors were found to predict sustained efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that “this patient cohort represents the largest [group] of MS patients undergoing SNM therapy to date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the team concluded that “SNM is an effective treatment option for LUTS associated with MS,” though they noted that “many patients will experience declining efficacy as time progresses regardless of indication for implantation.”&lt;/p&gt;

He famously – &lt;a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/deconstructing-harry"&gt;and controversially&lt;/a&gt; – showed that rhesus monkeys would rather cling to a surrogate “mother” made of soft cloth than one made of metal wire that provided milk. A loving touch seemed to be more important than food, Harlow concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the importance of touch has become firmly embedded in infant care. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/baby-friendly-resources/implementing-standards-resources/skin-to-skin-contact/"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/start-for-life/baby/baby-basics/caring-for-your-baby/skin-to-skin-contact-with-your-newborn/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommend skin-to-skin contact between a parent and newborn. This involves placing a newborn on a parent’s bare chest, both of them covered in a warm blanket, for at least an hour after birth or until after the first feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, feeling the power of touch begins long before a baby is even born. Touch is the first sense to develop. Just &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-88-470-5373-1"&gt;eight weeks&lt;/a&gt; after conception, a foetus already responds to the sensation of touch in the womb – and it is crucial for people of any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013199"&gt;14 weeks&lt;/a&gt;, twins have been observed on ultrasound sucking on each other’s fingers and exploring each other’s faces. And frame-by-frame analyses of ultrasound have shown that, by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638316302405?casa_token=ejFjZYXCkwQAAAAA:apTuO_ItpJxPBzX08HaMY8E9tpdGSxUBom6PyIQEO6AYTlIIW4rx7fC0_r2RYFAWBB7q4K1ssA"&gt;20 weeks&lt;/a&gt;, foetuses respond to mothers touching their bellies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of parental touch become clear at birth. One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01841-8"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of 52 studies involving over 4,000 newborns found that touch interventions – such as skin-to-skin contact and baby massage – was associated with better newborn health, including better regulation of temperature, breathing and heart rate. The review also found that touch was more beneficial when it came from a parent compared to medical staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuddle up, because there are other benefits of skin-to-skin contact. When a parent holds their baby in skin-to-skin contact after birth, it helps to calm the newborn and stimulates an interest in feeding. In the longer-term, daily skin-to-skin contact with infants &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org.uk/babyfriendly/news-and-research/baby-friendly-research/research-supporting-breastfeeding/skin-to-skin-contact/"&gt;improves&lt;/a&gt; sleep patterns and pain tolerance, supports healthy weight gain and continued breastfeeding and strengthens brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits are also experienced by infants born prematurely. For example, one &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002771/NEONATAL_kangaroo-mother-care-reduce-morbidity-and-mortality-low-birthweight-infants"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of kangaroo care – skin-to-skin contact for premature or low birth-weight infants – found that it reduced the risk of death, infection and low body temperature, and improved weight gain and rates of breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both healthy and premature infants, skin-to-skin contact also triggers the release of the hormone &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7485314/"&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; – the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/oxytocin-the-love-hormone"&gt;“love hormone”&lt;/a&gt; – which encourages bonding between the parent and infant. Skin-to-skin contact also lowers levels of the hormone &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35850037/"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, which helps newborns to regulate levels of stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the benefits of skin-to-skin contact are not exclusively experienced by the newborn. Studies have found that daily skin-to-skin contact with their babies can reduce symptoms of postpartum stress, depression and anxiety in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35063800/"&gt;mothers&lt;/a&gt;. And while most studies have focused on mothers, skin-to-skin contact also seems to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in &lt;a href="https://read.qxmd.com/read/30676465/effects-of-paternal-skin-to-skin-contact-in-newborns-and-fathers-after-cesarean-delivery?gs=0&amp;amp;token=m8oQgqjxpQDP83ZS1f9SM58I31f%2B9KFV8xoqkoWIrIltZ4LUjLezkE8xHei4vqrmjFSYIuXtD7N3B83IXEaBQKPOX2r8O8UtKMY3jG4C%2FY7nPkr7MV3TIiK9OIDN4fqxc%2FFw353AAqPE888AHwpZXdf5yu8DrFR%2FP2NyQTIXyPI6haXZcw%2BF8QBYFD7NZxN%2B1FlZ71vPkJ6P29BfukXseLrTHuo7l2QqxTwpcBvHk10Ehx0%2BXFE8r1dvec3O8uNOLBtfeCkNyO6HhV2cgTyl7OcDfeA3zIiFxcxeuKQBLUnPBXJH5E6eP5fPGdLEB6UBOawGUxyO1U6YUDmzCJ8qGmDBJ5W1Pu0gEwXQgBgBBLV7CPYB%2BEiNfUixYw09CybrxLjXjI1NBEjkV3wNQAuOpw%3D%3D"&gt;fathers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most of this research has focused the short-term outcomes of touch, scientists are also following infants over time to see what impact early touch has on long-term outcomes. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322313007646?casa_token=E2K1YUm4sBwAAAAA:2SrG6HrAugBwthQa2pdrhf6FiJMmSW9yfBhLbsXhLuU4zXhWUOP_hjaWIIFKHelOuTAHqsFMhg"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that premature babies who received at least one hour of kangaroo care for two weeks had better mother-child interactions, sleep and brain development when they were ten years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group of researchers followed infants and their mothers for a period of nine years. When they were only &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311001445?casa_token=dveFHb5RqQIAAAAA:vub1iw7uk9vFqIIrhfnxJQnEns3Gmi77ZpPh6_79-QaRnCGVw3img7kMswmtpUB2oNtzhYkfUA"&gt;one-month-old&lt;/a&gt;, infants who had experienced skin-to-skin contact with their mothers already showed better emotional adjustment and attachment than infants who had no skin-to-skin contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sode.12307?casa_token=1typ_BA15coAAAAA%3Afd-yW7jV1H-zK4GNgAH4Krknglrn_-AkM4-wsVa81325JHb6cMUAfpO0SAxrQII9sWU4v6XWi8AdtC8"&gt;Nine years&lt;/a&gt; later, these children were also more willing and able to engage in emotive conversations with their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the effects of touch are more difficult to quantify. In the 1970s, for example, the psychiatrist Donald Winnicott &lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=yrALEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT6&amp;amp;ots=hsTdvMIPXQ&amp;amp;sig=0nD_mJfW0vtaQ_W7uuOpDEDIYHM&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how a mother’s touch helps infants and young children to experience the body as “the place where one securely lives”. This idea seems to be supported by ethnographic records and anthropological studies of communities where infants are in close contact with a caregiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in many communities – such as the Netsilik, !Kung, and Balinese – infants are pressed skin-to-skin with their mothers for much of the day. This means that infants are more likely to have their needs met quickly – being comforted when they cry or fed when they suckle – while also helping them develop a &lt;a href="https://www.opgs.org/_site/data/files/files/y12into13/88BABDC7E3A38681FA17DAEBEF0AF862.pdf"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; to touch. These forms of “&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10371397.2010.485552?casa_token=Bc5nII3hFIMAAAAA:NOBwp7nqnSLIEDnGDRKdNtrPF0CVxMJwVp_uXIR1fU4Awbny0Z0LWIxVV9hT_PHNiSVMwmT0MVvh"&gt;skinship&lt;/a&gt;” also help parents and their infants to develop deeper bonds through touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this research shows the benefits of touch in infancy, what about childhood? &lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=jsbGBAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PR5&amp;amp;dq=field+touch&amp;amp;ots=PXx6GygGcZ&amp;amp;sig=ublm4Cog1CeHMr4oP7AN80WiDok#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=field%20touch&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; of young children and adolescents have shown that touch – particularly caring touch like hugging from a parent or other caregivers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03004430.2010.497207?casa_token=UDEzqgZHStsAAAAA:xlh0dosQwbeBnGjT0Y8G0w_Dg-aYhwu1E_5hPhGnIqQ49nZl97JwP3REjLEvwcvHUqEkTylcRsf4GA"&gt;teachers&lt;/a&gt; – can support psychological development and wellbeing. For instance, touch can help children develop a sense of emotional security, belonging and feelings of support, especially in stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anthropologist Marjorie Goodwin has &lt;a href="https://campanthropology.org/2019/04/08/goodwin-and-cekaite-embodied-family-choreography/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; how “haptic rituals” – such as hugs between a parent and their child over the course of a day – can help the child feel loved and cared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly experiencing caring touch can also help children to develop their social &lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=LksrDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA73&amp;amp;dq=Goodwin+haptic+sociability&amp;amp;ots=NTpLcSku8f&amp;amp;sig=nmZpqkLK8hRddxMF5wLjWkrFlx4#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;interaction&lt;/a&gt; skills, including empathy toward others. Caring touch also reduces &lt;a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=7rWsQK9ek_EC&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA117&amp;amp;dq=aggressive+adolescents+massage+therapy&amp;amp;ots=mROdGFNv14&amp;amp;sig=rR8jI2ojojm445bgqA2py9EpFxg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=aggressive%20adolescents%20massage%20therapy&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;aggressive&lt;/a&gt; behaviour in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even today, many parents hold on to old fashioned ideas – popularised by psychologists like &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1928-02003-000"&gt;John Watson&lt;/a&gt; – that they should avoid caring touch with their children, out of fear that hugging or cuddling will cause their children to become weak willed. The scientific evidence doesn’t support such ideas, so go hug your kids.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/248260/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/248260/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

McCully, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School in the 1960s and ’70s whose colleagues banished him to the basement for insisting — correctly, it turned out — that homocysteine, an amino acid, was being overlooked as a possible risk factor for heart disease, died on Feb. 21 at his home in Winchester, Mass. He was 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;His daughter, Martha McCully, said the cause was metastatic prostate cancer. His death was not widely reported at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still a debated idea today, Dr. McCully’s theory — that inadequate intake of certain B vitamins causes high levels of homocysteine in the blood, hardening the arteries with plaque — challenged the cholesterol-focused paradigm backed by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. McCully didn’t think cholesterol should be ignored, but he thought it was malpractice to disregard the significance of homocysteine. His bosses at Harvard disagreed. First, they moved his lab below ground; then they told him to leave.

has long been considered the easiest way out, it's not always as peaceful as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Death during sleep could be from a variety of causes, including heart failure, sleep apnea, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-b45c1c30-066e-11f0-a41c-51a55c445061"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and respiratory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many of these conditions cause patients to slowly drift off, others may leave the person gasping for breath, clutching their chest, or choking in their final moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surprisingly, one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13891031/death-expert-doctors-preferred-die.html"&gt;most painless ways to go&lt;/a&gt; might also be one of the most brutal: some experts think imploding would happen so quick you wouldn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And do you remember how you felt as you drifted off under anesthesia the last time you had surgery? Probably not - but that's exactly the point. Overdosing on sedatives has also been touted as one of the more peaceful methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Implosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is the Titan submersible that imploded in 2023. Experts believe the passengers all died peacefully and had no idea what was going to happen &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's an unlikely cause of death, but experts believe a violent implosion would kill in milliseconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was believed to have been the case of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12223805/Debris-field-discovered-search-area-near-Titanic.html"&gt;five tragic passengers aboard the Titan submersible&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, which imploded during a deep-sea mission to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an implosion, an object collapses in on itself in just a matter of milliseconds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dale Molé, the former director of undersea medicine and radiation health for the US Navy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12224667/Exactly-happened-Titanic-fives-final-moments-revealed-former-Navy-doctor.html"&gt;told DailyMail.com at the time&lt;/a&gt; that an implosion 'is when the wave of pressure is inward, whereas an explosion is when the pressure wave or the shock wave goes out from whatever the source of that is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He compared an explosion to blowing up a balloon too much - the balloon will eventually pop when there is too much pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an implosion, the opposite occurs, when there is more outward pressure than the container can understand, then the insides collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Molé said the Titan passengers' deaths would have been quick and painless, dying almost instantly by the extraordinary forces exerted by the ocean at depth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It would have been so sudden, that they wouldn't even have known that there was a problem, or what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The USS Thresher, which imploded in 1963, is pictured above. The 129 sailors and civilians on board were believed to have died immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like being here one minute, and then the switch is turned off. You're alive one millisecond, and the next millisecond you're dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the Titan disaster, a similar catastrophe occurred in 1963 when the USS Thresher, a nuclear-powered submarine, most likely imploded when it exceeded 'test depth' and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8765875/Navy-releases-documents-Cold-War-loss-submarine.html"&gt;suffered a series of other failures&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 129 sailors and civilians on board were believed to have died immediately.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear how many Americans have died by implosion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Anesthesia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the odds dying while under anesthesia are low, it would be painless (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anesthesia is generally considered safe, helping nearly 40million Americans stay asleep during lifesaving operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in rare cases, the medicine can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Society of Anesthesiologists suggests anywhere from one in 100,000 to one in 200,000 patients die from anesthesia every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For healthy patients receiving routine procedures like colonoscopies and hip replacement, that risk is as low as one in 1million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this rate rises slightly from one in 100,000 for people with chronic health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anesthesia can cause the airway muscles to relax, which may block the airway and cause breathing issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may also result in low oxygen levels and excess carbon dioxide, which leads to brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low blood pressure and heart rate may also occur, which can cause heart attacks or strokes in patients with underlying conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in the rare instance of anesthesia-related death, the medicine would keep patients from feeling anything or being aware of the complications. This would make death painless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest usually kills in four to six minutes and is painless once patients fall unconscious (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the most common causes of deaths, killing 356,000 Americans every year. This is roughly 1,000 people every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12938535/Most-people-suffering-cardiac-arrest-home-dont-survive-data-suggests.html"&gt;nine in 10 don't survive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when heart activity stops without warning due to a disruption in the heart's natural rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is different from a heart attack, which is caused by a clogged artery blocking blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiac arrest kills in four to six minutes, while a heart attack can last several hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, light-headedness and weakness start suddenly and only occur for a few minutes before patients faint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once patients go unconscious, cardiac arrest is painless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-c60d8fd0-0660-11f0-a41c-51a55c445061"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates 60 percent of cardiac arrest patients are men, and a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.ohiohealth.com/men-face-greater-risk-of-cardiac-arrest-study/#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20tends%20to%20develop,the%20same%20age%2C%20researchers%20report."&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt; found that while one in nine men will suffer a cardiac arrest before age 70, only one in 30 women will have one.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart conditions like coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy - an enlarged heart - and heart valve disease can all increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest, as they increase the risk of rhythm problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Kidney disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hospice nurse Julie McFadden said once kidney failure patients stop dialysis, their decline only takes seven to 10 days (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Julie McFadden, a hospice nurse in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-1df74f20-2989-11ef-b2f9-157609981e08" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, called end-stage kidney disease one of the most 'peaceful' ways to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic kidney disease, also known as chronic kidney failure, occurs when another disease damages the organs and leaves them unable to properly filter out waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include diabetes, high blood pressure, urinary obstructions, and recurrent infections, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When kidney disease progresses, the best treatment is a kidney transplant, though many patients wait on a transplant list for years, often becoming too sick for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, patients undergo dialysis, which involves a machine removing waste from the blood when the kidneys can no longer do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this process can be time consuming and cause uncomfortable side effects like muscle cramps, low blood pressure, dizziness, and nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms McFadden said in recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ysgysc4eN4"&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span&gt;'End-stage kidney disease is a life-limiting chronic illness that is very hard to have because it's so long term.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'[It's] still difficult to have, but dying from end-stage kidney disease is definitely one of the most peaceful ways to die that I've seen.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;McFadden explained once patients stop dialysis, their decline typically only takes seven to 10 days.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During that time, it's unlikely they will be in any pain, as they will sleep the majority of the time due to lethargy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As toxins build up in the body after stopping dialysis, patients may experience itching, but 'they're so tired and sleeping all the time that they don't notice the itching,' McFadden said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She called end-stage kidney disease the closest thing to dying in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You slowly fall asleep until you die,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, about 58,000 Americans died from kidney disease, making it the ninth leading cause of death in the US.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across North America, deer and elk are increasingly suffering from a devastating illness. They stumble, drool, and appear visibly emaciated. They lose their fear of humans, staring blankly as if their senses have abandoned them. This grim affliction, known colloquially as “zombie deer disease,” has experts deeply concerned — not just for wildlife, but potentially for human health as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officially termed chronic wasting disease (CWD), the condition is neither a virus nor a bacterium. It’s but a prion disease; and if you’re not &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/prion-disease-02092015/"&gt;terrified of prions&lt;/a&gt;, you probably don’t know enough about them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-ticking-time-bomb"&gt;A ticking time bomb&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/health/diseases-and-conditions/prions-the-charismatic-proteins/"&gt;Prions are infectious proteins&lt;/a&gt; that cause the body’s normal proteins to misfold, leading to severe neurological damage and eventual death. Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), can affect both animals and humans. In humans, these diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which often appears spontaneously without a known cause, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which emerged during the “mad cow disease” epidemic when people consumed contaminated beef.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, prion diseases remain incurable and fatal. We have no idea how to fight back against them. Their unique biology poses enormous challenges for public health officials and scientists. This also makes it hard to assess the risk of them jumping to other species, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, since CWD is spreading, researchers are understandably worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First identified in captive mule deer in Colorado in 1967, CWD has silently spread among deer, elk, and moose populations across North America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, the disease may be reaching a dangerous critical point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What began quietly over half a century ago has now exploded into a full-blown wildlife epidemic. By early 2025, the disease had been documented in wild and domestic herds across 36 U.S. states and several Canadian provinces. This spread to faraway places like Finland, Norway, and Sweden, and even in farmed animals in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11852723/"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. In some places, infection rates among local deer populations are staggering. In southern Saskatchewan, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/chronic-wasting-disease-deer-bse-hunting-1.6270051"&gt;nearly 80%&lt;/a&gt; of male mule deer now carry CWD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why this disease is spreading&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first problem is that prions are remarkably durable. They’re not living entities, so they don’t really need to do anything to endure. Shed through bodily fluids — saliva, urine, feces — these prions persist in soils for years. They contaminate plants and &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="1947" href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/natural-sciences/physics-articles/matter-and-energy/the-real-color-of-water-blue/"&gt;water sources&lt;/a&gt;, creating invisible reservoirs of infection. Wildlife officials struggle to manage the disease, particularly as animals congregate at artificial feeding sites established by humans, which makes it easier to pass the disease from one animal to another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, where elk gather by the thousands at winter feedgrounds, warnings from scientists like conservationist Lloyd Dorsey have gone unheeded. “Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feeding,” he says. Now, experts fear, the situation has reached a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/20/chronic-wasting-disease-spread-zombie-deer-global-us-aoe"&gt;critical point&lt;/a&gt; and places like Wyoming have set up a perfect storm that can allow CWD to explode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As infected deer roam further and wider, hunters across the United States unknowingly harvest infected animals, consuming the contaminated venison and sharing it with their communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises hunters to test deer from infected areas, but compliance remains low. Simply put, hunters don’t seem to listen to the warnings. To make matters even worse, CDC “disease detectors” were among the first to be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/cdc-disease-detectors-fired-trump-administration-agency-cuts-doge-rcna192420"&gt;fired by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-humans-be-next"&gt;Could humans be next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No confirmed cases of humans contracting CWD have yet been documented, but it’s a looming threat. The more we let diseases like this roam free, the more we risk an unwanted jump to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, a chilling report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota warned of an impending global crisis if CWD were to spill over to humans. Authored by a panel of 67 leading scientists and health experts, the report concludes the United States — and indeed the world — is woefully unprepared for such an event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite this, no contingency plans exist at a national or international level to address the possibility of spillover, which would trigger a national and global crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report essentially piles on one bit of bad news after another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Currently, CWD management is in the domain of wildlife agencies. With no vaccine or treatment available, CWD management focuses on mitigating disease spread. Thus, CWD is likely to become endemic in more areas over time as the agent is introduced to new areas where cervids are present. Because cervids are widespread on every continent except Antarctica, CWD poses a significant global threat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.png"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source data-srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-750x564.png 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1140x857.png 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.webp 1176w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="" class="wp-image-280093 sp-no-webp perfmatters-lazy" alt="CWD prion protein structure" decoding="async" data-src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png" data-srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-750x564.png 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1140x857.png 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.png 1176w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1024x770.png 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-750x564.png 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9-1140x857.png 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PDB_6DU9.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-280093 sp-no-webp" alt="CWD prion protein structure" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;3D structure of major prion protein. Image via Wiki Commons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immediate concern is the disease jumping to a farm animal species. If that were to happen, we don’t even have a way to detect the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No single test can identify CWD transmission to a non-cervid species, clearly presenting a major diagnostic challenge. In theory, a combination of existing tests could be used, but data are not available on whether they could differentiate BSE or scrapie from CWD in&lt;br&gt;a novel animal host.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historical precedents for prion spillover do exist. In the 1980s and 1990s, the United Kingdom &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy"&gt;witnessed mad cow disease&lt;/a&gt; (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) jump to humans through contaminated beef, resulting in the fatal variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a risk of CWD spillover to other wildlife, non-cervid production animals, and humans. The risk of CWD spillover is not static and may be increasing as new strains emerge and exposure probabilities increase.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a pressing need to better understand evolving CWD prion strain characteristics and associated spillover risk,” the CIDRAP report concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-we-urgently-need-to-be-prepared"&gt;We urgently need to be prepared&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing some concerning human cases. Two hunters in Texas who frequently consumed deer meat from a CWD-infected region died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). And, while a direct link to CWD &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20240219-zombie-deer-disease-risks-for-humans"&gt;wasn’t proven&lt;/a&gt;, this is a plausible connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Physician recognition of prion diseases is limited because these illnesses are rare and have symptoms that overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases,” CIDRAP experts wrote. They recommend expanding surveillance programs, enhancing physician awareness, and establishing clear public health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amira Roess, an epidemiologist at George Mason University, underscores the importance of caution, &lt;a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2024-03/should-you-be-worried-about-zombie-deer"&gt;especially among hunters&lt;/a&gt;. “Fortunately, the risk of prion disease from deer appears low if humans limit their contact with deer, especially their blood and nervous tissue. But this means that we must be very careful and vigilant,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists agree there’s still a window of opportunity to prevent a human outbreak, but time is running short. Better coordination between wildlife management, public health agencies, and scientists is urgently needed. CIDRAP’s extensive report calls for immediate action: comprehensive surveillance, sustained research, and rigorous public outreach to educate hunters and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just two of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the 307 sick patients being unvaccinated or having an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are some 378 cases in the U.S. so far this year, according to a Friday update from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing the 285 measles cases recorded in the entirety of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, which has the second-highest number of measles cases in the country, Lea County is home to 40 of the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="42 confirmed measles cases"&gt;42 confirmed measles cases&lt;/a&gt;, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The spread of measles recently increased in Kansas, where the state’s &lt;a href="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://kshealthdata.kdhe.ks.gov/t/KDHE/views/InfectiousDiseaseCaseDashboard/DiseaseCharts?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" aria-label="health department"&gt;health department&lt;/a&gt; has reported 10 cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 211 measles cases located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (37), Dawson County (13), Yoakum County (12), Dallam County (6), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (8), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2). Measles cases not associated with the larger outbreak in West Texas include cases in Harris County (3), Lamar County (2), Midland County (1), Rockwall County (1) and Travis County (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 130 of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 102 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 58 were reported among adults aged 18 and above. The ages of 19 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="38 cases"&gt;38 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, 36 of which are in Lea County, an area on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Washington, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Vermont, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. Health officials from Oklahoma, which is not marked on the CDC’s measles tracker, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; four “probable” cases of measles as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus and can appear as late as 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces and linger in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after infected people leave a given area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Is The Isolation Protocol For Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles should isolate for four days after they develop a rash, with the day of rash onset being considered day zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        After software entrepreneur Marty Thomas survived Stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, he and wife MariKate started raising chickens for eggs—part of a move away from chemical- and pesticide-laden food. By 2023, that hobby had grown into a business that demanded more space, and they purchased a 74-acre property about 45 minutes south of Chicago. As Suzy Khimm writes for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bird-flu-kakadoodle-farm-eggs-rcna196879"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, Kakadoodle Farm is a relatively small operation, with 3,000 hens and seven part-time workers, some of whom alerted Marty in early January to a few dozen dead birds found in the coops. He attributed it to the single-digit temps and frozen water lines; a vet agreed. The telltale signs of bird flu—trouble breathing, nasal discharge, or depressed egg production—weren't present. Within two days, so many had died the vet notified the USDA.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Federal veterinarians were soon on the scene in hazmat suits and confirmed it was bird flu. By that point, a full week hadn't even passed—and yet only 500 hens were alive. The USDA returned and killed them all, leaving the body parts for the Thomases to clean up. Along with two farmworkers, they spent a full day burying the birds, their eggs, and feed on the farm's perimeter. The USDA will pay them $5 for each bird that was alive when it arrived, meaning $2,500. That's a sliver of the $100,000 in egg revenue they would have made through June, when the 120-day quarantine expires.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        At that point, they can bring chickens back to the farm, so long as they can get them. They hope to rebuild in an even more resilient way, like constructing coops in a way so that potentially-flu-carrying wild birds can't get to the feed. They've raised about $50,000 on GoFundMe from supportive customers, but "we're at the bottom of our barrel," says Marty. "If this doesn't work, we're out our entire life savings."

She had a tennis ball-sized tumor in her chest that her OB/GYN had brushed off as a benign cyst months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were other signs, in hindsight, that she and her doctor had missed, such as changes in the color and texture of her breasts, small lumps in her armpit and near her collarbone, intense abdominal pain, and nipple discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart said her symptoms also included 'extreme &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-c1730b00-065e-11f0-8539-952ebe8d4a1f"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; without trying, sleeping 13 hours a day, and never being able to recover from a common cold.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her last option, after all of the cancer drugs she tried failed, was Enhertu, a targeted chemotherapy drug that finds cancer cells, delivers medication directly to them, shrinks tumors, and minimizes harm to healthy tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14322495/cancer-vaccine-donald-trump-mrna-cure-tumors.html"&gt;experimental medicine&lt;/a&gt; has worked better than expected, getting rid of her pain, reducing the cancer that had spread to her lungs, reduced swelling of her liver, and signs of tumor growth have reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, feeling &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14322495/cancer-vaccine-donald-trump-mrna-cure-tumors.html"&gt;stronger than ever&lt;/a&gt; following her first year of treatment, she began making plans to travel with her eight-year-old son, including hiking through the jungles of Belize and Kauai.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those moments are when I feel most alive – being able to crawl through cave systems with him when just a couple of years ago I was told I had less than a year to live,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nicola Heart thought that nothing could be more difficult than holding her newborn babies as they died, but in 2020, at age 37, she faced an even greater challenge when she was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic breast cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Her symptoms included nipple discharge, a sudden change in breast size, a lump in her armpit, skin texture changes such as dimpling, unexplained extreme weight loss, sleeping 13 hours a day, and an inability to recover from a common cold&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I went from being put on hospice to where I am today – able to do most of the things I want to do and not be in pain.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around half of breast cancer patients are over 60, and the disease is generally one that is more likely to strike older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Heart is trying to disabuse women of that, noting that it is possible for a relatively young, healthy woman to be stricken by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘This is all new to me. It gets dark, not going to lie. But I keep reminding myself that I’m going to get through this, and things will start looking up soon.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart, from Dana Point, California, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of around 31 percent. The disease had already spread aggressively to her bones, liver, and lungs, causing excruciating pain and severe complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, her condition was so dire that she was advised to seek hospice care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I’ve been trying to navigate the fact that I have arrived at my last line of treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, her decline is slowing and her condition appears to be improving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has preserved her hair for years using Penguin Cold Caps, which reduce blood flow to the scalp, limiting chemotherapy exposure and protecting hair follicles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she has reached the very last medical option – new treatment Enhertu started three months ago – her pain has gone away, the metastases in her lungs have disappeared, her liver is shrinking again, and her tumor markers are coming down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Enhertu works like a targeted missile, finding cancer cells, delivering a powerful drug directly to them, and helping shrink tumors while minimizing damage to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart now feels able to spend more quality time with her son, something she struggled to do while she was undergoing a range of procedures, including a port placement, liver biopsy, and bone marrow biopsy, while also receiving countless blood transfusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, her blood counts were so low that she couldn't start her chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve been in and out of the hospital, dealing with transfusion fevers and unbearable pain,’ she said. ‘It’s been a whirlwind. I don’t even remember a lot of it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The last few weeks have been extremely tough – dealing with chemo side effects and cancer pain. On top of that, it looks like I will lose my hair. I’m pissed. Losing my hair this late in the game feels really shitty. I don’t want my son to remember me without hair,’ she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has maintained her hair for years using Penguin Cold Caps, a scalp-cooling process that temporarily decreases blood flow to that area, limiting the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach them, thereby protecting hair follicles from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now she faces the near-guaranteed prospect of losing her hair, likely for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Heart was exceedingly healthy before being stricken with cancer. She was in her 30s when she was diagnosed, a rarity given breast cancer generally strikes over women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After starting her last available treatment, Enhertu, three months ago, Nicola Heart's pain has disappeared, the metastases in her lungs are gone, her liver is shrinking again, and her tumor markers are decreasing, allowing her to spend more quality time with her son&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though Enhertu is highly targeted, the chemotherapy component is very strong and causes hair loss that even cold caps can't prevent. Cold caps are more effective with older chemotherapy drugs but more aggressive drugs like Enhertu can overcome the protective effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There are so many “cute wigs and short hairstyles” – but no, that’s not me. When I look in the mirror, I won’t recognize myself,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But since responding so positively to her last line of treatment, she is taking advantage of whatever time she has left.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started making plans to travel with my son, taking him hiking through the jungles of Belize and Kauai. Those moments are when I feel most alive – being able to crawl through cave systems with him when just a couple of years ago I was told I had less than a year to live,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lost twins in 2018 and is now unable to have more children due to cancer. She said her eight-year-old son is her greatest motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Heart said: ‘He loves sports, and I love watching him play. He keeps me going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve had to accept that I’m not in control of this disease. I live in the now.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:27:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPRGdGSzZrNGtJQm9IWVNxUjR1NWxwcWJNOVNJRDcyZlBSSmswd21YQThPLTVkVGNDUXBrYmpqMFlfbThRT3I3akZKc21TSlZzLTFrZzZ1c29oYmpyM2FOVXBFS21tUHhtSmE4bl9tbm5XZXRSSjhMcURPSDBnRVo1MzBjeUV4VUNBVTZQdG9IVXZoLTRXN1k3WEc0bTRLTHNoMVdKZmRLZHU1SkdYVGfSAbMBQVVfeXFMTlBLV3V2djg0OG5YeWw2X1g4ZHlhWU1nZ3M5ZVRxR1Ffc29NcEJmeVdPQ1dEQ0h5eG1PTklBc1dKX1AxWF9EYjFYX0RRVzNjaFZsMkk3VXVXQkdrZGVWRU5ZMmwyaUpXN2VCem5pdzNlaXozVVlsQWpoX05VSnlaSEx2NjBSNllZdjM0SUttVnE0RndteVowT1pVVFhoSDhxZGdGaEYxVUdIMnBKSjkxX3VmeEU</guid></item><item><title>Measles cases linked to outbreak in Texas reach 309, surpassing nationwide total in 2024 - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQcnJiY0RYZy1RaU51bWwtRllhaWZOQ0pEamdvZnNxY0RqeWpVM1FHeHVHVi1xR1R6UDR6NFo2dnhDcDJtQWVPUW9Db09qeUV5dlk5eGJEQ0NldkxfWS1RRXN1ZWpJN0tRWC0zaWpTNEQ4WnBHSy1Ub0dmaUwyZUVQZzAwNjg4ZW5kbUM2VEpoeThhaWg5ay1EbWQ1QWlvWHZGYUpqV2lkTTDSAa4BQVVfeXFMTVBlSGZVTHdPT1p3V0d4MGplSWZadzc4cU1CeXU5NDhiQjA4ajdMNzJzODVkNnNiN0ltS29peFE1ZHMwM3FUYkJxT3FxMlFUdE9WcmJiRFp5alFkd0RRZ1loWndqY29hbkdIWGFVWDZqSkFEVEtpajFwVWVjblB4aGFlRTRGYWhMb0JSLWR5RmdsY3JLMkd0TVJKRWF6Qm9LS184MTRMVHBobnFLbmh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The number of measles cases associated with an outbreak in western Texas has grown to 309, with 30 cases reported over the last three days, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This means the total number of Texas cases linked to the outbreak in roughly two months has surpassed the number confirmed for the entirety of last year in the U.S., which saw 285 cases nationwide, according to data from the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_1-measles-cases-in-2024" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Almost all of the cases are in unvaccinated individuals or in individuals whose vaccination status is unknown.

That's your vagus nerve at work. This essential nerve passes information between your brain, heart, and digestive system to support heart rate, digestion, and mood regulation, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22279-vagus-nerve?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49432227__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;"The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve in your body and is part of your parasympathetic nervous system, which is in charge of calming you down," says &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/12231/ashwini-nadkarni-psychiatry-boston-chestnut_hill?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49432227__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;Ashwini Nadkarni, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified psychiatrist at Mass General Brigham and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. "Activation of the vagal nerve slows down your heart rate, lowers your blood pressure, and inhibits your body's stress — or 'fight or flight' — response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;Given its influence on stress regulation, stimulating the vagus nerve has garnered attention as a potential tool to reduce stress, enhance mental clarity, improve sleep quality, and support overall well-being. And indeed, it's "associated with a greater ability to recover from stress and improved cognitive performance," says Dr. Nadkarni. "Vagal nerve stimulation can also play a critical role in good cardiovascular and digestive health, and even immune system regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;So how do you activate this powerful nerve? You can do it yourself with techniques like deep breathing, humming, and endurance activities like jogging, says Dr. Nadkarni. There are also surgically implantable vagus-nerve stimulation devices, which have been shown to be an effective treatment option for epilepsy, depression, and migraine, according to a May 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9093220/?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49432227__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="4"&gt;And now, devices like the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truvaga.com%2Fproduct%2Ftruvaga-plus%2F&amp;amp;xcust=___psv__p_49432227__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer sponsored"&gt;Truvaga Plus&lt;/a&gt; ($449, originally $499), a handheld vagus nerve stimulator, are gaining popularity for their potential to offer a convenient, nonsurgical approach to reaping the relaxation benefits of the vagus nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="5"&gt;The Truvaga Plus is the company's latest device, offering unlimited stimulation sessions and app-controlled functionality that allows you to adjust the device's intensity, set session reminders, and track your usage over time.

I incorporated one two-minute session into my nightly routine before bed for a week. While I didn't notice any effects for the first few nights, by midweek, I experienced noticeable physical relaxation before falling asleep. This relaxation calmed anxious, racing thoughts, which helped me &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Fall-Asleep-Right-Away-36597887"&gt;fall asleep more quickly&lt;/a&gt;, sleep uninterrupted throughout the night (a notable improvement from my usual one or two awakenings), and wake up more refreshed. This, in turn, improved my energy levels and focus and reduced stress during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="13"&gt;There's also research to support these calming effects: For instance, a September 2022 study in the journal &lt;a href="http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9599790/?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49432227__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;"Brain Sciences"&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/glimmers-how-to-find-them-49318726"&gt;vagus-nerve stimulation&lt;/a&gt; can affect neurotransmitters involved in your sleep-wake cycle to help regulate your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="14"&gt;Another significant advantage is the device's simplicity. After connecting the Truvaga Plus to its accompanying app, I was ready to begin my first session. First, I located my vagus nerve — instructions are provided, but it's generally near the pulse point on the side of your neck — applied the provided gel to the area, and placed the device's electrodes onto my skin. I then initiated the session in the app and adjusted the intensity until I felt a tingling sensation extending up my neck and into my face. The device beeped to let me know when my two minutes was up, and that was it. This straightforward setup made it a no-fuss addition to my nighttime routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="15"&gt;The device's convenience is also worth mentioning. Unlike more traditional methods that require specific conditions or extended time commitments, the Truvaga Plus's quick two-minute sessions fit seamlessly into my existing routine. Its compact size, comparable to a deck of cards, made it easy to use at home and while traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="16" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's Worth Noting About Truvaga Plus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="17"&gt;While non-invasive devices like the Truvaga Plus are generally considered safe, more research is needed to fully understand their long-term effects, says Dr. Nadkarni. That's why it's always best to check with your doctor before trying one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="18"&gt;There are also some people who should avoid using vagus-nerve stimulators altogether. If you have an underlying heart or lung condition like cardiac arrhythmia, &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/high-blood-pressure-49074127"&gt;high blood pressure,&lt;/a&gt; or sleep apnea, it's best to steer clear of these devices, says Dr. Nadkarni. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="19"&gt;There are also several personal considerations to keep in mind. Firstly, the device is priced at $499, which may be a significant investment. And like any wellness tool, individual experiences can vary. You might not notice any immediate benefits, and the effectiveness of the device can depend on how consistently you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="20" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who Is Truvaga Plus Best For?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="21"&gt;The Truvaga Plus is best suited for those seeking a holistic approach to stress management and overall wellness. If you find traditional vagus-nerve stimulation methods — like deep breathing, meditation, or cold exposure — challenging or time-consuming, you'll like the device's convenience and efficiency. And if, like me, you're specifically looking to &lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/how-to-sleep-better-49326892"&gt;sleep better&lt;/a&gt;, improve mental clarity, and reduce stress overall, the Truvaga Plus could be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="22"&gt;However, it's important to remember that while the device can be a valuable component of a wellness routine, it should not be viewed as a fix-all for underlying mood disorders, stress, or anxiety. Incorporating other healthy habits like regular exercise, a balanced diet, and mindfulness techniques is still essential for your overall well-being, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relievers/art-20047257?ref=popsugar.com&amp;amp;=___psv__p_49432227__t_w_" class="has-affiliate-link" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="23" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Truvaga Plus Worth the Splurge?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="24"&gt;There's no denying that the Truvaga Plus is an investment. But based on my improved sleep and energy levels, I'd certainly recommend it as a simple, portable, and effective part of a broader wellness routine, provided you use it regularly and have the financial means to make the purchase. Just remember that this device (or any one tool) is not a cure-all for stress, but rather one convenient component of a multifaceted approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="25"&gt;If you have a tighter budget, traditional techniques remain the most accessible and cost-effective ways to tap into the relaxation benefits of the vagus nerve. Ultimately, the decision to invest in the Truvaga Plus should be based on your personal preferences, finances, and health goals. But for me, it was 100 percent worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="26" data-element-has-ending-title="true"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="27"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popsugar.com/author/kathleen-ferraro"&gt;Kathleen Ferraro&lt;/a&gt; is a Minneapolis-based writer with a master's degree in journalism and nearly a decade of experience writing and editing.

"Fortified foods like omega-3-enriched eggs and certain dairy products can also provide some omega-3s in the diet," says Amy Goodson, a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in Dallas. Another beneficial omega-3 is known as alpha linolenic acid (ALA), which is found abundantly in canola and soybean oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;No matter which animal-based or plant-based options you consume, "we know it's preferable to increase omega-3 intake from foods rather than from supplements," says JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and the principal investigator of key omega-3s &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415637/" target="_blank"&gt;VITAL research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Why fish oil supplements are not all they’re cracked up to be &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Omega-3 properties are most powerful when they come directly from food—which offers a wider array of nutrients and more concentrated amounts of EPA, DHA, and ALA. There’s also a difference in the chemical structure of the fat in whole fish versus extracted fish oil, says Monti; and the manufacturing process can degrade the quality of nutrients in supplements and can even introduce worrisome contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An even more compelling reason to stick with food over omega-3 supplements? The purported cardiovascular benefits of fish oil supplements remain largely unproven in healthy people. "A lot of people became obsessed with fish oil about two decades back because there was initially some compelling data on improved heart health," says Freeman, "but this data has since been largely refuted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/dietary-supplements-health-facts" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i class=" "&gt;5 things you should know before trusting that supplement&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Indeed, much of this early research relied almost entirely on observational studies that were unable to prove causation. In subsequent randomized controlled trials—where causation can be measured—"supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids have shown no benefits," says Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Cleveland Clinic Heart, Vascular, and Thoracic Institute. Many &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33993205/" target="_blank"&gt;recent randomized trials&lt;/a&gt; have even tested fish oil pills against placebos and found no one more beneficial than the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This hasn't stopped over-the-counter fish oil supplement brands from touting purported heart-healthy benefits on their bottles though. "Over 20 years ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim for fish oil that it may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease—but we didn't have the trial data we now do," says Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She explains that the FDA stipulated at the time that its approval was based largely on observational studies and that randomized controlled trials were still needed. "Although subsequent large, well-conducted trials have since been done for omega-3 supplements and shown no benefit on cardiovascular events,” Navar says, “this outdated claim still hasn't been re-reviewed by the FDA.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An FDA spokesperson tells National Geographic that qualified health claims like this one means they were originally supported by scientific evidence but are not required to “meet the more rigorous ‘significant scientific agreement’ standard required for an &lt;i class=" "&gt;authorized&lt;/i&gt; health claim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To prevent consumers from being misled about the level of science supporting a claim, the FDA official notes that “a qualified health claim is accompanied by a disclaimer or other qualifying language that describes the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 15:18:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxObWhTNW9kRDVkbXZmTEVabXRHa29DRjFKSEo4VkZrNDI1ZEsxenBxNEZoZERsMWU1bmFBV0xKSUJGQUllUmZ3elQxVTJFcllBN0dsNnhfSFhsRjJqdEZMSnBSRGh3Y25LMlhQUl90NVA5cTRnTHA2ZUFXMUI5YU1QUk1qaUF4dw</guid></item><item><title>Tattoos Could Be a Hidden Cancer Risk, Study of Twins Finds - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNd2pyLUIwMkE2bmtPTHhHWElWSnFGRXhseHlpVVdJVzV4eXM4b2U0bWV1X3MxaU9Rb1pTNGVNRUhEbHZnNEhiemtSMkFXNjRrSUprTzJvODRFUm9YSXUtZ3dXM2JMYWtGVnZiOWRkX2xQRjFmVTdiN0FuV2x1TWtCdUItZXF0MmRZSUoyazNRS3dEVWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Your next tattoo might be riskier than currently assumed, recent research suggests. Scientists found evidence of a potential link between tattoo ink and a higher risk of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) conducted the study, published this January in BMC Public Health. They compared twins, finding that those who got tattoos had a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer and lymphoma. More research is needed to understand whether this connection is causal and the reasons behind it if so, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tattoos have become increasingly popular. According to a 2023 Pew survey, one-third of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/15/32-of-americans-have-a-tattoo-including-22-who-have-more-than-one/"&gt;currently sport a tat&lt;/a&gt;, with 22% having more than one. Given that, it’s important to know the potential long-term effects of tattoos, and the researchers say that not enough work has been done to understand whether tattoo ink could be carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, they analyzed data from the Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort (DTTC). The DTTC was created in 2021 by SDU scientists to survey twin pairs about their tattoo history, with volunteers solicited from the long-running Danish Twin Registry, also &lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/dtr"&gt;maintained&lt;/a&gt; at SDU. This allowed the researchers to know a person’s tattoo status and to track whether they later developed cancer. They specifically looked for cancer cases in parts of the body where particles of tattoo ink are known to deposit, such as the skin and lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All told, the researchers had information on nearly 6,000 adult twins, which they used to conduct two different types of studies that compared the cancer-related outcomes of tattooed and non-tattooed twins. In both designs, twins with tattoos were noticeably more likely to develop skin cancer and lymphoma than their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The exact added risk associated with tattooing differed depending on the type of cancer, the characteristics of the tattoo, and other relevant factors like age. But the largest associated risk was seen with tattoos larger than the size of a palm—people with these tattoos had a risk two to three times higher of these cancers than people without tattoos at all. That’s key, because it’s a possible sign of a dose-response effect, which would strengthen the case for there being a real association here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are concerned that tattoo ink interacting with surrounding cells may have severe consequences,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This sort of research alone can’t be used to confirm a cause-and-effect relationship between tattoos and cancer. But twin studies in general do allow scientists to avoid many of the limitations of similar research (because twins are so genetically and often environmentally alike, there’s less noise in the data to worry about). There have also been at least four other studies in recent years examining this issue. Three of these &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00228-1/fulltext"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, two of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.70260"&gt;which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/2020/05000/cosmetic_tattooing_and_early_onset_basal_cell.20.aspx"&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; at U.S. residents, have suggested a possible link, while one &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/29/10/2093/124436/Tattoos-and-Hematologic-Malignancies-in-British?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find any relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there could still be other explanations. People who get tattoos may be more likely to engage in other cancer-linked behaviors like smoking and drinking. So having a tattoo may simply be an indirect marker of increased cancer risk generally, not a cause of it. Tattoos might also lessen the chances of someone noticing their skin cancer early,, which could then lead to worse outcomes (in this scenario, tattoos wouldn’t be causing cancers, but would be making them more dangerous).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another lingering question, assuming this connection is genuine, is exactly what’s behind it. It’s possible that tattoo ink can agitate our body’s cells in a particular way, causing inflammation or other changes that could fuel cancer formation. Some research has also found that ingredients found in certain ink colors, such as black or red, are more harmful or allergy-inducing than others. The researchers didn’t find clear evidence of a color effect in their study but aren’t yet discounting that it could be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In any case, the team says that more research is needed to get to the bottom of this potential issue. “Studies that pinpoint the etiological pathway of tattoo ink-induced carcinogenesis are recommended,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People hoping to build muscle with the support of a creatine supplement might be disappointed by new research which shows it has little to no effect when taken at the recommended level.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;People who take the popular sports supplement &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/creatine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; and lift weights do not build &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/muscle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; any faster than those who do &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/resistance+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; without the supplement, new research shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UNSW-led clinical trial that put 54 people through a 12-week resistance training program found no difference between those who took the supplement at the recommended dose and those who did not, the research &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups in the randomized control trial put on an average of two kilograms of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lean+body+mass/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lean body mass&lt;/a&gt; during the program, which involved three supervised resistance training sessions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've shown that taking five grams of creatine supplement per day does not make any difference to the amount of lean muscle mass people put on while resistance training," said senior author Dr. Mandy Hagstrom, from UNSW's School of Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The benefits of creatine may have been overestimated in the past, due to methodological problems with previous studies," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a naturally occurring compound which supplies energy to muscles. It is produced by the liver, pancreas and kidneys, and found in protein-rich foods. Previous research shows creatine supplements help build muscles, enhance athletic performance, and may even have cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, previous trials have started supplementation and exercise programs on the same day, making it difficult to separate the effect of each on muscle gains, Dr. Hagstrom said. They've also overlooked the potential for creatine to cause &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/water+retention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;water retention&lt;/a&gt;, though more research was needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in this trial, those in the supplement group started on creatine one week before the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/exercise+program/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;exercise program&lt;/a&gt; began, taking five grams per day, which is at the upper end of the recommended maintenance dose of three to five grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We had what we call a wash-in phase, where half of the participants started taking the supplement, without changing anything else in their daily life, to give their body a chance to stabilize in terms of its response to the supplement," Dr. Hagstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The effect of creatine with and without resistance training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that first week, people taking creatine gained more lean body mass, particularly women, gaining an average of 0.5 kilograms more than the control group. However, the extra gains they made varied greatly, and soon dropped back to match those of the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The people taking the creatine supplement saw changes before they even started exercising, which leads us to believe that it wasn't actual real muscle growth, but potentially fluid retention," Dr. Hagstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then once they started exercising, they saw no additional benefit from creatine, which suggests that 5 grams per day is not enough if you're taking it for the purposes of building muscle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, previous trials with no wash-in period found those on creatine gained 1 kilogram more muscle, than those not taking the supplement, during trials spanning four to 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In theory then you would have expected our creatine group to put on three kilograms of muscle over the 12-week program, but they didn't," said first author Dr. Imtiaz Desai, from UNSW's School of Health Sciences and Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants, aged 18 to 50, were all relatively healthy people doing less than the recommended minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were put through the same training program and had their measurements taken at multiple stages using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a non-invasive imaging technique that measures bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition. They were also required to keep a food log three days prior to each assessment, which showed no significant differences in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those on creatine did bypass a loading phase, which includes taking 20 to 25 grams daily for up to one week. While it is common to start with a loading phase, it can cause gastrointestinal issues and is not necessary to reach saturation levels—the maximum that the body can store at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;More research needed on creatine doses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial suggests people need to take more creatine than is commonly thought to get the desired benefit of additional muscle gains, the experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just how much more will need to be the subject of further research, but 10 grams could be the dose to test first, given it's already shown to be safe and promising for both brain and bone health, Dr. Hagstrom said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longer study would also be beneficial, added Dr. Desai, as would measuring body water content, tracking the menstrual cycle—which can affect fluid retention—and creatine absorption, which was not feasible for this trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It would be really interesting to see if creatine has more of a long-term benefit," said Dr. Desai. "When you start weight training, you have those beginner gains in strength and those start tapering off around the 12-week mark and become slower, so it's possible the support from creatine might come at a later stage."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the researchers hope it will give people more realistic expectations on creatine use, and prompt them to question claims made in the marketing of some supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For your average person taking creatine to boost their gains in the gym, this will hopefully change their perception about what it can help them achieve," Dr. Desai said. "For &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/professional+athletes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;professional athletes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those who must be at a particular weight for their sport, the findings may inform how and when they take the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/supplement/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for researchers, it's hoped the study may encourage others to start to use a wash-in phase, to better understand the impact of supplements with and without exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, researchers across several fields, including &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lgbtq-rights/t-17455109"&gt;LGBTQ+&lt;/a&gt; health and gender identity, climate and environment, and medical research disciplines have had &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/us-science-funding-freeze-a-threat-to-academic-freedom/a-71501071"&gt;research financing taken away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, research on vaccine hesitancy suffered this fate. More than 30 grants for researching public mistrust of immunizations have been terminated, according to several US media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these cuts, the role of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vocal vaccine skeptic — looms large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Trump wields budget ax against US science, medical research" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Trump wields budget ax against US science, medical research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-71924042" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="71924042" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/71865331_605.webp" data-duration="02:55"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250314_QScience12E_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20250314_QScience12E_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/" title="External link — According to KFF Health News"&gt;According to KFF Health News&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, acting National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Matthew Memoli requested details on "grants, contracts or collaborations" on mRNA vaccine research be provided to Kennedy and the White House. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar requests reportedly preceded the administration's decision to scrap support for vaccine hesitancy research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers speaking on condition of anonymity also told US media that NIH officials advised them to remove mRNA references from their grant applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a stop to mRNA research would have far-reaching consequences since the technology is at the forefront of current medical developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;mRNA, the basis for two COVID vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mRNA technology's biggest claim to fame is as the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/katalin-kariko-and-drew-weissman-win-nobel-prize-in-medicine/a-66978845"&gt;basis for the COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; created by BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna within a year of the coronavirus pandemic. The researchers behind the technology &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/katalin-kariko-and-drew-weissman-win-nobel-prize-in-medicine/a-66978845"&gt;were also awarded a Nobel Prize in Medicine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using an inactivated version of the virus as with many other vaccines — and AstraZeneca's first-released COVID jab — the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/coronavirus-vaccine/t-55769446"&gt;BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna shots&lt;/a&gt; contained mRNA, or messenger RNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mRNA is a genetic molecule occurring in multicellular organisms, including plants, animals and fungi. It acts as a genetic script — giving a template for the body to produce proteins that perform specific and essential functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID vaccines containing an mRNA script prompt the body's cells to produce proteins identical to the spike proteins on the outer shell of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/coronavirus-latest/t-52104885"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. It means the vaccinated person’s &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/immune-system/t-66950642"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; has a target to identify and immediately attack the pathogen in the event of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vaccines were highly effective in protecting against severe symptoms and likely saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims by conspiracy theorists that the shots altered the DNA of recipients made many people distrustful of the vaccines. This fear is unfounded, since mRNA vaccines don’t enter the nucleus of cells, where our primary genetic information is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malaria mRNA vaccines now in development limbo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/malaria/t-67585233"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; vaccine currently in wide use ― known as "RTS,S" or "Mosquirix" ― is not an mRNA shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But mRNA-based malaria vaccines are in development. They could help fight the mosquito-borne disease that kills roughly 600,000 people every year, between two-thirds and three-quarters of whom are children under five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.doherty.edu.au/news-events/news/mrna-technology-to-develop-powerful-malaria-vaccine" title="External link — research team from New Zealand and Australia revealed they had developed an mRNA shot"&gt;research team from New Zealand and Australia revealed they had developed an mRNA shot&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was successful in animal models. The vaccine stimulates immune cells in the liver, where the malaria-causing Plasmodium parasite travels after it enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a big leap, of course, from animal models to human medical trials, and then to a vaccine. The process can take years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, experts believe mRNA vaccines are particularly suited to tackle malaria because they can be adjusted quickly in case of mutations in the disease. That's also a plus for the mRNA flu vaccines currently in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German pharmaceutical company BioNTech was running phase one and two trials of its own mRNA malaria vaccine, meaning the shot was tested on humans. But as of March 5, 2025, this was &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/fda-puts-clinical-hold-on-biontechs-malaria-vaccine-trial/" title="External link — halted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US"&gt;halted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where the trials were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BioNTech was requested to make changes and is working with the FDA to address those requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An mRNA cancer vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mRNA vaccines are also being explored for several other diseases, including hard-to-treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; has a high mortality rate ― nine in ten patients don't survive. But researchers in the US are working on a vaccine that would keep the cancer from returning once the initial tumor has been surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent phase one clinical trial showed that, in some patients, the vaccine activated tumor-specific immune cells that remained in the body up to nearly four years after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/a-vaccine-for-pancreatic-cancer/a-65705453"&gt;pancreatic cancer vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which is being developed cooperatively by BioNTech and US company Genentech, had to be personalized for each trial participant. It causes the body's cells to produce neoantigens, a specific protein found only on that patient's tumor. This trains the immune system to recognize cancer cells as something foreign that need to be fought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shot is still in development; &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" title="External link — results from the trial were published in the journal Nature"&gt;results from the trial were published in the journal Nature&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US were to put a halt to all federal funding for mRNA research, it's unclear to what extent developments like those of cancer or malaria vaccines would continue.&lt;/p&gt;

By the half-year mark he had lost almost half his body weight, dropping from 300lbs to 157lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the South Carolinian landed a role in a commercial advertising the drugs for his employer at the time, the telehealth giant LifeMD.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the ad he explained how his father's death had led him to 'fill the void with food.'  Modeling a new svelte look, he told viewers: 'I had made up my mind, I was done embarrassing myself. For the first time in five years, I feel confident, I feel the difference.

Weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy have been linked to a rare eye condition that can cause vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts and his wife Stacey are suing Dr Tony Puopolo, who prescribed him the weight &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14507013/Pharmacist-warns-rise-painful-digestive-disease-jabs-Mounjaro.html"&gt;loss drugs via LifeMD, for medical malpractice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being resigned to being obese, Brad Roberts couldn't believe it when he lost 24lbs in a month on weight loss drugs. However, in a shocking turn of events, the 44-year-old father-of-four and his wife Stacey are suing the doctor who prescribed him the weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family, who are seeking damages of $35.8 million, claim in court records that during November 2022 and 2023 the doctor over-prescribed a combination of 'overlapping', and sometimes unapproved, drugs to speed up his weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point the complaint reveals that Roberts, a former high-flying chief operating officer, was losing up to 3.5lbs a week, which exceeds the recommended weight loss rates of around 1 to 2lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brent Wilkerson, who has treated Roberts since 2023 for his hearing issues, adds in the suit that because the fat surrounding his ear tubes shrank so fast, he is no longer able to hear property and 'everything sounds muffled as if he were underwater, all while constantly experiencing tinnitus (ringing in the ears)'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his assessment of Roberts' condition, he continues in court documents: 'Loud noises make the tinnitus worse, causing severe piercing pain, pressure and migraine headaches. He wears wool caps over his ears in an attempt to muffle loud sounds.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden and rapid weight-loss can cause the fatty tissue surrounding the Eustachian tubes, which connect your ears to the back of your throat, to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause the tubes to stay open when they should be shut, and ultimately result in hearing issues that are rarely but increasingly being reported by those on Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts has undergone at least six surgeries to try and remedy his hearing problems but he says with no success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another one of the court documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Dr Yadira Lockard, a psychologist who has served as Roberts' therapist since January 2015, describes his deterioration after he was allegedly 'dangerously' overmedicated with weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Off the back of his transformation Roberts landed a role in a commercial advertising the drugs for his employer at the time, the telehealth giant LifeMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roberts and his wife Stacey are suing Dr Tony Puopolo, who prescribed him the weight loss drugs via LifeMD, for medical malpractice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She states: 'Roberts does not have the mental capacity to make life decision of any particular consequence to himself or on behalf of his family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lockard says in the suit she noticed a rapid decline with Roberts around December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, she says that she treated him regularly for mental health matters and 'issues in the ordinary course including generalized anxiety' and nothing led her to question his 'capacity to make financial or personal decisions'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was an active and involved father and husband,' she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, around December 2023, a year into his weight loss, Dr Lockard claims in the suit she started noticing a concerning change in Roberts' behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-bf7c2f60-0371-11f0-bf40-edd94db96d4c" class=""&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;: 'Roberts began to complain to me that his medical ailments had impacted his ability to function normally and had rendered it impossible for him to follow and / or understand his email correspondence, transmit email correspondence, read and understand correspondence that he received and focus and / or concentrate on any communication (whether oral or written).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts allegedly complained, according to the suit, that he could not bank, drive more than a few minutes at a time or engage in intimate acts with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based Dr Robert Cooper, who has specialized in diabetes for more than 25 years, warns that the overuse of GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic can have devastating consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of the affidavits, he notes: &lt;span&gt;'If GLP-1s are sufficiently overprescribed, whether it is in the same medication or the same class of medication, it will result in adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, biliary pathology, hypoglycemia, and even death.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As noted by Dr Wilkerson, Roberts' therapist Dr Lockard says in her statement that she also found Roberts 'complained (and continues to complain) of excruciating pain in both ears'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on some of the other complaints he relayed to her during therapy sessions, Dr Lockard reveals: 'His teeth are constantly in pain and feel soft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At one point he said he was losing up to 3.5lbs a week on weight loss drugs, which exceeds the recommended weight loss of around 1 to 2lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The roof of his mouth is almost constantly burning, but at other times his whole mouth feels ice cold. His tongue feels swollen and he cannot eat anything that is firm. He relies on soft foods and protein shakes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there is not much research around the effect of weight loss medications on oral health Dr Fatima Khan, a dentist and co-founder of Riven Oral Care in Maryland, says that some of the things she has heard of include acidic tastes in the mouth, enamel erosion, sensitive teeth and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because some weight loss drugs, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy, can cause acid reflux or heartburn as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with his physical health being impacted, Dr Lockard says in the suit that Roberts is also suffering from neurocognitive deficits with 'holes in his memory that never previously existed' and 'limited short-term memories'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms Dr Lockard says she has observed include tremors, slurred speech, brain fog, and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes in one of the court documents: 'Regrettably, none of the ailments described have abated and, in my professional opinion, have grown worse and appear unlikely to abate in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roberts alleges in the suit that his weight loss medications were prescribed after a video consultation with Dr Puopolo via LifeMD and no follow-up appointments were scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also claims he was not warned about the potential side effects or of other treatments available.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based Dr Robert Cooper, who has specialized in diabetes for more than 25 years, says in the suit that from the evidence he has seen, that he believes Dr Puopolo was negligent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concludes: 'If GLP-1s are sufficiently overprescribed, whether it is in the same medication or the same class of medication, it will result in adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, pancreatitis, biliary pathology, hypoglycemia, and even death.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No trial date has been set to resolve the case. In response to the allegations against Dr Puopolo, who was working through the platform LifeMD at the time, a spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'As we have explained in our court filings, the allegations in the case are meritless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have already made a motion to the court to have the case dismissed as a matter of law, and we look forward to the court's decision on that motion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally developed to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-a55ab3d0-034f-11f0-bf40-edd94db96d4c" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by lowering blood sugar levels. Diabetes can be genetic – known as type 1 diabetes, but around three quarters of the 38.4 million cases in the US are type 2 and caused by poor diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After studies revealed that the drug, which falls into the category of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist (GLP-1s) injections, was a highly effective appetite-suppressant, the weekly injections were repurposed to treat weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, 92 percent of new Ozempic users had been diagnosed with diabetes. By 2021, this had fallen to 77 percent and continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some experts said there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and claim the incidents are very rare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests patients taking Ozempic, which contains an active ingredient called semaglutide, can lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking another GLP-1 drug called Mounjaro lose as much as a fifth of their body weight over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around a fifth of people who take weight-loss injections suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For most, these issues fade after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of greater concern are reports of pancreatitis. This causes inflammation of the pancreas, an organ in the abdomen which produces digestive hormones. In some cases, pancreatitis can be life-threatening and trigger organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study carried out by researchers at Harvard University last year concluded that taking Ozempic doubles the risk of a rare condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This medical emergency occurs when blood flow to the nerves of the eye becomes blocked, causing vision loss. But despite the increased risk, the condition is still thought to only occur in one in every 4,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are not any official warnings about hearing problems associated with Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But like Robers, patients in online support groups are increasingly raising the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has reached out to Novo Nordisk (the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy) and Eli Lilly and Company (the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound) for comment on Roberts' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Treatment shows potential to slow the progression of human degenerative eye diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have developed eye drops that extend vision in animal models of a group of inherited diseases that lead to progressive vision loss in humans, known as retinitis pigmentosa. The eye drops contain a small fragment derived from a protein made by the body and found in the eye, known as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF).  PEDF helps preserve cells in the eye’s retina. A report on the study is published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While not a cure, this study shows that PEDF-based eye drops can slow progression of a variety of degenerative retinal diseases in animals, including various types of retinitis pigmentosa and dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD),” said Patricia Becerra, Ph.D., chief of NIH’s &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/research/research-labs-and-branches/protein-structure-and-function"&gt;Section on Protein Structure and Function&lt;/a&gt; at the National Eye Institute and senior author of the study. “Given these results, we’re excited to begin trials of these eye drops in people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All degenerative retinal diseases have cellular stress in common. While the source of the stress may vary—dozens of mutations and gene variants have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa, AMD, and other disorders—high levels of cellular stress cause retinal cells to gradually lose function and die. Progressive loss of photoreceptor cells leads to vision loss and eventually blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous research from Becerra’s lab revealed that, in a mouse model, the natural &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/news-and-events/news/nih-study-finds-loss-youth-protein-may-drive-aging-eye"&gt;protein PEDF can help retinal cells stave off the effects of cellular stress&lt;/a&gt;. However, the full PEDF protein is too large to pass through the outer eye tissues to reach the retina, and the complete protein has multiple functions in retinal tissue, making it impractical as a treatment. To optimize the molecule’s ability to preserve retinal cells and to help the molecule reach the back of the eye, Becerra developed a &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/news-and-events/news/scientists-unravel-function-sight-saving-growth-factor"&gt;series of short peptides derived from a region of PEDF&lt;/a&gt; that supports cell viability. These small peptides can move through eye tissues to bind with PEDF receptor proteins on the surface of the retina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new study, led by first author Alexandra Bernardo-Colón, Becerra’s team created two eye drop formulations, each containing a short peptide. The first peptide candidate, called “17-mer,” contains 17 amino acids found in the active region of PEDF. A second peptide, H105A, is similar but binds more strongly to the PEDF receptor. Peptides applied to mice as drops on the eye’s surface were found in high concentration in the retina within 60 minutes, slowly decreasing over the next 24 to 48 hours. Neither peptide caused toxicity or other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When administered once daily to young mice with retinitis pigmentosa-like disease, H105A slowed photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss. To test the drops, the investigators used specially bred mice that lose their photoreceptors shortly after birth. Once cell loss begins, the majority of photoreceptors die in a week. When given peptide eye drops through that one-week period, mice retained up to 75% of photoreceptors and continued to have strong retinal responses to light, while those given a placebo had few remaining photoreceptors and little functional vision at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we show that eye drops containing these short peptides can pass into the eye and have a therapeutic effect on the retina,” said Bernardo-Colón. “Animals given the H105A peptide have dramatically healthier-looking retinas, with no negative side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of gene-specific therapies are under development for many types of retinitis pigmentosa, which generally start in childhood and progress over many years. These PEDF-derived peptide eye drops could play a crucial role in preserving cells while waiting for these gene therapies to become clinically available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test whether photoreceptors preserved through the eye drop treatment are healthy enough for gene therapy to work, collaborators Valeria Marigo, Ph.D. and Andrea Bighinati, Ph.D., University of Modena, Italy, treated mice with gene therapy at the end of the week-long eye drop regimen. The gene therapy successfully preserved vision for at least an additional six months.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see whether the eye drops could work in humans – without actually testing in humans directly – the researchers worked with Natalia Vergara, Ph.D., University of Colorado Anschutz, Aurora, to test the peptides in a human retinal tissue model of retinal degeneration. Grown in a dish from human cells, the retina-like tissues were exposed to chemicals that induced high levels of cellular stress. Without the peptides, the cells of the tissue model died quickly, but with the peptides, the retinal tissues remained viable. These human tissue data provide a key first step supporting human trials of the eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the NEI Intramural Research Program. Additional funding was provided by the Prevention of Blindness Society, Fondazione Telethon, HEAL-ITALIA Foundation, CellSight Development Fund, and Research to Prevent Blindness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Being 'tired all the time' for at least a few weeks, and experiencing extreme fatigue after gentle exercise are red flag signs, doctors have warned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Milli Raizada, an NHS GP specialising in hormone health, has said Britons should seek medical help if they show signs of persistent fatigue &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Prolonged, unrelenting fatigue lasting more than six months meets the diagnostic criteria for CFS/ME, but even tiredness that persists for a few weeks should not be ignored,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/normal-tiredness-vs-chronic-fatigue_uk_67dab1c3e4b0e3967487d872"&gt;Huff Post UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Early assessment and blood tests can help identify or rule out potential causes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of the condition — which blights comedian Miranda Hart — can include cognitive difficulties such as memory problems and poor concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Muscle or joint pain, unexplained headaches, dizziness or heart palpitations’ may also accompany the exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same goes for ‘frequent sore throats or swollen glands, suggesting immune dysfunction,’ Dr Raizada added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome, but doctors can try a series of medications to target symptoms, including antidepressants, as well as physiotherapy and counselling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-81d4d040-0655-11f0-8f67-9de523b21592" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says energy management can be one of the most effective treatments - offering guidance on how to get the most out of your available energy without worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, comic and actor Miranda Hart recounted her three-decade battle with chronic fatigue syndrome that 'left her bedbound and without joy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Comic Miranda Hart has come under fire for suggesting she had found a cure to her chronic fatigue syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In her autobiography the 51-year-old — best known for her BBC sitcom Miranda — recounted her three-decade long health battle that initially saw her diagnosed with agoraphobia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially diagnosed with agoraphobia, the 51 year-old later learned that undiagnosed Lyme disease had developed into chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her memoir Miranda said she struggled to deal with the 'unnerving neurological symptoms' she first experienced when she was 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that it got 'considerably worse' when she headed into her 40s along with increasing fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling when she received her diagnosis she also said: 'I got off that Zoom call, pulled my laptop shut and sat there, still and aghast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So many emotions, I was shocked, but I also immediately felt a deep well of sadness and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For over three decades I'd KNOWN there was something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recalled all the times I'd told different doctors, 'I feel toxic and poisoned, or, It's like I have flu every day but I don't have a temperature'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'(It's amazing how the body can sometimes literally tell us what's going on.) I felt anger rising at the times l'd been told I must have agoraphobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would try and treat it as such, when, as it turned out, it was the lack of energy and the extreme light and sound sensitivity that made my body crash when going out to be in any kind of activity or stimulating environment.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 14:01:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPLUszdmtMRURUaGREMjREaDFoeWdmV3hidFhfM3JpMmtVY09kMXVYVEp0cUw2bndOeDI4QWVVSnFZeXFURkoySEgxWkM0TGhDN05palVPWjQ0Y19jd051S2lxV1NzUzFnYnA2V1pTdXRlQXotV2h1OThuVkdrMVlCRHV1OUZtZWV2dTIzdkNNd0treEo2dnFvLXY3SjVIZ3NWbUHSAacBQVVfeXFMTXNETHpaS2NLWDV1MmFwekJJVHpfd2NJcS1OYkl4VDRkTFRITWxEZG9qSEM3aFR5c1NkRUtjVUtTTjdHSVdwRXpwTW5vSTF4NENaSFVoZHdaRTZTUFJYNFVOZHhfc2VCUGdiTlFjTjdJTlkyNFFfVUhNZU1HQkc0azJFdWhhbno3ZW1lemdaNnhna3p2WnZ5VUpTSHRNOThKYnI2TnVrNWM</guid></item><item><title>How the language of job postings can attract rule-bending narcissists - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOcmQ0dFpQel81elpvSjVaZ21yY1BfQjRGeWJ3czkwZlNSUkhWckR2YThJN2lFT25fQmZTaGl1TjZFbXVGLTU1Mm8xeks3UWNJQV9sQUs5bTdma3k5N0FJWjRiYVY1TnQ2SzhNVmM1dWx3LXNjYnFrYm9rV2lhRVVGVU01UVFudWx2bEg1cGFUVXdEbXZ4eXlSQnduYm1SUmdBQmRjM1NlV2ZCMEFJd09F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies write job postings carefully in hopes of attracting the ideal candidate. However, they may unknowingly attract &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-021-04761-z"&gt;and select&lt;/a&gt; narcissistic candidates whose goals and ethics might not align with a company’s values or long-term success. Research shows that narcissistic employees are more likely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2308/accr-51276"&gt;to behave unethically&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-012-1528-7"&gt;legal consequences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While narcissistic traits can lead to negative outcomes, we aren’t saying that companies should avoid attracting narcissistic applicants altogether. Consider a company hiring a salesperson. A firm can benefit from a salesperson who is persuasive, who “thinks outside the box,” and who is “results-oriented.” In contrast, a company hiring an accountant or compliance officer would likely benefit from someone who “thinks methodically” and “communicates in a straightforward and accurate manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bending the rules is of particular concern in accounting. A significant amount of research examines how accounting managers sometimes bend rules or massage the numbers to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacceco.2005.01.002"&gt;achieve earnings targets&lt;/a&gt;. This “earnings management” can misrepresent the company’s true financial position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, my co-author &lt;a href="https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/nick-seybert"&gt;Nick Seybert&lt;/a&gt; is currently &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5135440"&gt;working on a paper&lt;/a&gt; whose data suggests rule-bender language in accounting job postings predicts rule-bending in financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current findings shed light on the importance of carefully crafting job posting language. Recruiting professionals may instinctively use rule-bender language to try to attract someone who seems like a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1996.tb01790.x"&gt;good fit&lt;/a&gt;. If companies are concerned about hiring narcissists, they may want to clearly communicate their ethical values and needs while crafting a job posting, or avoid rule-bender language entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What still isn’t known&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we find that professional recruiters are using language that attracts narcissists, it is unclear whether this is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we are unsure what really drives rule-bending in a company. Rule-bending could happen due to attracting and hiring more narcissistic candidates, or it could be because of a company’s culture—or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Two measles exposures were reported at Reagan National Airport and on the Yellow Line last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposures were possible on the airport’s terminal shuttle bus between noon and 2:30 p.m., the Virginia Department of Health announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/03/20/virginia-health-officials-investigating-additional-potential-measles-exposures-in-northern-virginia/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. They were also possible between 12:15 and 3:15 p.m. on the Yellow Line train from the airport, transferring at the L’Enfant Plaza station to the Silver Line train heading toward Downtown Largo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VDH spokesperson clarified that the exposures only happened on transit, not inside DCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another measles exposure was also reported at Dulles International Airport on March 5. This is in addition to a previous March 5 exposure reported &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/12972-2/"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both people are Maryland residents who recently traveled together internationally,” the VHD said. “Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the second and third reported instances of measles traveling through Northern Virginia this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health offers the following advice to anyone who may have been exposed to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who was exposed and considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for symptoms for 21 days from the date of your potential exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away. &lt;strong&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve the highest level of protection, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete press release is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND, Va. – The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) was notified of &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx"&gt;two additional confirmed cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; that traveled through Northern Virginia Wednesday, March 5 and Friday, March 14. Both people are Maryland residents who recently traveled together internationally. Health officials are coordinating an effort to identify people who might have been exposed, including contacting potentially exposed passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listed below are the dates, times, and locations of the potential exposure sites in Virginia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dulles International Airport (IAD) on Wednesday, March 5:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concourse A, on transportation to the International Arrivals Building (IAB) and in the baggage claim area between 8 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concourse A, on transportation to the main terminal and in the baggage claim area between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. (&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/12972-2/"&gt;Previously reported&lt;/a&gt; March 9 and unrelated to this new exposure.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) on Friday, March 14:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal Shuttle Bus between 12 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington Area Metro on Friday, March 14:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yellow Line Train from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station transferring at the L’Enfant Plaza station to the Silver Line Train heading towards the Downtown Largo station between 12:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any additional exposure sites identified in Virginia will be posted to the &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/"&gt;VDH Measles website&lt;/a&gt;. Additional exposure sites have been identified in &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Two-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-Maryland-residents-with-recent-international-travel.aspx"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia has not had any reported cases of measles in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if you were at the above locations on the day and time specified?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have never received a measles containing vaccine (either the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine or a measles-only vaccine which is available in other countries), you may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;strong&gt; Anyone who was exposed and considered to be at risk of developing measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch for symptoms for 21 days from the date of your potential exposure.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you notice symptoms of measles, immediately isolate yourself by staying home.&lt;/strong&gt; Contact your healthcare provider right away. &lt;strong&gt;Call ahead before going to your healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room &lt;/strong&gt;to notify them that you may have been exposed to measles and ask them to call the local health department. This call will help protect other patients and staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone with an immunocompromising condition should consult with their healthcare provider if they have questions or develop symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures is very low. However, to achieve the highest level of protection, contact your healthcare provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms usually appear in two stages. In the first stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough. These symptoms usually start seven to fourteen days after being exposed. The second stage starts three to five days after symptoms start, when a rash begins to appear on the face and spread to the rest of the body. People with measles are contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through a safe and effective MMR vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are given to provide lifetime protection. Virginia has high measles vaccination rates, with approximately 95% of kindergarteners fully vaccinated against measles. However, infants who are too young to be vaccinated, and others who are not vaccinated, are very susceptible to infection if they are exposed to measles. Infants six months through 11 months of age who will be traveling internationally, or to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/"&gt;outbreak setting&lt;/a&gt;, should receive one dose of MMR vaccine prior to travel. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check your immunization status, call your healthcare provider or request records from the &lt;a href="https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=NCMHWL3HK8"&gt;VDH Immunization Record Request Form&lt;/a&gt;. For additional information, contact your &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/local-health-districts/"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can call VDH at (804) 363-2704 or email &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4722372e1835223437282934220731232f69312e35202e292e2669202831"&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2c495c45735e495f5c43425f496c5a4844025a455e4b4542454d024b435a"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

ROACH: I am a 69-year-old female in excellent health, other than having been treated for breast cancer eight years ago. (I underwent surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, then five years on an aromatase inhibitor.) Since then, I have gained 40 pounds. I am 5 feet, 2 inches tall, and weigh 178 pounds. I have been unable to lose the weight despite working out at least 1 hour every day and following a healthy (Mediterranean-style) diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QPBQDVLLBJFJJEEANP5DOJ36YE"&gt;I am told by my oncologist that being within a healthy BMI weight range is one of the best things I can do to prevent reoccurrence. I was told by another physician to limit my calories to 1,000 per day, but I found it difficult to maintain this low of a caloric intake given my activity level. Why can’t I lose weight despite all of my efforts? -- D.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HNHC2OLBBFDFLA32GUI6OE3PAU"&gt;ANSWER: The answer to this is beyond my power to answer, except to say that humans have evolved to be able to survive with very little food, and we have adaptations that let us survive. Most people in industrial countries no longer have times of prolonged famine, so the human trait of holding on to our energy supplies (mostly fat) is no longer adaptive, since excess weight is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SI3EHBH6S5FDNJ6TZWJN54XCQU"&gt;In the case of breast cancer, women with a higher BMI do have higher rates of recurrence compared to women in the “normal” range, which was defined as 18.5-25. (This is well below the average weight among women in the United States.) The BMI is a flawed measurement but is still commonly used in studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7OUWFFKPD5DZHG6O6VH77E7TYE"&gt;In a large study, women with a BMI of 18.5-25 had a 1.7% risk of recurrence per year, while women with a BMI of 30-35 (yours is 32.4) had a 2.2% risk of recurrence per year. This is a significant amount but may not be as much as you were expecting. I disagree that weight is a major factor in breast cancer reoccurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LXHZIRDRAVAXVJBEMEZQIDZWPI"&gt;In most of my patients, I recommend against weight loss as a primary goal. I would much rather have my patients eat well (a Mediterranean-style diet is an excellent choice) and exercise regularly (1 hour a day is great) than restrict calories to lose weight. However, there are times when weight loss is important in addition to a healthy diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="L6424F45P5DJ7G6ZR4XMCSDE2Y"&gt;In postmenopausal women with breast cancer, it is reasonable to consider that an effective means of weight loss might reduce cancer recurrences, but this is unproven. I did read studies showing that GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (Wegovy) or tirzepatide (Zepbound) were effective for weight loss in women with breast cancer. However, different kinds of studies would be needed to see whether they (or another kind of weight-loss treatment, such as bariatric surgery) reduce relapse rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZIBE4GU63NFO7GTANVTJGQKBMU"&gt;Since these drugs are very expensive, it is difficult to afford them for most people without insurance, and insurance companies generally require either severe obesity or a demonstration of weight-related morbidities (such as sleep apnea) to prescribe these drugs.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list key-takeaways"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly half (48%) of depression patients don’t respond to standard treatments, revealing a significant gap in mental healthcare effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Treatment-resistant depression is linked to worse physical health, higher unemployment, and an average of five years shorter lifespan compared to treatable depression.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Both patients and healthcare providers report frustration with unclear treatment pathways, highlighting the need for specialized approaches rather than more “trial and error” medication attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIRMINGHAM, England —&lt;/strong&gt; What happens when the treatments for depression simply don’t work? For nearly half of all patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, this isn’t a hypothetical question—it’s their daily reality. A comprehensive new study of over 2,400 people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) pulls back the curtain on a crisis hiding in plain sight, revealing how this condition extends far beyond persistent sadness to wreak havoc on physical health, employment, and patients’ relationships with healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2024.275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by a team from the University of Birmingham and Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Trust, the study exposes another &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health crisis&lt;/a&gt; that’s been hiding in plain sight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-standard-depression-treatments-fail"&gt;When Standard Depression Treatments Fail&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers Kiranpreet Gill and Danielle Hett found that a shocking 48% of major depressive disorder patients qualify as having &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/nasal-spray-treatment-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatment-resistant&lt;/a&gt; depression—meaning they didn’t get better after trying at least two different antidepressants at proper doses for enough time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve taken that many &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/antidepressants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; that my synapses are just frazzled,” said one study participant, expressing the exhaustion that comes with TRD. The admission captures the weariness that patients experience after cycling through multiple unsuccessful treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study revealed some startling patterns: people with TRD had much higher rates of recurring depression, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/adhd-4-times-more-likely-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt;, personality disorders, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/digital-self-harm-surging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;self-harm&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who responded to treatment. Even more concerning, patients with TRD who died were on average five years younger than those with standard depression—hinting that this persistent condition might actually shorten lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the research found healthcare providers often felt helpless when treating these complex cases, creating a mutual experience of frustration.”My doctor doesn’t know what to do with me,” confessed another participant from the study. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-permanent-part-of-who-they-are"&gt;‘A Permanent Part Of Who They Are’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fallout from treatment-resistant depression goes far beyond mental distress. Nearly 37% of patients in the study had tried four or more different antidepressants without finding relief, showing how current treatment approaches often amount to educated guesswork. This pattern of repeated medication failures leads many patients to believe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/"&gt;their depression&lt;/a&gt; is a permanent part of who they are rather than a treatable condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRD also disrupts work life significantly. Job inactivity was much higher among TRD patients (41.24% compared to 32.60% for standard depression), showing how persistent depression can wreck someone’s ability to maintain employment and financial stability. These numbers reveal the wider social costs of inadequate depression treatment—costs counted not just in healthcare spending but in lost &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/productivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;productivity&lt;/a&gt; and human potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection between TRD and physical health problems stood out dramatically in the data. Patients whose depression didn’t respond to treatments had much higher rates of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, breathing problems, digestive issues, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. This powerful mind-body link shows how depression affects the entire system, breaking down the false separation between mental and physical health that still exists in many healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-healthcare-system-s-shortcomings"&gt;The Healthcare System’s Shortcomings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For doctors working with these patients, the challenges run deep. The study found inconsistent terminology and classification criteria for TRD, with healthcare providers using terms like “chronic depression” or “recurrent depression” interchangeably. This lack of standard language complicates treatment planning and makes it harder to implement evidence-based approaches. The qualitative data revealed that healthcare providers struggled with unclear guidelines, with one clinician specifically stating, “I’m not even sure of pathways for depression within secondary care that are not diagnosis-specific… they should be made more explicit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/best-healthcare-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare system&lt;/a&gt; itself emerged as part of the problem. Despite their more complex conditions, patients with TRD were less likely to be referred to community-based mental health services compared to standard depression patients. Instead, they were more often sent to specialized services or inpatient care—suggesting a reactive rather than preventive approach to treatment resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This pattern reveals a troubling gap: treatment-resistant depression patients tend to receive either highly specialized interventions or minimal community support, with few options in between. The study documented patients’ frustrations with inconsistent care, with one person explicitly stating they felt “left in limbo” after being in the system for nearly four years without consistent treatment. This lack of continuity creates feelings of abandonment exactly when ongoing therapeutic relationships are most crucial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that TRD hits harder with each treatment that fails. People who’d cycled through four or more antidepressants were less likely to hold jobs and had more additional health problems than those who’d tried fewer medications. This worsening pattern shows that treatment resistance isn’t just a fixed state—it’s something that can get worse over time if doctors can’t find effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-depression-treatment"&gt;Rethinking Depression Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/there-are-6-different-types-of-depression-brain-pattern-study-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;For patients&lt;/a&gt; trying to find their way through this difficult terrain, the experience often feels like stumbling through a maze blindfolded. According to the study interviews, patients described the treatment process as “trial and error,” highlighting the frustrating absence of clear treatment paths. The research also found that clinicians pointed to a lack of dedicated funding or structured care routes for depression compared to other conditions like psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Study participants and clinicians offered valuable suggestions for improvement. These included creating easy-to-understand information about TRD, developing clear pathways to specialized services, offering more diverse psychological treatments beyond cognitive-behavioral therapy, and increasing research opportunities. Both groups stressed the importance of having a complete approach with steady input from the same clinician—a stark contrast to the fragmented care many currently receive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, TRD patients simply wanted their healthcare providers &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/doctors-interrupt-patients-after-11-seconds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to listen to them&lt;/a&gt;. Acknowledging their struggle and recognizing their condition as a distinct form of depression needing specialized attention emerged as crucial first steps toward improvement. Study authors quoted a healthcare provider who advocated for a more patient-centered approach: “I think we need to have different conversations around what care would patients like and what care would help them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ decision to combine statistical data with personal stories points to a better way of studying &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;—one that respects both hard numbers and human experiences. This approach recognizes that good mental health care needs both scientific facts and real-life accounts. By weaving these viewpoints together, the study team hasn’t just shown how big the problem is—they’ve suggested fixes that actually make sense in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings demand we completely rethink &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how we treat depression&lt;/a&gt;—recognizing that it comes in many forms and needs targeted solutions for people who don’t respond to standard approaches. For the millions struggling with TRD worldwide, change needs to happen now. The urgency for change is clear from the study’s interviews, with patients expressing deep frustration after enduring years of unsuccessful treatments and cycling through numerous medications without finding relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers used two complementary approaches to get a complete picture of treatment-resistant depression. They analyzed electronic health records from over 5,100 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder from a large UK National Health Service trust serving 1.3 million people in Birmingham and Solihull. They identified patients with MDD who were receiving care up to 2021, excluding those who also had bipolar disorder, psychosis, dementia, or neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treatment-resistant depression was defined using the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines: failing to respond to at least two antidepressants given at proper doses for 4-6 weeks, with the patient then moving to a third antidepressant or add-on drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For personal insights, the research team conducted 15 in-depth interviews with eight healthcare providers (including psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, and nurses) and seven people with TRD. The interviews explored what it’s like to live with or treat TRD, opinions about current treatments, and ideas for improvement. The study was developed with input from a group of people with lived experience of depression, ensuring patient perspectives shaped the research design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study showed that nearly half (48%) of MDD patients met the criteria for treatment-resistant depression, with 36.9% having tried four or more antidepressant treatments without adequate response. People with TRD had higher rates of recurring depression compared to those with standard MDD (31.76% vs. 26.62%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis found several factors linked to treatment resistance. Patients with TRD had higher rates of recurring depression (odds ratio = 1.24), anxiety disorders (odds ratio = 1.21), personality disorders (odds ratio = 1.35), self-harm (odds ratio = 1.76), and heart diseases (odds ratio = 1.46). Job inactivity was also substantially higher among TRD patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthcare use patterns revealed that people with TRD had fewer referrals to community mental healthcare services compared to MDD patients (40% vs. 45%) but were more frequently referred to specialist services (20% vs. 15%) and hospital services (5% vs. 3%). This indicates a gap in continuous, community-based care for those with treatment resistance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interviews identified six major themes: limited understanding of TRD classification, emotional impact of living with or treating TRD, experiences with current treatment approaches, barriers to effective treatment, things that help treatment work better, and recommendations for future care approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge several limitations to their findings. The data primarily came from secondary care prescribing records and lacked integration with primary care information, potentially limiting insight into treatment resistance progression before referral to specialty care. Physical health comorbidities may be underreported in mental health electronic records, which typically focus on psychiatric diagnoses rather than comprehensive medical histories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reported rates of self-harm were likely significant underestimates, as these incidents are often recorded in free-text clinical notes rather than structured diagnostic fields. Additionally, the qualitative component focused primarily on non-prescribing clinicians, which may have influenced perspectives on TRD terminology and treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the retrospective nature of the quantitative analysis, spanning records from 1996 to 2021, introduced potential variability in reporting practices over time, requiring caution when interpreting longitudinal trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion and Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that TRD represents a complex clinical challenge requiring personalized, innovative approaches beyond the current “one-size-fits-all” model. The study highlights the progressive nature of treatment resistance, with increasing mental and physical comorbidities and functional decline associated with each failed treatment attempt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians are urged to recognize TRD as a marker for increased morbidity and to consider new treatment strategies when patients fail to respond to two sequential antidepressants. The link between treatment resistance and economic inactivity suggests a need to integrate vocational and long-term functional support into TRD management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommend developing standardized TRD care pathways within healthcare systems, providing tailored information for patients, improving access to diverse psychological treatments, enhancing clinician training about TRD, and adopting holistic treatment approaches with consistent provider input. They also advocate for low-intensity, high-frequency support options such as peer groups and occupational therapy, contrary to current treatment models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess visceral fat can increase your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifting weights is one of the most effective ways to help reduce visceral fat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before you start a weight lifting routine, consider consulting a personal trainer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-to-lose-visceral-fat-8703419" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; is a type of fat found in your abdominal cavity, surrounding your internal organs. In excess, it can increase your risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. If you’ve ever searched for the best exercise to lose weight, specifically visceral fat, you may have come across some unrealistic or downright outlandish workout plans. But what if the most effective exercise was one you hadn’t even considered? One tried-and-true exercise method that has been praised for years by experts often goes overlooked. Below, we reveal why &lt;strong&gt;lifting weights is the No. 1 surprising exercise for reducing visceral fat&lt;/strong&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lifting weights is a form of resistance or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;. It improves muscular fitness by working specific muscles or groups of muscles. You can lift weights by picking up dumbbells, using weight machines or even using your own body weight (think squats or pushups).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We also consult two sports dietitians to discuss why it works and share their tips on how to add it to your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-lifting-weights-works-for-reducing-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Lifting Weights Works for Reducing Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lifting weights helps reduce visceral fat by increasing muscle mass, which helps boost resting metabolism and promotes fat oxidation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.thesportsnutritionplaybook.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Goodson, M.S., RD, CSSD, LD,&lt;/a&gt; a sports dietitian and owner of The Sports Nutrition Playbook.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The body consists of muscle and fat mass—both of which are essential. If you recall back to high school health class, your teacher may have held up life-size models of 1 pound of muscle and 1 pound of fat. While they weigh the same, fat takes up more space, while muscle mass is more dense and compact. When you start lifting weights regularly, your body tends to lose fat mass (including visceral fat) while simultaneously building dense and more compact muscle tissue. This leads to a change in body composition, and you don’t even have to cut calories to see results.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “In the absence of intentional caloric restriction, resistance training seems to decrease visceral fat in individuals with and without obesity alike,” says Marie Spano, M.S., RD, CSCS, CSSD, sports nutritionist for the Washington Nationals and Atlanta Hawks. She points to a study that found resistance training effectively reduced visceral fat in individuals both with and without obesity, even without a calorie restriction.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This could be due to the fact that there’s an afterburn effect that occurs with lifting weights. “While cardio burns calories during exercise, weight lifting continues to burn calories post-workout through excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), making it highly effective for fat loss,” explains Goodson. A study on women found that just 30 minutes of resistance training significantly increased expenditure, with effects detected up to 14 hours post-exercise, and boosted resting metabolic rate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, lifting weights (along with other forms of exercise) can help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7822525/mental-benefits-of-exercise/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relieve stress&lt;/a&gt;, which may also support visceral fat loss. Strength training has been linked to lower stress levels, which can further reduce the likelihood of visceral fat accumulation, says Goodson. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-gaining-muscle-can-help-you-lose-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Gaining Muscle Can Help You Lose Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The more muscle a body holds the more calories it burns each day,” says Spano. The reason for this is because muscle mass is more metabolically active than fat (which is a good thing!). The more metabolically active tissue you have, the more calories you burn, even at rest. This means that even when you’re lounging on the couch, your body is still burning more calories if you have more muscle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spano explains that as you gain muscle, your body’s overall calorie expenditure increases. “When calorie output is higher than calories consumed, the body taps into its fat stores, including visceral fat,” she adds. In other words, if you are burning more than what you’re eating, it can help reduce body fat, including visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, gaining muscle helps support healthy hormone production, which in turn can reduce visceral fat. Goodson explains, “Muscle helps improve hormonal balance, reducing cortisol levels that can contribute to abdominal fat accumulation.” Research has shown a link between stress and obesity, and elevated levels of cortisol (the body’s stress hormone) are associated with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-stress-cause-weight-gain-8653248" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, especially around the abdominal cavity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Building up muscle through exercise can improve the body’s sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Research suggests lifting weights helps lower blood sugar levels by enhancing insulin function and reduces the likelihood of excess glucose being stored as fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-started-weight-lifting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get Started Weight Lifting &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting something new can be intimidating, but you can consult an expert in the field. Spano recommends that beginners begin weight lifting by booking a session with a personal trainer or strength coach. She says, “They can assess your current state of fitness and develop a plan that fits into your lifestyle and also utilizes the equipment readily available to you while also helping you set realistic goals.” Working with a professional can also help teach you how to use equipment and prevent injury. It’s always a good idea to loop in your primary care provider before starting any new training regimen, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Goodson suggests that beginners start with full-body strength training exercises like squats, dead lifts, lunges and pushups. She recommends first focusing on nailing down the correct form, as it can help prevent injury. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you feel comfortable, you can add body weight, resistance bands or light dumbbells, before gradually progressing to heavier weights. If you can, work your way up to two to three training sessions per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For significant visceral fat reduction, Goodson recommends weight lifting three to five times per week, alternating upper and lower body days, combined with a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021744/meal-plan-to-gain-more-muscle/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating plan&lt;/a&gt; and adequate recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lifting weights is the No. 1 surprising exercise for reducing visceral fat, according to experts. Weight lifting helps change body composition by increasing muscle mass, which is metabolically active and can burn more calories even while you’re at rest. Gaining muscle can increase your metabolic rate and regulate hormones, which also contributes to reducing visceral fat. Before you start, consider consulting with your health care team and a personal trainer to learn proper weight-lifting form. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can gradually increase the weight and frequency of your weight-lifting sessions.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if, alongside a little Ultherapy for a saggy neck and a few zaps of Clear + Brilliant laser for loathsome sun spots, you could boost your mood and zap brain fog on the same office visit? Courtesy of a new magnetic-field treatment dubbed &lt;a href="https://bodybybtl.com/solutions/exomind/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Exomind&lt;/a&gt;, patients of Manhattan dermatologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://pfrankmd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;Paul Jarrod Frank&lt;/a&gt; can do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And no one sounds more excited about Exomind than Frank himself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I actually went to medical school to become a psychiatrist, and I feel that I use my skills and background in psychology every day,” Frank says. “With the overwhelming demand and advancements in functional and longevity medicine, beauty, health, and wellness no longer sit on opposite ends of the cafeteria. They are all integrally woven into helping people achieve the best version of themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That level of self-actualization doesn’t come cheap; at Frank’s practice, the recommended six-session course of treatment clocks in at $4,800. And while the skin doc assures that lasting effects kick-in after the third session, most partakers can expect occasional maintenance visits to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created by Prague-based medical device purveyor BTL, Exomind is a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment designed to improve mental and emotional well-being and is FDA-approved for the treatment of depression. In Canada, it also gets the green light for helping to tackle anxiety, OCD and issues with compulsive eating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Frank, who deploys multiple BTL-crafted devices at his practice, including Emsculpt for body contouring and Emsella for treating postpartum incontinence, Exomind is based on well-established technology called TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation). To drill down the science, magnetic fields are used to boost neuron activity in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the portion of the brain that regulates mood and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with the older versions of TMS technology is that they were very time-consuming, requiring multiple consecutive days for hours at a time,” says Frank. “It wasn’t realistic for patients unless they had severe emotional and mental disease states.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Frank isn’t expecting his own patient population to seek out Exomind for the treatment of major mental illness, they may be looking for help with dealing with digital distraction and the stress and anxiety of city life. And for many, the hope of getting off prescription meds via soothing, 30-minute Exomind sessions is enough of a lure to give them a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City-based media buyer Olivia Kessler, who completed her sixth Exomind session at the PFrankMD Upper East Side office in February, found the treatments so chill she even fell asleep during one of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having already tried Emsculpt, Kessler was familiar with the technology and trusted Frank’s suggestion that Exomind might be another tool in her kit to help with mood swings generated by her longstanding PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A “naturally stressed” city dweller who says she feels the need to be hypervigilant at all times, Kessler was also seeking an alternative to the generic version of Prozac her doctor prescribed for dealing with her pre-menstrual emotional rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only has Exomind helped with mood regulation, it’s also curbed any tendency Kessler had toward procrastination. “I feel like I have a pep in my step,” she says, “a little extra energy that I didn’t have before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Kessler, parking herself on Frank’s office couch with an electro-magnetic skullcap for half an hour at a pop has been worth the time and money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I stan Exomind,” says Kessler. “And I definitely stan trying not to be on medications forever.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A method for slowing disease progress in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; patients may also delay onset in people predisposed to the disease who are yet to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The just-published results from a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; on an experimental drug targeting amyloid plaque buildup suggest the treatment can indeed put the brakes on cognitive decline, if it's taken early enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am highly optimistic now, as this could be the first clinical evidence of what will become preventions for people at risk for Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/anti-amyloid-drug-shows-signs-of-preventing-alzheimers-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Washington University neurologist and senior author, Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One day soon, we may be delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease for millions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155802" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155802" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/cognitive-decline_male_642.jpg" alt="man with alzheimer's" class="wp-image-155802 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/cognitive-decline_male_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/cognitive-decline_male_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155802" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Delaying or even preventing cognitive decline in individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's could help millions around the world. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFi_oFnotg/"&gt;Dusan Stankovic/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved 73 volunteers with Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's, which is caused by genes that ramp up the production of the amyloid protein. Though the mutations are responsible for just 1 percent of all Alzheimer's cases, they make the &lt;a href="https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/for-the-community/volunteer-for-research/dian"&gt;development of the condition&lt;/a&gt; by their 50s a near certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/clinical-trials/dominantly-inherited-alzheimer-network-trial-unit-dian-tu"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, research was initiated into the potential of a therapy based on a combination of two  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in slowing the progress of the disease in individuals with no or with minor cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2304430"&gt;phase 3 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; failed to impact the symptoms of the two groups, one of the drugs – gantenerumab – seemed to cause dramatic improvements in the pathology itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by the clinical signs of a drop in protein markers, researchers continued investigations into whether higher doses of the treatment might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with higher-risk mutations were invited to remain with the trial and receive the drug regardless of whether they were initially in the control group that had only been given the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension was itself cut short due to the failure of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155792" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to meet established goals, but an analysis of gantenerumab's impact established it still had potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who had taken the drug for both the trial period and its extension had their risk of developing symptoms cut in half. The effect might even be more dramatic – the risk of the non-symptomatic group declining in mental health only increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With time, comparisons between those who had taken the drug since 2012 and those who had only taken it for a couple of years, could yet show an even greater chance of delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone in this study was destined to develop Alzheimer's disease and some of them haven't yet," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/anti-amyloid-drug-shows-signs-of-preventing-alzheimers-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we do know is that it's possible at least to delay the onset of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and give people more years of healthy life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using antibodies in this fashion isn't without risk. Gantenerumab and similar treatments have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/rg.230009"&gt;tiny bleeds and swellings&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, which in rare circumstances can become fatal. Microbleeds are also &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000011542"&gt;known to increase&lt;/a&gt; as Alzheimer's progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other next-generation anti-amyloid treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;have been approved in the US&lt;/a&gt; for the treatment of individuals who have Alzheimer's symptoms, potentially adding years of improved cognition to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-man-fated-to-get-alzheimers-avoided-it-for-decades-but-how"&gt;Time will tell&lt;/a&gt; whether those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;anticipating &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt; neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-biomarker-can-foreshadow-early-alzheimers-years-before-symptoms"&gt;coming decades&lt;/a&gt; may also be given a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-healthy-lifestyle-beat-alzheimers-like-documentary-claims"&gt;reprieve&lt;/a&gt;.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I have to tell you, as a parent, something I think about a lot is how to have real, authentic conversations with my three teenage daughters. It can be hard sometimes. I realize that things are different for their generation. They have smartphones and screens and influencers. There is news that is constantly blaring everywhere. It's a different time. And a lot has changed right down to our biology. Take, for instance, puberty. It's one of the most awkward and yet important stages of growing up. But even that has changed. The average start of puberty in the United States now begins at eight years old for girls and nine for boys. Some kids are going through puberty even earlier than that. It also last much longer than it did before. For some people, puberty can last for up to a decade. Just think about that. All of this might come as a surprise to you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              People know a lot about the puberty they went through, but it is not the same now.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:05
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's doctor Cara Natterson. She's a pediatrician and she's a parent. She's author of the New York Times bestselling series for girls called The Care and Keeping of You. She also has a sequel for boys called Guy stuff. She's an expert on puberty, so I decided to sit down to talk to her and try and learn. Why are kids going through puberty earlier, and is that early puberty really the new norm? I think most importantly for me, as a dad of three teenage girls, what do parents need to know about how to help their children navigate it? I'm Doctor Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, and this is chasing life. So if you're a parent and I'm just guessing we're around the same age because I know you have two college athletes who are teenagers still, I think, or maybe early 20s, and I have three teenagers. So right around that same age, the way that we think about puberty is parents. But even I think as physicians may be totally different than than what our kids are going through. You're a pediatrician, so you obviously have updated knowledge, but for me, as just a dad, it's a totally different thing compared to 30, 40, 50 years ago.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Even up until the late 1990s, we were all taught in medical school that puberty begins around 11 or 11.5 and it takes about two, three, four years. It's a sprint and you get through it and it's super awkward and your body changes and then you're done. That was sort of the teaching and the medical school more detailed teaching was not a whole lot more detailed. It was that the path through puberty were these stages called the Tanner stages. And Tanner looked at breast development. He looked at penile and testicular growth, and he looked at hair growth. And he did these studies in the 1940s and 50s and 60s. In an orphanage outside of London. And that's where he collected all of his data. So five stages, Tanner one. Nothing's happening. You're not in it. Tanner five, you're totally done. And two, three and four. That's puberty. Girls go into puberty around age 11. They're earlier kids or later kids. But that was about it. And boys around 11.5 now. And we started to get this knowledge in the late 1990s, when a study was published by a doctor of public health named Marsha Herman Giddens. She published a study, 17,000 girls, that showed, nope, it's not 11 anymore. It's ten. And in fact, if you looked at kids according to their race, kids who are black. Their average age of pubertal onset was even earlier, and we could talk about that study and what that did, but that really rocked the world. And that was more than 25 years ago, by the way. And then more data came out. And Louise Greenspan, with others, published data in 2010 that looked to confirm that original data. And it didn't just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further. So starting in 2010, right, 14 years ago, we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country. And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening. I did not know it was happening in my own house, because it's when boys tend to get private, but that average age is between 9 and 10. So that's different. That's two years different from when we were growing up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:57
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So 11, 11.5 was what the onset of puberty. That's the age that we all sort of learned, at least when we were in medical school. And now it's become younger, maybe even as young as eight. Is that normal puberty now or is that considered early onset puberty or early puberty? How do you refer to it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:18
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love this question because I think definition of terms is the most important starting place. Right. So 8 to 9 is an average. Normal can be earlier than eight for some groups of girls. So as a pediatrician, when I was starting in practice in the year 2000, if a kid had secondary sex characteristics, if their bodies were starting to change, usually it meant breast development. And it happened before age eight. They would come into my office to see me. That was considered atypical or abnormal. Now that post has moved back to seven. So if a kid is younger than seven, they'll come see a pediatrician. But if they're over seven. Most advice is that is within the normal range. Oh, and by the way, if they're 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal. So now wrap your brain around a 5 or 6 year spread of normal onset of body changes. That's really hard for everyone to manage. And I'll add one more term that's really important. So puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation. So when you start puberty. You cannot be part of a baby making equation, and when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby. That's the definition of puberty very narrowly. The broader definition, as we talked about earlier, is all the other downstream shifts from all of those sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen and progesterone floating around the body in the brain? Mood swings, friendships shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the point is puberty isn't always straightforward. Things that seem like puberty, using that narrow definition might technically not be puberty.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:32
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There's this thing called adrenarche that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEA s, and these hormones are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. Nostrum. And when the adrenal glands release these hormones, these hormones tell the body to make more sweat and in certain places to make it with greasier thicker proteins and to sprout more hair. Some places it's new hair, some places the hair texture and color changes that sweat hair. You can imagine how body odor and pimples are related. Right? That is not puberty. That's called adrenarche. It happens around the same time as puberty. But in some kids it can happen much earlier. So a five year old can have pubic hair and they're not in puberty. Or a 15 year old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness, and no pubic hair growth. It's confusing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:47
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Adrenarche and puberty can be totally disparate in terms of is there a relationship at all between. Yes. I mean.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:08:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, because the hormones are all cousins and they can convert forms. So DHEA and DHEAS can convert into testosterone and forms of estrogen. I should add, people always ask about where body weight fits in. And the answer to that is in many bodies that carry extra weight, they have what what's called peripheral conversion of these hormones. So DHEA and DHEAS when they're floating around, the body can convert more easily into the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone when there's more body fat, which is one of the bridges that connects this, which is one of the reasons why kids who carry extra body weight tip into puberty, typically a little earlier.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:45
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This is fascinating. And I mean, the question I think a lot of people will ask which are which are addressing here is, is why over the last 30, 40 or 50 years, has puberty become something that is happening younger and younger? I, you know, again, this is just me, me talking here. I had heard about high body weight being a concern because of, as you say, what the added fat might do. I had also heard about potential environmental factors playing a role here, and I'm curious what what your thoughts are on that. But this idea of stress hormones, you know, I think of stress hormones as sort of short acting hormones. The idea that sort of a persistent exposure to high levels, for example, of cortisol, could also be a culprit in tipping people into puberty earlier. I had not considered that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So the cortisol is for sure a short acting hormone. But when your adrenal glands are pumping it out 24 over seven. Because you're on social media reacting to what you're seeing, or because you're living in a stressful environment where you're expected to be an academic achiever or an athletic achiever, or if you're living in a stressful environment because you don't know where your next meal is coming from, or you don't know where you're going to sleep that night. So all of these things are what we call stressors. And by the way, there's no value judgment to be placed on which stressor is more or less important. But now you can see why every kid is exposed to stress, quote unquote stress, right? We love to throw around that term. What does it mean? It means anything that tells your adrenal glands to pump out cortisol. And the stressors are there all the time. They're there all the time. When we went to school, we came home at the end of the day, and any dynamic that happened at school was left at school. Maybe someone called us on the corded phone and maybe one of our siblings. Let us take the call. Otherwise they were busy on the corded phone. Right now there is round the clock. Social dynamics. Romantic dynamics. Right. But I don't want to demonize this either. I think it's really, really important to be level about all this. I mean, social media, for instance. For sure. There's a connection here. But social media has also been shown to save lives, to build community for people who are marginalized and don't have it. It's too easy to be black and white about this. And so I think it's very important for us to recognize the role of stress and stressors, but also to recognize that some of the things we call stressors have huge upsides and huge positive benefits. I would never argue that the aces, the adverse childhood experiences that cause stress like food insecurity, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, witnessing violence, living in a traumatic situation. There is no upside to any of those stressors, but a lot of these sort of stressors in lives that are less challenged by ACS have positives and negatives.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Stress in and of itself is not the enemy. It's the relentless nature of stress, I guess, is what I'm hearing you say.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              But I don't want to send people, you know, sort of screaming for the hills and stressed out because it is not a switch which goes from 0 to 100. With puberty. When we were growing up, the path for puberty was fast. Today, even though it's starting earlier, it is actually happening more slowly. So it's not like an eight year old wakes up one morning in the body of an 18 year old. It is not what's happening. What is happening is eight year olds. If their girls might be developing breast buds, they might just have breast buds for a while. It is not like they are going to have their full adult breast size immediately. And this is another thing that is layering sort of the confusion and the, the, the sense of I don't know how to help the kid in my life. Parents don't know how seriously to take any of this. And there's worry. I mean, it's just it's a mess. It's a mess of information that is so easily remedied with just some simple facts. So fact one puberty is starting earlier. Fact two it's going slower. It's going slower. Girls are getting their period a little bit earlier than they used to, but not three years earlier. It's more like somewhere between 3 and 6 months.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:14:42
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What about the racial divide? So when you take all these factors that could potentially be causing puberty to happen sooner. Why? Why racial divide?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:51
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Every researcher that I trust is landing at the same conclusion, which it's going to turn out not to be race. It's going to turn out to be zip code. So if you take this explanation of cortisol being at the heart of everything that's going on, and you look at the way this country sets up and the socioeconomic divide and the racial divide, it's you can't argue that the two are not completely overlapped. It's a very, very hard to look at the sociological data and say, oh, yes, we can account for racial shifts in puberty separate from zip code, socioeconomic shifts and puberty. So it's kids who are more stressed and more under-resourced, who are entering puberty the soonest. Now everyone's entering sooner. On average, the trend line is down because of something you mentioned earlier, which is these amorphous environmental causes. So the way I would describe that bucket is everything we put into and onto our body is impacting our body. Right? So it's everything from the toiletries, the cosmetics that we use, the shampoos and cleansers and moisturizers. Many, many, many of them contain chemicals in them that disrupt the hormones in our body. They change the way hormones signal. Likewise, the pollution in the air that we breathe impacts the way our bodies work, right? Everything. The water we're drinking, depending upon what's in the food we're eating, what's, you know, antibiotics that are pumped into animals that then end up on grocery shelves. There's tons of data that shows that those antibiotics shift the way our body's immune system works are inflammatory cascade. We have inflammation as a result that has impacts on the sex hormones. So it's a lot of things coming at us. But it's a reminder that there are some really incredible scientists out there who are trying to figure out what are these lowest common denominator chemicals that are showing up in these various environmental insults. We call them insults, right, that are changing the way the hormones work in our body so that we can get rid of them. And that's really important. And right now, the foods that don't have antibiotics are the toiletries Cosmetics that don't have a whole list of chemical ingredients tend to be more expensive. Right? So right. We're back to zip code. We're back to the socioeconomic drivers of puberty. So it's complicated.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              If you look at the data around the world, do you see differences geographically, by country or culture?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes. So net net puberty everywhere is starting earlier. And we've known this for a long time. And even in very remote areas we know that puberty is starting earlier. So that's that sort of global phenomenon of what people are putting into an onto their bodies and how chemicals are shifting the path through puberty. But it looks different from country to country and region to region. And the data is kind of all over the map. And in the US we tend to be a little bit on the earlier side. So the data shows our average start of puberty has been consistently at or below the average for the world.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:29
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So puberty happening earlier isn't just a thing happening in the United States. This is a global phenomenon. But I think the real question then is just how worried should we be about kids starting to develop earlier in life? And if we are worried, when then should we as parents get involved? We'll be right back. When we talk about blue zones and things like that, places where people live better, they live longer lives, they have more social connection. You can see the benefit, and the benefit usually is something like longevity. You live longer, you have a higher health span, things like that. The question that I really sort of struggle with when it comes to puberty is, is puberty starting earlier a bad thing?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We have no idea. I mean, because we have no data, right? So people ask this all the time, and the answer is we only have about 25,  26 years of evidence that puberty is really started to march earlier. And so the oldest of those kids are just in middle age now, right, entering middle age. So we don't know. But what we do know is there have been trends through history of when puberty has started earlier, when puberty has started later. We are so sure that earlier puberty is bad. And yet really, if you look back through the lens of history in cultures or in societies where there was no food available, what did those kids bodies do? Their bodies slowed down their development and puberty happened much later, and it makes great evolutionary sense. The whole point of puberty is to be able to be part of a baby making equation. If your body, if you are a female and your body cannot carry a fetus because you're so nutritionally deprived. You don't have the food you need. You don't have the nutritional resources. Well, then why would the body try to develop and get itself there in order to reproduce quickly? There's no rush. So there are times where you look through historical records, and the average age of pubertal onset is 16. And that's because in those societies there was a famine. And so I'm not saying earlier puberty is good. I think we have to put everything in context.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But just in terms of mental health risks. I've been reading some about this and how girls starting puberty earlier might come with added mental health risks. Is there evidence of that then? And do we know anything for boys as well?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:15
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So for girls, the data is pretty clear and it tethers to this early data about earlier puberty, earlier body changes, more sexualization, earlier risk for predation. If your body is changing. No one's talking to you about it, or the world thinks it's happening to you. Too young. So you're not getting informed in a certain way. But then the world is sexualizing you and expects for you to either think like you're older because you look like you're older, or to behave like you're older because you look like you're older. The set up for mental health issues is tremendous, right? Also, the sex hormones, whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty, they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed. You know, Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line. It is absolutely true. And that is where third and fourth grade parents are like, wow, my kid is in puberty. They are slamming the door. I mean, that is all those hormones rising and falling and and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts. It has to be a set up for mental health issues if we are not talking about it. I will add for boys, there has been no study that looks at testosterone and quiet, but I am 100% convinced that when someone finally studies it, we will see that testosterone surges and drops are what cause the silence of tween and teen boys. We know testosterone causes rage, but the other side of that pendulum swing is silence. And it's not that they don't talk, but they talk less. And then they are rewarded for talking less or. Today's generation of parents goes well that was what I did. And I just shut my door for three years and my parents didn't say anything and was totally fine. And I emerged out the other end, and I'm okay. And that the truth is that was then. This is now that sign that you see in boys where they just become monosyllabic or grunts. It is painful for parents, it is hormonal and there are ways through it. There are conversations you can have with your boys. There are ways to pull them out of their shell. They do emerge out the other side, but they do want to be talked to. I swear. They tell us all the time, just because they're not talking a lot, doesn't mean that they don't want to be included in the conversation.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:24:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This is so fascinating. I mean, I think anyone listening, myself included, is thinking about those teens in their life, whether their own kids or kids friends. And it tracks. It's so interesting. I mean, it's fascinating. Let me ask you this. So if parents come to you and say that my kid seems to be going through puberty very early. What is the conversation that you'd have with parents?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:24:29
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So let's start with this thing. Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider. This is really important. What they need to do is they need to have a conversation, and then they need to do a physical exam, and they need to actually look at your kid. I am a pediatrician. I did not examine my own child. I did not know when my son went into puberty, but it was not my job to be his pediatrician and to examine him and to determine that. So I would take him in for his annual checkup, and if there were any concerns in between, I would take him in. And it was the pediatrician who had the conversation with him and examined him, and then I could pick up the conversation from their. Pediatricians are trained to ask parents to leave the room. By the time a kid is about somewhere 11, 12, 13, 14, they're going to kick the parent out at some point. That's totally appropriate. Then call him up, ask him, or at the end of the visit, pull him aside. Hey, is my kid in puberty or do I need to worry about anything? There are so many ways into the conversation, but hopefully the theme here is coming through that talking about it is the most important thing.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:25:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Puberty can on average starts around 8 or 9, but it can be 6 or 7, you said. So I have a kid. I think they may be going through puberty at a very young age. Should I be worried about that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:07
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So before age seven, for a girl, before age eight for a boy, I would say you would want to bring in medical advice. You start seeing changes in the body. You want to bring in a medical finger, but you noticed I'm not using the word concerned or worried because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren't puberty.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:33
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But if it is happening before that age, what would the pediatrician be thinking?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Cara Natterson
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:26:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They're looking for what's called precocious puberty. And precocious puberty is puberty that's happening sooner than it should. And one of the causes of precocious puberty, which is not common, but it's always on the list for every pediatrician, is a tumor that is growing in the brain, that is telling the brain to secrete the hormones called LA and FSH, that tip the body into starting puberty. That's the main thing that people are looking for. It's a tumor that is causing the hormones to release early. But I hesitate to go down that road because more often than not, the concerns turn out to be not a worry, but a great opportunity for conversation with the pediatrician, right? So, for instance, if you have a kid who's carrying extra body weight and you think they're developing breasts and actually it's just fat tissue, and a doctor can examine them and show that it's just fat tissue and there's no breast tissue, it's still a great opportunity for a conversation about nutritional wellness.

              Right? Right. But what what are some of the approaches that you've implemented as a parent, with all you've known when it comes to talking about puberty?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The best tip I have is what I did with my son, so that my oldest is her daughter, who is just a talker. But my son was not a talker. And when he went through puberty, he became really not a talker. And that was very hard for me. So the first thing I learned how to do was to sit on the other side of a closed door. So I would sit on the other side of my son's door and I would knock on the door and I would say, hey, buddy, I'm actually just sitting on the other side of the door, and I would really love to hear what's going on, and I'm going to be here for about 5 or 10 minutes. And if you want to talk, I'm just happy to sit here and talk. And it's so funny we did. My partner Vanessa and I did a podcast episode with our two sons who were going off to college this month, and there's a part of the podcast where I talk about this with my son, and I'm like, do you remember this? And he's of course, I remember it because it worked. We didn't have to look at each other. We didn't have to. There was no vulnerability. I wasn't there was no worry, you know? He was so aware of me being worried about everything right then. And there was none of that with a closed door between us. And then eventually the door opened. And then my strategy became. And it is still to this day, my strategy. Knock on the door. Always knock. Go in. He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I'd be like, hey, then how you doing? And he'd start talking. No eye contact, but my laying on his bed and him sitting in his desk, at his desk, with his back to me, was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations. That is a way of communicating with a kid that works. Everyone says do it in the car. Car is great on a walk. On a walk is great. You're just not making eye contact. So that's what worked for me, and I hope that other people can take that advice, because the parents who taught me that I'm forever grateful.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:30:03
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I get to tell you another piece of crucial advice is to just start having these conversations. Just start talking. Have the conversations. The big ones, the small ones, the silly ones, the serious ones. Because you gotta know this. In this day and age, our kids are exposed to a lot early, and some of what they're exposed to, like it or not, is not what any parent would want.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:30:26
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12. Really? Yeah. Wow. And 15% of ten year olds have seen it. So if you're not having conversations like this about all of this smells and feelings and sex and all of it, if you're not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is. So it's time to get over the awkwardness. Educate yourself. Find your own trusted adult. We always tell kids to find a trusted adult. Adult find your own trusted adult, you know, bounce things off of them, but start having these conversations. They can be short. You can have many of them over many years. You will mess them up, I promise you. That's okay. Take a do over. Come back and say to your kid, you know what? I said that wrong. I want to try again. But it's really, really critical to know that there are information resources out there for them that compete with you. And if you want to be the source of information, it's up to you to do it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:31:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's up to you to do it. I think that's a really important point. If you're not having the conversation lightly, someone else is in some way, shape or form. Better that you do it, that you be the source because we owe it to our kids and to ourselves to do better. When talking about things like their bodies, the way they're changing what's on their minds. And yes, it might be uncomfortable. It might be awkward even, but it's okay. That's what chasing life is all about doing our best every day, even when it's not easy.

   &lt;p&gt;After writing 50 books, Pakistani American kids' book author &lt;a href="https://saadiafaruqi.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saadia Faruqi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is covering an issue she's never explored before in her newest title, &lt;em&gt;The Strongest Heart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the first time I've written a book that completely revolves around mental illness and the repercussions it has on family life, especially on kids," says Faruqi. "It's a topic that's very close to my heart and the theme is personal to me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Published in March, &lt;em&gt;The Strongest Heart&lt;/em&gt; follows Mo, a Pakistani American eighth grader, as he struggles to understand his Abbu — "father" in Urdu — who has schizophrenia. The book is based on Faruqi's own rocky relationship with her father, whom she believes also had this condition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Growing up in Karachi, Pakistan, Faruqi says she was afraid of her father's episodes and often felt confused. The adults never "sat me down and explained anything. Nobody said, 'Hey, don't be scared.' " She hopes &lt;em&gt;The Strongest Heart&lt;/em&gt;, geared toward middle schoolers, can offer comfort and strength to young people who live with someone with mental illness at home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, the book has earned &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG23OjSRlzZ/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;four starred reviews&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Review&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/saadia-faruqi/the-strongest-heart/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;writes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: "The portrayal of serious mental illness and the complex emotions of a child whose parent suffers from it are realistic, eye-opening and moving."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Faruqi, the Houston-based author of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/31/905804301/welcome-to-story-hour-100-favorite-books-for-young-readers#:~:text=Yasmin%20is%20a%20spunky%20second%2Dgrader%20who%20tries%20out%20all%20kinds%20of%20occupations%20%E2%80%94%20superhero%2C%20writer%2C%20chef%2C%20zookeeper%20%E2%80%94%20whether%20or%20not%20she%20actually%20knows%20what%27s%20involved.%20But%20she%20always%20has%20fun%2C%20thanks%20to%20her%20quick%20thinking%20and%20support%20from%20her%20big%20Pakistani%20American%20family.%20(For%20ages%205%20to%208)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kids' book series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about a Pakistani-American girl named Yasmin, talks to NPR about mental health in Pakistan and what she wishes she could say to her dad if he were alive today. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like for you growing up in Pakistan with a father who had mental illness? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was frightening. I never knew which dad I was going to get. When I walked into the house from school, I dreaded going inside because I didn't know whether he was going to be angry or loving.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What the grown-ups knew was not always what the kids knew because there was no sharing of information. What I have pieced together is based on things I eavesdropped on as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;We think he had schizophrenia. He could have also had an adjacent kind of mental illness because many of these illnesses share a lot of symptoms. It was very unclear. [In Pakistan], there was no good way of diagnosing mental illness.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you cope? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I got completely immersed in books, especially those that took me away in terms of fantasy and had witches and dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the literature in those times was British because [Pakistan] used to be a colony of the British, and Enid Blyton, Jane Austen and Daphne du Maurier were favorite authors. Then once I entered high school, I got immersed in Shakespeare. That was the first time I realized how powerful words could be to bring about emotion in other people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did society treat your dad in Pakistan? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People would say, "He's just mad. He's crazy. Don't talk to him."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I was very sensitive about this when going out. If we were at a family wedding, I had this perception that people were whispering about me or my family. There was so much shame around it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is mental health perceived in your culture? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a lot of poor countries, there are no financial or medical resources. There's no understanding that if someone is acting in a certain way, there could be a reason. It may not be their fault. They may need medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if you say that to another person, they might see it as an attack. They might think: you're insulting me. It's very sad. So we do need more education, more empathy toward people who may have those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a wonderful character in the book, Naila Phupo, who is Mo's paternal aunt. She gives Mo attention, love and care — and ultimately, gets Mo's dad the medical help he needs. Tell me about her.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wanted Mo to have someone who could support him and not just treat him like all the relatives treated me in my family, who did not at all seem concerned. Or maybe they were concerned, but that concern was not evident to me or did not lead to any action.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you don't do anything as an adult, what's the point? So I wanted to have a character Mo could rely on to make change and help his dad get better.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mo's mom is an aid worker at a refugee camp in Greece and is often away. Why didn't you want her in the picture? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Again, this story is personal. Even though my mother did not leave us, emotionally she was often not present because of her job, her career and her organization. She was an educator of educators. By the end of my time in Pakistan, she was the principal of a teacher's training college, and she started a professional development society for English teachers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Everyone thought my mom was a saint for being my dad's wife, for taking care of not just him but our entire household. But she's also got her flaws. My mom was the only thing between us siblings and our dad and we often did not have that protection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why I needed Mo's mom to leave and also be somebody everyone loved. Mo's mom had a job that people were impressed with,  but only her own family knew what she was doing was wrong. She had abandoned her child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interspersed in the narrative, there are South Asian folktales about a jackal who is punished for pretending to be a king and a foolish man who puts all his eggs in a basket. Why did you decide to weave them into your book? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wanted to break up the tension and the negative scenes with something uplifting. Those folktales reflect how Mo is feeling and what's going on in his life and alleviate his sadness or grief or anger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your book's epilogue, you write that your dad died several years ago and you did not have a good relationship with him. If you could tell him anything now, what would you say? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I would apologize. Whenever I used to visit him, I would fight with him. I was finally taking charge of my anger and being able to talk back as an adult, because I never could as a child.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I would hug him. He was such a huggy person. I always hated it because of the relationship we had. So I would hug him and kiss him and tell him that I loved him. I think he would be very moved by that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would a book like this have meant to you when you were growing up? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It would have meant the world to me. I did not think this was anybody's experience except my own.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want people to take away from the book? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's a sentence in the book that says: "The strongest heart is the one that's still beating." Even at your lowest point, the job of the heart is to make sure all your organs are getting blood so your body survives. You don't have to be amazing all the time. Sometimes there are low points, and even if you're just surviving, that's a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
