			&lt;p&gt;Research on the microbes living in our digestive tract has triggered a '&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503711/"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;' in nutritional science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, dietary fiber has become the "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;new protein&lt;/a&gt;", added to foods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;in abundance&lt;/a&gt; to feed our gut's microbiome and boost our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a study on mice published in 2024 suggests that not all fiber supplements are equally beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-fiber-could-protect-you-from-infections-heres-why"&gt;Eating Fiber Could Protect You From Infections. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A form that is readily found in oats and barley, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat_beta-glucan"&gt;beta-glucan&lt;/a&gt;, can control blood sugar and assist in weight loss among mice fed a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Arizona (UA) and the University of Vienna found it decreased a mouse's fat content and body weight within 18 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other fibers they tested, including wheat dextrin, pectin, resistant starch, and cellulose, had no such effect, despite shifting the makeup of the mouse microbiome significantly compared to mice fed no fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that fiber is important and beneficial; the problem is that there are so many different types," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Frank Duca from UA in July last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to know what kind of fiber would be most beneficial for weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis so that we can inform the community, the consumer, and then also inform the agricultural industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibers are the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/interactions-between-dietary-fibre-and-the-gut-microbiota/0BEF28B809F38D02AC0B1D4E4990210C"&gt;main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for bacteria living in our guts, and &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/health-benefits-dietary-fibers-vary"&gt;yet less than 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people in the US consume the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/increasing-fiber-intake"&gt;recommended 25–30 grams (0.9–1 ounce)&lt;/a&gt; of fiber a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg" alt="A bowl of oats and some oat grains " class="size-full wp-image-133570" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OatsAndABowl-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133570" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Beta-glucan is found in oats and barley. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADat1fdGi4/"&gt;ArxOnt/Canva Pro&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, fiber supplements and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-create-invisible-fiber-that-can-make-cakes-and-pizzas-better-for-you"&gt;'invisible fiber'-infused foods&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/inulin-is-being-added-to-many-foods-but-it-could-be-causing-stomach-problems"&gt;growing in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. But fibers are extremely diverse, so which do we choose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fibers, like oat beta-glucans and wheat dextrin, are water-&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/compare-dietary-fibers"&gt;soluble&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are easily fermented by gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, like cellulose and resistant starch, are less soluble or insoluble, meaning they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/whats-the-difference-between-soluble-and-insoluble-fiber"&gt;stick to other materials to form stool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Elizabeth Howard from UA and her colleagues, "there is no study that has investigated the role of various fibers in one cohort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for this, the current study tested several forms of fiber in one cohort of mice. Only beta-glucan was found to increase the number of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ileibacterium"&gt;Ileibacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in the mouse intestine. Other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy011"&gt;studies on mice&lt;/a&gt; have linked this bacterium to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, long before the 10-week marker, mice fed beta-glucan showed reduced body weight and body fat content compared to mice fed other forms of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with another recent &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-023-00767-8"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Duca, which fed barley flour, rich in beta-glucan, to rodents. Even though the rats continued eating just as much of their high-fat diet as before, their energy expenditure increased and they lost weight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar outcome was observed in mice fed beta-glucan in the new study. These animals also showed increased concentrations of butyrate in their guts, which is a metabolite made when microbes break down fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butyrate induces the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is the natural protein that synthetic drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ozempic-and-why-are-people-saying-its-a-sad-way-to-lose-weight"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; mimic to stimulate insulin release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_124692" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg" alt="Fingers Hold Ozempic Pen" class="size-medium wp-image-124692" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/FingersHoldOzempicPen.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-124692" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs mimic the effects of GLP-1. (imyskin/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the benefits of consuming dietary fiber is through the release of GLP-1 and other gut peptides that regulate appetite and body weight," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/how-your-morning-oats-could-help-you-manage-your-weight"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Duca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we don't think that's all of the effect. We think that there are other beneficial things that butyrate could be doing that are not gut peptide related, such as improving gut barrier health and targeting peripheral organs like the liver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed before these results can be extended to humans, but the findings suggest that some fibers may be better suited to weight loss and insulin control than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2024.05.003"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 causes of death in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Early data on deaths in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr039.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;published by&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, show that COVID dropped from the list for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It became the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm" target="_blank"&gt;third leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2020, and remained among the leading causes until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"COVID is still in the top 15 leading causes of death, so it hasn't disappeared," says Farida Ahmad, a health scientist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and lead author on the publication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db456.htm" target="_blank"&gt;peak in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, when more than 463,000 people died from COVID, it has been moving steadily down the list. Last year, it was a factor in around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;47,000&lt;/a&gt; U.S. deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Overall, deaths last year were down 4% from the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of that downward trend, Ahmad says. The declines extend across the board, to most age groups and to people of all races and ethnicities, and can be attributed to a number of factors, such as fewer deaths from COVID and from drug overdoses, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The leading causes of death included suicide, diabetes, kidney disease, and unintentional injury. Heart disease and cancer — both chronic diseases — remained the top two leading causes of death, as they have been for more than a decade, and were responsible for more than 40% of U.S. deaths in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Death rates were higher for men than women, for older adults, and for Black Americans compared with other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fact that we're seeing people living into older and older age and dying of chronic diseases is a sign that we've been successful at dealing with infectious diseases," says Kathleen Ethier, a former CDC official at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt;, who left the agency in January and was not involved in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Tackling chronic diseases takes a different strategy, Ethier says: "These are things that develop over time, that are highly impacted by our behavior and environments and genetics."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With heart disease, for instance, a person may have higher risks if they have a family history of the condition, if they live in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323613" target="_blank"&gt;stressful or polluted environments&lt;/a&gt;, if they mainly eat &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and if they have spotty access to health care. "What kinds of food can people afford? Do they have insurance and money to pay for services? Those are difficult, entrenched things for public health to impact," Ethier says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a report titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," which &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5534412/rfk-maha-report-childrens-health" target="_blank"&gt;drew mixed reviews&lt;/a&gt; from public health advocates, who note that its goals clash with other recent moves by the Trump Administration, including cuts to food assistance, scientific research, Medicaid programs and changes that limit access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What this administration is doing is going to make the top ten causes of death worse," says Ethier. She notes that President Trump's &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;FY 2026 budget&lt;/a&gt; targets the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC division&lt;/a&gt; that's focused on preventing chronic diseases for elimination in. This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press-releases/2025_05_05_administrations-budget-would-devastate-cdc-efforts-to-fight-chronic-disease-and-tobacco-use" target="_blank"&gt;office that deals with smoking&lt;/a&gt;, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and some cancers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — West Nile virus infections are intense so far this year, with case counts running 40% higher than normal, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 770 cases, including about 490 severe cases, were reported as of early September, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data posted this week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. About 550 cases — 350 of them severe — are usually reported by this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are ramping up warnings to the public, because most cases of the mosquito-borne disease are reported in August and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“West Nile virus can be a very serious disease and its presence in mosquitoes remains high right now in Massachusetts,” said the state’s public health commissioner, Dr. Robbie Goldstein, in a statement last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can protect themselves by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when possible, and using an EPA-registered &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/mosquito-repellent-cdc-recommends-e47c0c35ffe49d6f36b39d03f1b95e06"&gt;insect repellent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when spending time outdoors, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus was first reported in the United States in 1999 in New York, and then gradually spread across the country. It &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/historic-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;peaked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2003, when nearly 10,000 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists say many people — perhaps tens of thousands each year — are infected but don’t know it because they have no symptoms, or only mild ones such as headaches, body aches, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, damage to the central nervous system causes inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, health officials have fielded reports of 2,000 cases annually on average, including 1,200 life-threatening neurological illnesses and approximately 120 deaths. Deaths are on pace to be higher this year, CDC officials said, but they declined to discuss specifics, saying mortality statistics are too preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that there are more mosquitoes this year, but rather that a higher proportion of the bugs are carrying the virus, CDC officials said. Mosquito infection rates can be affected by such factors as temperature, rainfall, the amount of insect control going on, and how many nearby birds are infected.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Colorado, which tends to see more West Nile virus, has reported about 150 of the nation’s cases — more than double what other states are reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort Collins is a hot spot. Monitoring last month in an area in the southwest part of the city found that 35 out of every 1,000 female mosquitoes were infected — far higher than the 8 per 1,000 that would be expected for that time of year — said Roxanne Connelly, a CDC entomologist who lives there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear why, but she noted it’s been a wet and warm year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;The mortality rate in the United States declined by 3.8% in 2024, and COVID-19 was no longer among the 10 leading causes of death, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr039.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a federal report&lt;/a&gt; released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using provisional death certificate data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics estimates there were 3,072,039 deaths last year, which equates to about 722 deaths per 100,000 people compared to 750.5 per 100,000 in 2023. This is the lowest death rate since 2020, the authors of the report note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for the first time since 2020, COVID-19 was not one of the 10 leading causes of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top three causes of death were heart disease with 683,037 deaths, cancer with 619,812 and unintentional injury with 196,488. The other leading causes were stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall death rate decline, deaths for both heart disease and cancer, the two leading causes, increased from 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken down by demographics, death rates were highest for males, older adults and Black people, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are limited due to the use of provisional data, but the estimates still give "researchers and policymakers an early signal about shifts in mortality trends," the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heart-disease-risk-factors/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a survey from the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; earlier this year found many Americans are unaware of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch-out-for-these-top-heart-disease-risk-factors/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, including things like tobacco use and air pollution. And the risk doesn't appear to be slowing anytime soon — &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/61-percent-us-adults-cardiovascular-disease-2050-american-heart-association/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;a 2024 report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the American Heart Association projected more than six in 10 U.S. adults, about 61%, will have some type of cardiovascular disease by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

Those samples with median signal intensities of unmethylated and methylated channels of at least 10.5 in log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scale were considered as having good signal intensities. Subsequently, detection &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated across all CpGs and samples using the detectionP function for the unnormalized RGChannelSet object. Samples were considered as good if having a mean detection &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value across all CpGs of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.01. On a CpG level, we retained CpGs with a detection &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt; in 90% or more of the samples, which has been shown to improve the quality of downstream analyses&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Lehne, B. et al.

The RGChannelSet object was normalized with the single-sample batch-independent preprocessNoob function with dye bias correction.

Further analyses using long-read nanopore data, Illumina array control probes, annotation packages and a data-driven approach were used to ensure the lack of any genetic confounding in the methylation values of the resulting fCpGs (see the next sections).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, CpGs with any previous evidence of potential cross-hybridization were excluded&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 54" title="Chen, Y.

We first excluded the possibility that common germline SNPs caused methylation heterogeneity at fCpG sites between individuals. We observed very distinct methylation dynamics of array control probes containing SNPs (which had been removed during the initial array processing) versus fCpGs. SNP probes showed the same distribution in all samples (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;), including longitudinally followed cases (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), whereas fCpGs only showed a W distribution in cancer samples with ongoing fluctuations over time. Thus, although SNPs reflect the stable genetic identity of the individual, fCpGs reflect the identity of a single cell and its evolving lineage. In addition, we used the packages SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38 (v0.99.24) and MafH5.gnomAD.v4.0.GRCh38 (v3.19) to check for any known significant germline or somatic genetic confounding on the resulting 978 fCpGs. We found approximately 60% of fCpGs reported in the gnomAD v4 database (with the array background having approximately 65%), but with a very low MAF (median of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; and mean of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). To exclude the possibility of unknown or very rare genetic confounding, we used the data-driven gaphunting algorithm&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Andrews, S.

Finally, Oxford Nanopore long read of a subset of normal and neoplastic samples further validated that fCpGs represent de/methylated cytosines (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2d,e&lt;/a&gt;; see next section).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Generation and analyses of long-read nanopore data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long-read methylation sequencing in CLL and Richter transformation samples, concentration was assessed using the Qubit assay and DNA integrity was analysed either with the Femto Pulse System (Agilent) or the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent). When more than 6 µg of material with good integrity was available, DNA was additionally treated with the Short Fragment Eliminator Kit XS (PacBio) and eluted in EB buffer. Approximately 4 µg of DNA was used for library preparation according to the standard LSK114 kit and protocol from Oxford Nanopore. The time for DNA repair and end-prep was increased up to 30 min at 20 °C and 30 min at 65 °C. Adapter ligation was performed for 1 h at room temperature. All elutions were performed at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and 550–600 ng of DNA was loaded onto a FLO-PRO114M (CLL cells) flow cells. Flow cells were washed (EXP-WSH004) after 1–2 days, if pore count decreased to less than 30%. A total of 1–4 washes were performed for each flow cell. Flow cells were run for 100 (CLL cells) hours in total with the Fast model (MinKNOW 23.11.7, Dorado 7.2.13). The raw data were rebasecalled using dorado duplex (v0.5.3) and applying the SUP and modified call to detect 5mC and 5hmC, (model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.3.0_5mCG_5hmCG@v1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal B cell samples, 1–3 µg of DNA was used for WGS. Libraries were prepared with the DNA ligation kit LSK110 with no modifications. Libraries were loaded onto a flow cell version FLO-PRO002 (R9.4) and were run for 90–110 h. The basecalling was performed on live mode with the Guppy basecaller (v6.2.7), included in the MinKNOW (v22.08.6), using the SUP model for base modification detection of 5mC and 5hmC (dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_sup.cfg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all samples, the generated unmapped BAM files after the basecalling were converted to FASTQ files using the SAMtools fastq -T Mm, Ml command. The FASTQ files were then mapped to BAM files using the command minimap2 -ax map-ont -y../GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.mmi. The methylation values were extracted from the BAMs into bedMethyl files using the in-house tool bam2bedmethyl (v0.3.2) and compressed/indexed using bgzip/tabix. Reads from each strand were combined to generate DNA matrices for each CpG and were used for obtaining the methylation values of all fCpGs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, mini BAM files containing all reads from the 976 fCpGs were generated (in hg38 genome assembly). The reads showed excellent mappability, with a mean of perfect nucleotide matches (NM tag; Levenshtein distance) for all fCpGs across samples of 96.41% (range of 73.31–97.90), and mean mapping quality (MAPQ) of all the reads covering all fCpGs across samples of 59.510 (range of 2–60). Subsequently, long reads were phased using variants called using Clair 3 (v1.0.9, model r941_prom_hac_g360 + g422)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Zheng, Z. et al.

The methylation status of each CpG was called using the modcall function within the Longphase package. At fCpGs, only 2.7% of the reads were non-canonical bases (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2d&lt;/a&gt;). The variant allele frequency (VAF) of these mutations tended to be low and was negatively correlated with the coverage at that site (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;). Hence, the majority of these non-canonical base pairs are probably due to errors in nucleotide assignment. There is also no association between the methylation status of different reads and the variants present within a 50-bp window of each fCpG locus (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;). Hence, assessment of fCpG methylation via bead array was not majorly confounded by miscalled variants. The fCpG methylation patterns seen in the bead array data were replicated in the long-read data (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;) and the correlation between the fraction methylated measured via bead array and long-read sequencing at fCpGs was excellent (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;). The same correspondence was observed in WGBS data (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2f&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the intra-sample long-read diversity for each sample, the pairwise Hamming distances were calculated between every read on both haplotypes. The two lists of Hamming distances were concatenated, and the mean calculated as a summary statistic of the read diversity for each sample. One normal B cell sample contained only two reads from one haplotype, and zero from the other, and so was excluded from further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Analysis of scRRBS data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously published single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS) data were obtained&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 6" title="Gaiti, F. et al.

There was a high dropout rate, so to extract meaningful patterns we plotted a subset of 40 cells and 20 fCpGs with a high density and overlap of fCpGs across single cells as examples (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;5a,b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare the full set of data accounting for the high degree of missing data, we used a metric of heterogeneity at a given fCpG that weights by the number of non-missing fCpGs according to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equa" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${d}_{i}=\sqrt{\frac{{n}_{i}({n}_{i}-1)}{2}}\sigma ({\beta }_{i})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of non-NaN values for the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;th fCpG, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the total possible pairwise comparisons between a set of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; objects and &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) is the standard deviation across the methylation values of the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;th fCpG (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;5c&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Characterization and annotation of fCpGs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To characterize the genomic and regulatory context of fCpGs, we used a series of statistical analyses and database annotations. We annotated fCpGs using Illumina manifest and other genomic annotation packages available at Bioconductor including IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19 (v0.6.1) and IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b2.hg19 (v0.6.0). We additionally used the packages SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP155.GRCh38 (v0.99.24) and MafH5.gnomAD.v4.0.GRCh38 (v3.19) to check any possible germline or somatic genetic confounding on the resulting 978 fCpGs.

In addition, we used the Illumina 450k and EPIC array internal SNP probes and showed a dramatically distinct methylation dynamics compared with fCpGs in single-timepoint (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#Fig7"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;) and longitudinal (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) samples.

Initially, our model focused on neutral evolution, before expanding to non-neutral modes of tumour evolution below. For the full explanation of the model, see the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09374-4#MOESM1"&gt;Supplementary Information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model was parameterized in terms of the age of the patient at which the MRCA emerged (&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;), the exponential growth rate of the cancer (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;) and the epigenetic switching rates of the fCpGs (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;). The model was partitioned into two phases: before and after the emergence of the MRCA.

We assumed that the initial cancer population began exponentially growing at &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as above, but at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we selected a single cell with a set of fCpG states drawn according to the cancer population and allowed this second population to grow concurrently with a growth rate &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent-cancer model followed the same scheme as the nested subclonal selection model, except the methylation status of the emerging cancer was that of an independent cell that experienced random fluctuations between &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 0 and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we let the number of cells in the less fit subclone in each methylation state be {&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;} and in the fitter subclone be {&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, following the convention above, then in both cases the measured methylation patterns at the time of sample are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equc" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{c}(T)=\frac{{k}_{1}(T)+2{m}_{1}(T)+{k}_{2}(T)+2{m}_{2}(T)}{2{N}_{e}(T)}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({N}_{e}(T)={e}^{{\theta }_{1}(T-{\tau }_{1})}+{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(T-{\tau }_{2})}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Adaption of simulations to a longitudinal setting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We modified the simulations of how the fCpG methylation distribution changes over time to allow for multiple sequential sample collections. These simulations allow for neutral, independent clones, a single subclonal expansion or two subclonal expansions, which can either be nested or emerge from the clonal trunk in parallel. This required pre-specification of sampling times, along with the emergence times of any subclones or independent clones, which we collected to form a set of ‘landmark times’. The discrete time steps of the simulation were split into phases between the landmark times, which evolved according to the discrete time Markov process outlined above. At each sampling time, the fCpG methylation fraction was calculated as above and stored as a column in the output matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Prior functions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each methylation array blood sample, we had matched age (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) and purity (&lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;) information. Hence, the parameters to be inferred are the growth rate (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;), the age of the patient when the MRCA emerged (&lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;), the epigenetic switching rates (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;), the average fraction methylated of contaminating normal cells (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;), the β-offsets from 0 and 1 due to the background noise on the methylation array (&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt;, respectively) and the precision of the β-distributed noise (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These parameters are constrained either to be positive (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;μ, ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0) or to lie within a specified range (0 &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;τ/T&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ε&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 1), which we achieved using appropriate prior distributions. To better allow for priors to be set on a biologically meaningful scale, the priors for the log-normal distribution were set in terms of the real scale mean and standard deviation, rather than the standard log-scale. To reduce correlations in the posterior and make sampling more efficient, the variables &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt; were normalized by &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The priors are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equd" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\theta  \sim {\rm{lognormal}}(\mathrm{3,2})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Eque" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\tau }{T} \sim {\rm{beta}}(2,2)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equf" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mu  \sim {\rm{halfnormal}}(0,0.05)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equg" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\gamma  \sim {\rm{halfnormal}}(0,0.05)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equh" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\upsilon }{\mu } \sim {\rm{lognormal}}(1,0.7)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equi" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\frac{\zeta }{\gamma } \sim {\rm{lognormal}}(1,0.7)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equj" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{n} \sim {\rm{beta}}(2,2)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equk" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\delta  \sim {\rm{beta}}(5,95)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equl" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\epsilon } \sim {\rm{beta}}(95,5)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Equm" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\kappa  \sim {\rm{halfnormal}}(100,30)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fitting non-neutral models of tumour growth, the inference was parameterized in terms of the relative growth of the fitter subclone, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\tilde{\theta }}_{2}=\frac{{\theta }_{2}}{{\theta }_{1}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the fraction of the population consisting of the fitter subclone, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(f=\frac{{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(t-{\tau }_{2})}}{{e}^{{\theta }_{1}(t-{\tau }_{1})}+{e}^{{\theta }_{2}(t-{\tau }_{2})}}\)&lt;/span&gt;.

Chains were run and ESS values assessed as described above. The distances between the ancestral state of the root at each MCMC state and the clock rate were used to calculate the expected evolution distance between the root and the known germline. This was used to inform the length of the branch between germline (at birth) and the MRCA of the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;Survival analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical analyses were performed in CLL for TTFT and overall survival from the time of sampling. Tumour growth rate (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;), effective population size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) and epigenetic switching rates were analysed as continuous variables in univariate Cox regression models for both TTFT and overall survival. The effect size of HRs for each evolutionary variable were analysed considering different scaling factors. In particular, the growth rate was analysed assuming exponential growth (that is, for &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; = 1, the population is &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; = 2.71 times bigger per year), the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; was considered per million cells, and the cancer age or time from the MRCA was analysed for each 10 years. Individual switching rate parameters (&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ν&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ζ&lt;/i&gt;) were largely uninformative of prognosis and were summarized into a mean epigenetic switching rate, which was scaled by a factor of 100. In addition, growth rate and effective population were analysed as continuous variables in multivariate Cox regression models together with &lt;i&gt;TP53&lt;/i&gt; aberrations (considering mutations and deletions together), IGHV gene mutational status and the age of patients at sampling. Kaplan–Meier curves were generated for low and high growth rates and effective population size within IGHV subtypes using maximally selected log-rank statistic using the maxstats package (v0.7-25). &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values from Kaplan–Meier curves were derived using the log-rank statistic. Survival (v3.5-7), survminer (v0.4.9) and ggsurvfit (v0.3.1) packages were used under R (v4.3.1). Plots were generated using ggplot2 (v3.5.2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Estimating the rate of change in lymphocyte counts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historical records of the absolute number of lymphocytes in blood obtained via haemocytometer were collected for patients with CLL over the whole disease course (that is, an approximate of the number of malignant CLL cells in blood).

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is warning people of a deadly bug that can be found in Arkansas and other states.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insect is known scientifically as Triatominae and commonly by its nickname the "kissing bug." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insect has the ability to transmit Chagas disease. an illness that is primarily found in the rural areas of Mexico, Central America and South America. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Chagas disease has been reported in 32 states and out of those states, eight states have reported human cases. Those states are as follows: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC has said that roughly 8 million globally have the disease, which includes roughly 280,000 in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials with the CDC said that many times people are unaware that they even know they have the illness, but that if the illness is left untreated it can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about the disease and the insect:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does the "kissing bug" look like? &lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kissing bug is primarily known for its distinctive orange-red to yellowish markings on its body and wings. According to the CDC, here's a look at the key characteristics for the insect: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orange-red to yellowish horizontal markings covering less than one-fourth of abdominal segment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouthparts relatively hairless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pronotum black with orange-red to yellowish side and top margins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tip of scutellum long, narrow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinctive orange-red to yellowish markings on wings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is Chagas disease spread?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, Chagas disease is caused by a parasite named Trypanosoma cruzi — this parasite is usually spread through contact with the "kissing bugs." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals shared that the kissing bugs bite and suck blood animals and people who are infected, which causes the insects to then become infected with the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After biting, the bugs poop, and the poop has the parasite within it. From there, if the insect's poop gets in someone's body either through a cut, eyes, or mouth, it can lead to an infection. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC officials said that people could subconsciously rub the feces into a cut, eyes, or mouth without even knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="isPasted"&gt;Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals said that shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Romaña's sign may appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others impacted by the disease may experience symptoms for years or a lifetime — health officials said that is known as the "chronic phase of infection," and can include heart and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="isPasted"&gt;Avoiding the "kissing bugs"&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, health officials emphasized that it's important to protect yourself through preventative measures. Here's a look at prevention measures you can take: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying in well-built places if traveling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using insecticides and bug spray&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing clothes that cover your skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not eating raw fruits and vegetable (the infection can be acquired orally or via contaminated food).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is warning people of a deadly bug that can be found in Arkansas and other states.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDC officials said that people could subconsciously rub the feces into a cut, eyes, or mouth without even knowing it. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="isPasted"&gt;Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health professionals said that shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Romaña's sign may appear.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others impacted by the disease may experience symptoms for years or a lifetime — health officials said that is known as the "chronic phase of infection," and can include heart and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="isPasted"&gt;Avoiding the "kissing bugs"&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, health officials emphasized that it's important to protect yourself through preventative measures. Here's a look at prevention measures you can take: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying in well-built places when traveling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using insecticides and bug spray&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing clothes that cover your skin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not eating raw fruits and vegetables (the infection can be acquired orally or via contaminated food).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deadly malady known as “kissing bug” disease is now an endemic illness in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation is seeing a rise in the illness, which is officially known as Chagas disease.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be life-threatening and is transmitted through “kissing bugs” that bite human faces, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/09/kissing-bug-disease-chagas-endemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Washington Post reported&lt;/a&gt;. Pets can carry the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disease is considered endemic when it is constantly present within a specific area or population.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million people worldwide are considered at risk of being infected with Chagas disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)#:~:text=development%20of%20information%2C%20education%20and,up%2C%20and%20notification%20of%20cases." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;World Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)#:~:text=development%20of%20information%2C%20education%20and,up%2C%20and%20notification%20of%20cases." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Organization&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “kissing bug” itself is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is found in the feces of the triatomine bug — commonly known as the “kissing bug” because it often bites people’s faces, the Post said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects can become infected when they feed on the blood of hosts carrying the parasite.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals can become infected in a few ways, according to the Post:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When contaminated feces are accidentally rubbed into open wounds, the eyes or the mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From pregnant mother to child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through contaminated blood transfusions (but this is rarer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are one of the animals that can host the parasite, and there has been growing evidence of canine infections in states including Texas and California.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least eight states where cases of Chagas disease have been identified: California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kissing bugs themselves “occur naturally in the southern half of the country and have been identified in 32 states,” according to the CDC, the Post said. They’re often found in rural parts of Mexico, Central America and South America.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;No vaccines&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t any vaccines or drugs right now to prevent Chagas disease, the CDC said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the U.S., two anti-parasitic medicines have been approved for those who are suspected to have been infected, the Post said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitigation tactics include:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spraying areas with long-lasting insecticides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wearing clothing that covers the skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding raw vegetables and unpeeled fruits in areas where Chagas disease has been detected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners can help prevent Chagas disease by using anti-flea and tick medications such as Nexgard and Bravecto.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When traveling in areas where the insects are present, the CDC recommended reducing the risk of contact with infected kissing bugs, which are “sometimes found in the cracks and crevices of poorly constructed houses and can survive both indoors and outdoors,” according to the Post.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two phases of Chagas disease — acute and chronic — with the former potentially being asymptomatic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acute phase happens in the first few weeks or months after infection. It can cause mild symptoms like fever, fatigue, body aches or swelling of the eyelid.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should seek treatment at this stage, the CDC advised, according to the Post.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, the chronic disease can develop, lasting for several years or even a lifetime.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 30% can develop serious health complications — leading to conditions like heart failure or an enlarged esophagus or colon, according to the CDC. Others may remain asymptomatic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is “often fatal by the time symptoms develop,” Paula Stigler Granados, an associate professor at the San Diego State University School of Public Health, told the Post.

&lt;/p&gt;

Advice flips, trends flare up, and people are left unsure about what actually supports the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A careful look at spicy food offers a clear signal worth your attention. A new population analysis from Sichuan Province, China, tracked adults and linked frequent chili intake to lower rates of major heart and brain events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spicy-food-and-heart-health"&gt;Spicy food and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/706473/bio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marialaura Bonaccio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.reteneuroscienze.it/en/Istituto/irccs-istituto-neurologico-mediterraneo-neuromed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IRCCS&lt;/a&gt; Neuromed has spent years studying chili peppers and heart outcomes in Europe, and her work helps frame this topic globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her perspective complements findings from China while reminding us to keep lifestyle and culture in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese team analyzed 54,859 adults and found that compared with people who rarely ate spicy food, those who ate it 6 to 7 days per week were less likely to develop ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also saw a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, a blockage in brain blood flow, with the likelihood of these problems dropping further as spicy food consumption became more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spicy-foods-can-slow-down-eating-and-cut-calorie-intake/"&gt;Moderate spice&lt;/a&gt; intensity tracked with a lower overall risk of cardio and cerebrovascular disease in the cohort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting regular spicy intake earlier in life also lined up with lower risk, although the effect did not extend to hemorrhagic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-food-gets-spicy"&gt;How food gets spicy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main bioactive in chilies is &lt;a href="https://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/capgen.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;capsaicin&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for the burning sensation people feel when eating spicy foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond taste, capsaicin works on a special sensor in the body, found in nerves and in the lining of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this sensor is stimulated regularly, research in animals shows that it can increase the natural production of nitric oxide, a chemical that relaxes blood vessels and helps blood flow more smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process has also been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, especially in animals with hypertension, which is long term high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-capsaicin-and-arteries"&gt;Capsaicin and arteries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes are important because they improve the overall health of the inner walls of arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong, flexible arteries are better able to expand and contract, which reduces the workload on the heart and lowers the chance of damage over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better vessel relaxation means the circulatory system can adjust more easily when the body needs more blood flow, such as during exercise or stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capsaicin’s impact is not just about the immediate burning feeling on the tongue. Inside the body, it sets off chemical signals that affect how cells behave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, researchers have measured changes in proteins connected to nitric oxide pathways, and these shifts line up with long term improvements in how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-blood-vessels-may-fuel-the-spread-of-cancer-cells/"&gt;blood vessels function&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that eating spicy foods regularly may provide benefits for cardiovascular health that go well beyond flavor or temporary sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-this-fits-with-past-evidence"&gt;How this fits with past evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large-scale work in China from 2004 to 2013 linked frequent spicy eating to lower all cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26242395/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt; participants who ate spicy food 6 or 7 days per week had a 14 percent lower risk of death than those who ate it less than once a week, with inverse associations also seen for ischemic heart disease and respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate Italian &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31856971/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cohort&lt;/a&gt; found that people who ate chili peppers more than four times per week had lower total and cardiovascular mortality. The association persisted even when researchers accounted for adherence to the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings from the Italian study showed that chili pepper consumption appeared to offer protection for the heart even when overall eating habits differed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit was seen both in people who followed a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mediterranean-diet-boosts-brain-power-by-altering-the-gut/"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and in those whose diets were less healthy, suggesting that the positive effect of chili peppers was consistent across different dietary patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marialaura Bonaccio, who also led this study, underscored this point when presenting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-spicy-food-means-in-real-life"&gt;What spicy food means in real life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these studies say &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mild-chili-peppers-may-be-the-anti-spice-weve-been-looking-for/"&gt;chili peppers&lt;/a&gt; cure heart disease. They do say that in large groups of people, more frequent spicy intake is linked to fewer heart and brain problems across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is observational research, so cause and effect remain open questions. Still, the consistency across settings argues that spicy eating patterns often travel with other helpful choices or may deliver direct biological benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spice strength matters too. The Chinese work reported signals at weak to moderate levels, which gels with the simple idea that daily habits beat extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole chilies, simple sauces, and meals that use chili to season real food are sensible places to start. People with reflux, ulcers, or other conditions should adjust to tolerance and talk to a clinician if symptoms flare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Limits and what comes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A much larger China Kadoorie Biobank incidence&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12273639/"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;followed 486,335 adults for a median of 12.1 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found lower risks of vascular disease in people who ate spicy foods one to seven days per week, with trends that held for ischemic heart disease and major coronary events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was particularly clear in younger adults and those living in rural regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that people who enjoy spicy foods eat differently in other ways, or live in places where chili use reflects cultural patterns that bring other benefits or risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful sensitivity checks, such as excluding early events, help probe these points but do not close the book on causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could test how foods high in capsaicin or standardized chili products influence blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood vessel health over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers could also examine how chili affects nitric oxide activity in people by using amounts similar to those found in everyday cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cutting-through-the-noise"&gt;Cutting through the noise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition debates can feel noisy, yet some messages are steady. Frequent &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-chili-during-pregnancy-may-actually-be-a-good-idea/"&gt;chili&lt;/a&gt; use, inside a balanced pattern of eating, shows a consistent association with better heart and brain outcomes across very different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People do not need to chase extreme heat or complicated protocols. A modest, regular habit built around meals you enjoy is easier to keep, and the data suggest that rhythm matters more than bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taste and tolerance vary, so personal comfort should lead the way. If spicy foods agree with you, using chilies to season home cooked meals looks like a choice with upside and little downside for most healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40677177/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zh&lt;/em&gt;i&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 17:56:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOWkc1VUNKXzhlQVRrd2M2VEMzYzhydF9UNXBJVHY4bWtIaF9fRE80WDNEd3MtZmlGVVdOODJYVENUOVY5dml4ajRQcXJ3TlhtbGtQbTJZa2o0eURGQlpLSi1GekIwVWxrQ2JSd3djTjlpVEQySFFfWjVpbEIzaHVxUGdKX0JlZkc0SmhnanFHLTZYZw</guid></item><item><title>为什么越来越多的老年人在跌倒后死亡？ - Yahoo News Canada</title><link>https://ca.news.yahoo.com/why-more-older-people-dying-173446408.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For a while, walking the dog felt hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Earl Vickers was accustomed to taking Molly, his shepherd-boxer-something-else mix, for strolls on the beach or around his neighborhood in Seaside, Calif. A few years ago, though, he started to experience problems staying upright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If another dog came toward us, every single time I’d end up on the ground,” recalled Mr. Vickers, 69, a retired electrical engineer. “It seemed like I was falling every other month. It was kind of crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most of those tumbles did no serious damage, though one time he fell backward and hit his head on a wall behind him. “I don’t think I had a concussion, but it’s not something I want to do every day,” Mr. Vickers said, ruefully. Another time, trying to break a fall, he broke two bones in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So in 2022, he told the oncologist who had been treating him for prostate cancer that he wanted to stop the cancer drug he had been taking, off and on, for four years: enzalutamide (sold as Xtandi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Among the drug’s &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/203415lbl.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:listed side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;listed side effects&lt;/a&gt; are higher rates of falls and fractures among patients who took it, compared with those given a placebo. His doctor agreed that he could discontinue the drug, and “I haven’t had a single fall since,” Mr. Vickers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Public health experts have warned of the perils of falls for older people for decades. In 2023, the most recent year of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 41,000 Americans over 65 died from falls, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2837039" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an opinion article in JAMA Health Forum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;an opinion article in JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt; pointed out last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More startling than that figure, though, was another statistic: Fall-related mortality among older adults has been climbing sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The author, Dr. Thomas Farley, an epidemiologist, reported that death rates from fall injuries among Americans over 65 had more than tripled over the past 30 years. Among those over 85, the cohort at highest risk, death rates from falls jumped to 339 per 100,000 in 2023, from 92 per 100,000 in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The culprit, in his view, is Americans’ reliance on prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="mb-4 border-l-2 pl-5 italic text-tertiary"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Older adults are heavily medicated, increasingly so, and with drugs that are inappropriate for older people,” Dr. Farley said in an interview. “This didn’t occur &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31831549/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in Japan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in Japan&lt;/a&gt; or in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yet that same 30-year period saw a flurry of research and activity to try to reduce geriatric falls and their potentially devastating consequences, from hip fractures and brain bleeds to restricted mobility, persistent pain and institutionalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Geriatrics Society adopted updated &lt;a href="https://geriatrictoolkit.missouri.edu/balance/AGS-BGS-CPG-Fall-Prevention-JAGS-2011.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fall prevention guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fall prevention guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in 2011.

Geriatricians and others who research falls and prescribing practices question that conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Farley, a former New York City health commissioner who teaches at Tulane University, acknowledged that many factors contribute to falls, including the physical impairments and deteriorating eyesight associated with advancing age; alcohol abuse; and tripping hazards in people’s homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But “there’s no reason to think any of them have gotten three times worse in the past 30 years,” he said, pointing to studies showing &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(24)00198-3/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declines in other high-income countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;declines in other high-income countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference, he believes, is Americans’ increasing use of medications — like benzodiazepines, opioids, antidepressants, and gabapentin — that act on the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The drugs that increase falls’ mortality are those that make you drowsy or dizzy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Problematic drugs are numerous enough to have acquired an acronym: FRIDs, or “fall risk increasing drugs,” a category that also includes various cardiac medications and early antihistamines like Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Such medications play a major role, agreed Dr. Thomas Gill, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at Yale University and a longtime falls researcher. But, he said, “there are alternative explanations” for the increase in death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He cited changes in reporting the causes of death, for instance. “Years ago, falls were considered a natural consequence of aging and no big deal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Death certificates often attributed fatalities among older people to ailments like heart failure instead of falls, making fall mortality appear lower in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today’s over-85 cohort may also be frailer and sicker than the oldest-old were 30 years ago, Dr. Gill added, because contemporary medicine can keep people alive for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their accumulating impairments, more than the drugs they take, could make them more likely to die after a fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another skeptic, Dr. Neil Alexander, a geriatrician and falls expert at the University of Michigan and V.A. Ann Arbor Healthcare System, argued that most doctors have come to understand the dangers of FRIDs and prescribe them less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Message delivered,” he said. Given the alarms sounded about opioids, about benzodiazepines and related drugs, and especially about opioids and benzos together, “a lot of primary care doctors have heard the gospel,” he said. “They know not to give older people Valium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Moreover, prescriptions for some fall-related drugs have already declined or hit plateaus, even as death rates because of falls have risen. Medicare data shows &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-025-01237-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower prescription opioid use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lower prescription opioid use&lt;/a&gt; beginning a decade ago, for example.

A few years ago, though, he started to experience problems staying upright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If another dog came toward us, every single time I’d end up on the ground,” recalled Mr. Vickers, 69, a retired electrical engineer. “It seemed like I was falling every other month. It was kind of crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most of those tumbles did no serious damage, though one time he fell backward and hit his head on a wall behind him. “I don’t think I had a concussion, but it’s not something I want to do every day,” Mr. Vickers said, ruefully. Another time, trying to break a fall, he broke two bones in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So in 2022, he told the oncologist who had been treating him for prostate cancer that he wanted to stop the cancer drug he had been taking, off and on, for four years: enzalutamide (sold as Xtandi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Among the drug’s &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/203415lbl.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:listed side effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;listed side effects&lt;/a&gt; are higher rates of falls and fractures among patients who took it, compared with those given a placebo.

&lt;p&gt;The governor has issued executive actions that his office said would allow Connecticut residents who want COVID vaccines to be able to get them and “that coverage under state-regulated health insurance policies remains uninterrupted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes at a time when new federal guidance has raised questions about who will be eligible for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Gov. Ned Lamont issued executive actions on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His office said the state Department of Public Health is recommending that children 6 months and older receive the vaccine, as well as adults of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/health/covid-19-vaccine-complicated-process/3631179/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has OK’d new shots for adults 65 and older and younger adults who a health condition that makes them vulnerable to severe COVID-19.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” Lamont said in a statement. “Making vaccines accessible is grounded in health and safety, which is too important to leave to the whims of a political agenda. Vaccines have been proven for many decades to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death, and patients and their doctors should be able to decide what is the best course of treatment for themselves. We will not allow gridlock in Washington to put the people of our state at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Public Health has released interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season, which the governor said is similar to those issued in previous years, recommending that children 6 months and older receive the vaccine, as well as adults of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-documentcloud wp-block-embed-documentcloud"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We cannot predict which respiratory viral infection will be most prevalent this season, but we can protect our families against them and potential severe complications by getting vaccinated this fall,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Juthani said in a statement. “I am currently assembling an advisory committee to work with me on matters relating to recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal Food and Drug Administration using evidence-based data from peer-reviewed literature and studies. We are in the process of scheduling our first meeting for this month. I am looking forward to discussing with this group the ongoing changes at the federal level regarding vaccines and other public health recommendations to ensure that we continue to provide the best care and guidance to the people of Connecticut.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection is &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dcp/home/knowledge-base/articles/drug-control/pharmacy/covid-vaccine-guidance-update?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;providing pharmacists with guidance&lt;/a&gt; on distribution of vaccines and says pharmacists may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 days from issuance of DCP’s notice, or the vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While federal actions restrict eligibility for adults ages 18 to 65 with no underlying medical conditions, prescribers and pharmacists may order, prescribe, and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals who fall outside the eligibility criteria authorized by the FDA, consistent with “off-label” use,” according to the statement from the governor’s office.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here in Connecticut, pharmacists played a critical role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, and that will continue this fall as patients seek protection against the most current strains of the virus,” DCP Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said in a statement. “Pharmacists are trusted frontline healthcare workers who are often the first point of contact for patients seeking vaccination. While federal vaccine schedules are in flux, we have issued interim guidance to provide clarity and consistency for our pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Connecticut Insurance Department has issued a bulletin issued to all health insurers and health care centers in Connecticut that affirms that the state Department of Public Health interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season aligns with existing state law requiring immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued health insurance policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-provider-wordpress wp-block-embed-wordpress"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said, based the current guidance from the Department of Public Health and the medical academies, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies, regardless of the CDC’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This bulletin confirms that based on current DPH guidance, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies,” CID Commissioner Andrew Mais said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said pharmacists in Connecticut may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines to adults using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of 30 days from DCP’s notice or the vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists can also continue to vaccinate pursuant to a prescriber’s verbal or written prescription, and prescribers may order the vaccine consistent with FDA labeling and prevailing clinical recommendations. Vaccine supply and guidance for children will continue through the Connecticut Vaccine Program and medical homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said the administration is in frequent communication with public health officials from regional states in the Northeast to coordinate on a collaborative approach to these issues and the Lamont administration is researching potential legislative changes that might be needed within state statutes to “ensure continued stability in the future, regardless of any potential shifts in positions from the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(HARTFORD, CT) – In the face of recent actions within the federal government that have created uncertainty in the ability of Americans to access COVID-19 vaccines during the upcoming respiratory virus season, Governor Ned Lamont today announced a series of executive actions his administration is implementing to ensure that Connecticut residents who wish to be vaccinated continue to have access to these vaccines and that coverage under state-regulated health insurance policies remains uninterrupted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” &lt;strong&gt;Governor Lamont said&lt;/strong&gt;. “Making vaccines accessible is grounded in health and safety, which is too important to leave to the whims of a political agenda. Vaccines have been proven for many decades to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death, and patients and their doctors should be able to decide what is the best course of treatment for themselves. We will not allow gridlock in Washington to put the people of our state at risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lamont administration’s actions include a multi-pronged approach among several state agencies, notably the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH), the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection (DCP), and the Connecticut Insurance Department (CID).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DPH releases interim guidance on who should receive COVID vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the leadership of Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD, DPH today released interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season emphasizing that vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe COVID-19. The guidance is similar to those issued in previous years, recommending that children six months and older receive the vaccine, as well as adults of all ages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The guidance was developed based on evidence-based recommendations from professional and expert medical organizations such as the recently released guidance from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/AAP-Immunization-Schedule?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (AAP), &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (ACOG), and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (AAFP).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We cannot predict which respiratory viral infection will be most prevalent this season, but we can protect our families against them and potential severe complications by getting vaccinated this fall,” &lt;strong&gt;Commissioner Juthani said&lt;/strong&gt;. “I am currently assembling an advisory committee to work with me on matters relating to recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the federal Food and Drug Administration using evidence-based data from peer-reviewed literature and studies. We are in the process of scheduling our first meeting for this month. I am looking forward to discussing with this group the ongoing changes at the federal level regarding vaccines and other public health recommendations to ensure that we continue to provide the best care and guidance to the people of Connecticut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;DCP provides guidance on distribution of vaccines to pharmacists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To maintain seamless access while federal schedules are in flux, DCP today issued a guidance document to pharmacists, advising that – consistent with state law (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_400j.htm#sec_20-633"&gt;&lt;span&gt;C.G.S. § 20-633&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) – pharmacists may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;30 days from issuance of DCP’s notice, or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While federal actions restrict eligibility for adults ages 18 to 65 with no underlying medical conditions, prescribers and pharmacists may order, prescribe, and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals who fall outside the eligibility criteria authorized by the FDA, consistent with “off-label” use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Here in Connecticut, pharmacists played a critical role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, and that will continue this fall as patients seek protection against the most current strains of the virus,” &lt;strong&gt;DCP Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said&lt;/strong&gt;. “Pharmacists are trusted frontline healthcare workers who are often the first point of contact for patients seeking vaccination. While federal vaccine schedules are in flux, we have issued interim guidance to provide clarity and consistency for our pharmacists administering COVID-19 vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;CID issues bulletin on insurance coverage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bulletin issued today by CID to all health insurers and health care centers in Connecticut affirms that the DPH interim guidance for the 2025-2026 season aligns with existing state law requiring immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued health insurance policies. It also affirms that the DPH guidance is consistent with the COVID-19 immunization recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for which coverage is mandated by state law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based the current guidance from DPH and the medical academies, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies, regardless of the CDC’s position.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This bulletin confirms that based on current DPH guidance, there will be no change to existing COVID-19 immunization coverage in Connecticut-issued insurance policies,” &lt;strong&gt;CID Commissioner Andrew Mais said&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means for Connecticut residents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Combined, these actions will help address some restrictions created by the CDC to access to the COVID-19 vaccines in Connecticut. Adults of all ages can receive COVID-19 vaccinations at pharmacies and medical practices, and children between 6 months and 18 years can receive vaccinations through pediatric providers participating in the Connecticut Vaccine Program (CVP).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, these actions ensure that insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines based on current guidance from DPH, continues unchanged for state-regulated plans. For employers that offer self-funded (ERISA) plans, individuals should confirm their immunization benefits with their plan administrator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;What this means for Connecticut pharmacists and providers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following these actions, pharmacists in Connecticut may continue to order, prescribe, and administer FDA-approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines to adults using the most recent CDC administration instructions until the later of 30 days from DCP’s notice or the vaccine’s inclusion on the CDC Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, pharmacists may continue to vaccinate pursuant to a prescriber’s verbal or written prescription, and prescribers may order the vaccine consistent with FDA labeling and prevailing clinical recommendations. Vaccine supply and guidance for children will continue through the Connecticut Vaccine Program and medical homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next steps to bring stability amid uncertainty in the federal government&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking forward, Governor Lamont and officials within his administration continue to be in frequent communication with public health officials from regional states in the Northeast to coordinate on a collaborative approach to these issues. Additionally, the Lamont administration is researching potential legislative changes that may be needed within state statutes to ensure continued stability in the future, regardless of any potential shifts in positions from the federal government.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For information on how to be vaccinated in Connecticut, residents are encouraged to visit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.easyvax.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.easyvax.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or speak with their local pharmacy or medical provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Mice were housed according to the standard guidelines with free access to food and water in a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For brain tumour allograft experiments, NSG mice (NOD-SCID-IL2R gamma chain-deficient, the Jackson Laboratory) were used. Male and female mice were used equally. According to the IACUC guidelines, signs of morbidity rather than maximal tumour volume was used as indication for termination of brain allograft mouse experiments. Mice were euthanized if they exhibited signs of neurological disease or if they lost 15% or more of their body weight. For in vivo optogenetic stimulation of the premotor circuit (M2), &lt;i&gt;Thy1&lt;/i&gt;-ChR2; NSG or WT; NSG mice were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lung tumour experiments, mice were euthanized when they exhibited signs of sickness behaviour (such as dyspnea, abnormal gait or posturing, or ill-groomed fur) or lost &amp;gt;15% of body weight in accordance with IACUC guidelines.

The cranium was exposed via midline incision under aseptic conditions. 70,000 cells in 3 µl sterile HBSS were stereotactically injected into the M2 region of the cortex through a 31-gauge burr hole using a digital pump at an infusion rate of 0.4 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a 31-gauge Hamilton syringe. Stereotactic coordinates for &lt;i&gt;Thy1&lt;/i&gt;-ChR2 mouse allografts used were as follows: 0.5 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.5 mm deep to cortical surface. At the completion of infusion, the syringe needle was allowed to remain in place for a minimum of 2 min, then withdrawn at a rate of 0.875 mm min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to minimize backflow of the injected cell suspension.

These mice then received allografts of 16T-mGFP or xenografts of NCI-H446-GFP SCLC cells as described above at 0.8 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.2 mm deep relative to the cortical surface. Allografts of 16T-mGFP-ChR2 SCLC cells were performed following the procedure as above with exception for the following alterations: 15,000 cells were injected in 1 µl sterile HBSS 0.8 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −1.2 mm deep relative to cortical surface.

In brief, a fibre optic ferule was placed 1 week following or simultaneously with and ipsilateral to the SCLC allografts. After 1–2 weeks to allow for recovery from the procedure, the mice were connected to a 100-mW 473-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser system with a mono fibre patch cord, which freely permits wakeful behaviour of the mice. Pulses of light with approximately 4 mW measured output at tip of the patch cord were administered at a frequency of 20 Hz for periods of 30 s, followed by 90 s recovery periods, for a total session duration of 30 min. The mice were euthanized after 24 h post stimulation, and brains were collected for histological analysis. For stimulation of cortical interneurons in Dlx-ChRmine mice, 595-nm light was used at 40 Hz frequency and 10 ms width. Pulses of light with approximately 10 mW measured output at tip of the patch cord were administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For in vivo optogenetic depolarization of SCLC cells, ChR2–YFP (pLV-ef1-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP WPRE) construct (generated by the laboratory of K. Deisseroth and placed in the piggyback transposon system by M. Su in the laboratory of M.M.) was lentivirally transduced into 16T SCLC cells, which were then allografted into premotor cortex (M2) following the procedure described above. A fibre optic ferule was implanted during the same surgery ipsilateral to the cell injection site at following coordinates: 0.8 mm lateral to midline, 1.0 mm anterior to bregma, −0.9 mm deep relative to cortical surface. At 1 week post-allograft and for three consecutive days, all mice were connected to the laser system to receive blue light or mock stimulations at a frequency of 10 Hz for periods of 30 s, followed by 90 s recovery periods for a total session duration of 30 min.

Three weeks after engraftment, mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with Karnovsky’s fixative: 2% glutaraldehyde (EMS 16000) and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (EMS 15700) in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (EMS 12300), pH 7.4. The samples were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (EMS 19100) for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times with ultrafiltered water, then en bloc stained for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol (50%, 75% and 95%) for 15 min each at 4 °C; the samples were then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature and were rinsed in 100% ethanol 2 times, followed by acetonitrile for 15 min. Samples were infiltrated with EMbed-812 resin (EMS 14120) mixed 1:1 with acetonitrile for 2 h followed by 2:1 EMbed-812:acetonitrile for 2 h. The samples were then placed into EMbed-812 for 2 h, then placed into TAAB capsules filled with fresh resin, which were then placed into a 65 °C oven overnight. Sections were taken between 40 and 60 nm on a Leica Ultracut S (Leica) and mounted on 100-mesh Ni grids (EMS FCF100-Ni). For immunohistochemistry, microetching was done with 10% periodic acid and eluting of osmium with 10% sodium metaperiodate for 15 min at room temperature on parafilm. Grids were rinsed with water three times in between and followed by 0.5 M Glycine quench. Grids were incubated in blocking solution (0.5% BSA, 0.5% Ovalbumin in PBST) at room temperature for 20 min. Primary rabbit anti-GFP (1:300; MBL International) was diluted in the same blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day, grids were rinsed in PBS three times, and incubated in secondary antibody (1:10 10 nm Gold conjugated IgG TED Pella 15732) for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed with PBST followed by water. For each staining set, samples that did not contain any GFP-expressing cells were stained simultaneously to control for any non-specific binding. Grids were contrast stained for 30 s in 3.5% uranyl acetate in 50% acetone followed by staining in 0.2% lead citrate for 90 s. Samples were imaged in the tumour mass within the CA1 region of the hippocampus or within the contralateral normal hippocampus using a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV and images were collected using a Gatan Orius digital camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Electron microscopy data analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sections from the allografted hippocampi of mice were imaged as above using transmission electron microscopy. Here, 36 sections of 16T-mGFP across 6 mice were analysed. Electron microscopy images were taken at 6,000× with a field of view of 15.75 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Synapses were inspected by two individual investigators. SCLC cells were counted and analysed after unequivocal identification of immunogold particle labelling with four or more particles. For identification of synaptic structures, all three of the following criteria had to be clearly met: (1) visually apparent synaptic cleft; (2) presence of synaptic vesicle clusters in a cell on one side of the cleft; and (3) identification of clear post-synaptic density on the cell on opposite side of cleft. For identification of neuron-to-tumour synapses, the post-synaptic cell had to exhibit clear immunogold particle labelling. Tumour cells in perisynaptic positions were identified when an immunogold-particle-positive SCLC cell was seen apposed to or surrounding the synaptic structures between two other immunogold-particle-negative cells. Density of both types of synaptic relationships (neuron-to-tumour synapses, neuron-to-tumour perisynaptic connections) were quantified as the number of connections per number of SCLC cells identified within the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Histology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with intracranial tumour allografts were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal avertin (tribromoethanol), then transcardially perfused with 20 ml of ice-cold PBS. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura) and sectioned in the coronal plane at 40 μm using a sliding microtome. Lung tumour mice were perfused as above but also with 10 ml ice-cold 4% PFA. The lungs were inflated with 1–3 ml 2% UltraPure Low Melting Point Agarose (Invitrogen). Lungs and livers were fixed overnight at 4 °C on a shaker, then transferred to 70% ethanol and sectioned at 15 μm for H&amp;amp;E and immunohistochemistry, or cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and sectioned at 150 μm on a cryotome for visualizing tumour innervation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For immunofluorescence staining, the coronal sections were incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at room temperature for 45 min, followed by an overnight incubation with primary antibodies in antibody diluent solution (1% normal donkey serum in 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at 4 °C. On the next day, after a 5-min rinse in TBS, sections were incubated with DAPI (1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in TBS, Thermo Fisher) for 5 min, and rinsed again with TBS for 5 min. Afterwards, slices were incubated in secondary antibody solution at 4 °C overnight, then washed thrice in TBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Mounting medium (Life Technologies). All images were acquired with Zen 3.4 and analysed using Fiji ImageJ 2.1.0. For quantifying SCLC proliferation, average number of Ki67&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; SCLC cells divided by total number of SCLC cells labelled by GFP was calculated within regions of interest either in axon-rich/axon-poor areas of the tumour or in response to various optogenetic manipulations. For quantification of SCLC spread, average distance from the core was measured as longest distance from the initial site of injection to outer core of the tumour. For quantification of tumour invasion, average number of SCLC cells that migrated out of the circumscribed tumour edge over ~500 μm was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visualizing lung and liver tumour innervation with immunofluorescence, 150-μm-thick sections were processed as above, except primary antibody incubation time was extended to 72 h. Streptavidin Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Invitrogen) was used to visualized airway epithelium&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Scott, G.

For histological analyses, SCLC cells were added in the presence of 1 μM TTX (Tocris), 20 μM gabazine (Tocris) or vehicle. Co-cultures were then fixed and analysed 24 h later in the case of proliferation assays, and 5 days after co-culture in the case of synapse quantification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Induced neuron protocol medium&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;KSR medium: Knockout DMEM, 15% KOSR, 1× MEM-NEAA, 55 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 1× Glutamax (Life Technologies).

On day 17–18, neurons were replenished with a full medium change with or without the presence of 1 μM TTX. Conditioned medium was collected 24 h later for immediate use. Mouse 16T cells were then plated (30,000 cells in a 48 well plate) with 500 μL neuronal conditioned medium (again in the absence or presence of TTX) with the addition of 10 μM EdU to each well. After 24 h, cells were fixed cells with 4% PFA and stained using Click-iT 594 EdU kit and protocol (Invitrogen). All conditioned media assays were performed alongside direct co-culture assays described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;EdU incorporation assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;EdU staining was performed on glass coverslips in 24-well plates which were precoated with poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine (Sigma) and 5 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; mouse laminin (Thermo Fisher). Neurosphere cultures were dissociated with TrypLE and plated onto coated slides with 10 μM of EdU. After 24 h the cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min and then stained using the Click-iT 594 EdU kit and protocol (Invitrogen) with or without additional antibody staining and mounted using Prolong Gold mounting medium (Life Technologies). Proliferation index was determined by quantifying the fraction of EdU-labelled cells/GFP-labelled cells using confocal microscopy at 40× magnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Synaptic puncta staining and visualization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For immunohistochemistry, fixed coverslips were incubated in blocking solution (3% normal donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS) at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies guinea pig anti-synapsin1/2 (1:500; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-HOMER1 (1:500; Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-gephyrin (1:300, Cell Signaling Technologies), or mouse anti-neurofilament (1:500; Abcam) in 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C.

Coverslips were rinsed three times in TBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Mounting medium (Life Technologies). Images were collected using a 63× oil-immersion objective on a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope and processed with Airyscan.

For the initial week prior to co-culture, iNs were subjected to a half medium change every 3–4 days. Doxycycline and puromycin treatment were stopped after day 10 to allow for the addition of tumour cells. On day 14–15, SCLC cells were added at 30,000 cells per well MEA plates. MEA plates were recorded every day for 10 min for up to 2 weeks after co-culture.

Three weeks after allograft, brain slices were obtained using standard techniques. Mice were anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and perfused transcardially with ice-cold ACSF containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 2 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.25 NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 25 glucose (295 mOsm kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Brains were blocked and transferred into a slicing chamber containing ice-cold ACSF. Coronal slices of hippocampus were cut at 300-μm thickness with a Leica VT1000s vibratome in ice-cold ACSF, transferred for 10 min to a holding chamber containing choline-based solution consisting of (in mM) 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.5 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.25 NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 25 glucose, 11.6 ascorbic acid, and 3.1 pyruvic acid at 34 °C then transferred to a secondary holding chamber containing ACSF at 34 °C for 30 min and subsequently maintained at room temperature (20–22 °C) until use. All recordings were obtained within 5 h of slicing. Both choline solution and ACSF were constantly bubbled with 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual brain slices were transferred into a recording chamber, mounted on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51WI or Scientifica SliceScope Pro 1000) and continuously superfused (2–3 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) with ACSF and bubbled with 95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; warmed to 32–34 °C by passing it through a feedback-controlled in-line heater (SH-27B; Warner Instruments). Cells were visualized through 40× or 60× water immersion objectives with either infrared differential interference contrast optics or epifluorescence to identify GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. For whole-cell voltage clamp recording, patch pipettes (2–4 MΩ) pulled from borosilicate glass (Sutter Instruments) were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 135 CsMeSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 3.3 QX-314 (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; salt), 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 8 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH; 295 mOsm·kg−1). sEPSCs and spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) of GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were recorded for 5 min at –70 or 0 mV holding potential. For membrane current variance, 10 consecutive sweeps, each 10 s long, recorded in voltage clamp at −70 mV holding potential were analysed by calculating the s.d. of the current after applying a 3-point median filter. To record evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) and evoked inhibitory post-synaptic currents (eIPSCs), the membrane voltages were clamped at –70 mV or 0 mV. For perforated-patch recording eIPSCs (gramicidin D, 40–60 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) with access resistance 40–60 MΩ, variable holding membrane voltages were applied to generate an &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;–&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; curve and identify chloride’s equilibrium potential. Extracellular stimulation was performed with a stimulus isolation unit (MicroProbes, ISO-Flex), bipolar electrodes (75 μm apart, PlasticOne or MicroProbes) which were placed away 100–400 μm along the CA1–CA2 axis from the recorded cells. Stimuli were delivered at 10 s intervals with 0.1 ms duration and 100–200 μA amplitude. In some recordings, to confirm whether sEPSCs or eIPSCs were glutamatergic or GABAergic, 10 μM NBQX and CPP (Sigma) or 10 μM gabazine (Tocris) were added to bath ACSF. For perforated patched recordings, 10 μM NBQX and CPP were in bath continuously. Pyramidal cells in allografted and contralateral sites of hippocampus were recorded in whole-cell current clamp to study intrinsic properties. Patch pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 135 potassium methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 8 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH; 295 mOsm kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). From a resting potential of −70 mV, currents were injected for 1,000 ms at 50 pA steps from −100 to 1,000 pA. Intrinsic properties of hippocampus pyramidal cells were analysed with software in Matlab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracellular local field potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from hippocampal allograft and contralateral sites under current clamp (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; = 0 mode). A bipolar electrode (75 μm spacing, MicroProbes) was placed in stratum radiatum near the allograft or in the correspondent contralateral site. Recording glass electrodes (2–3 MΩ) filled ACSF were place 100–200 μm perpendicularly away from the stimulating bipolar electrode at a depth of 50 100 μm. The stimulation currents were delivered at 20 s intervals with 0.1 ms duration and variable intensities from 20 μA to 140 μA using 20 μA steps and repeated 10 times. The average slopes of fEPSPs for each current intensity were measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resting membrane potential of SCLC was assessed through cell-attached configuration (Rseal &amp;gt; 1 GΩ) using the procedure previously described in Antel et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 81" title="Antal, M., Acuna-Goycolea, C., Pressler, R.

Glass pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mM) 145 KCL, 2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). A voltage protocol consisting of hold at 0 mV, stepping to 100 mV and ramping back to −120 mV over 137.5 ms was applied to GFP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Five to ten consecutive traces were recorded and averaged. All data were acquired with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized at 3 kHz with a National Instruments data acquisition device (NI USB- 6343).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Calcium imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For calcium imaging, the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s was lentivirally transduced into mouse SCLC 16T (pLV-ef1-GCaMP6s-P2A-nls-tdTomato). In this case, SCLC cells containing the GCaMP6s reporter can be identified using the tdTomato nuclear tag. These cells were isolated and grafted into the CA1 region of the hippocampus as described above. Two-photon calcium imaging experiments were performed using Prairie Ultima XY upright two-photon microscope for tissue slices equipped with an Olympus LUM Plan FI W/IR-2 40× water immersion objective. The temperature of the perfusion medium, ACSF as described above, was kept at 30 °C, and perfused through the system at rate of 2 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Excitation light was provided at a wavelength of 920 nm through a tunable Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics Mai Tai DeepSee) to allow for excitation of both tdTomato and GCaMP6s. The actual laser power reaching the scanhead for each scope is dynamically controlled by Pockels cells via software interface. Pockels cell were set at 10 for all experiments, and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) were set at 800 for each channel. For these settings, power at back aperture of the objective was approximately 30 mW at 920 nm. The wavelength ranges for the emission filters were PMT1: 607 nm centre wavelength with 45 nm bandpass (full-width at half-maximum) and PMT2: 525-nm centre wavelength with 70-nm bandpass (full-width at half-maximum). Recordings were made at 0.65 frames per second (~1.5 Hz) for about 30 min in the case of spontaneous activity and 10 min in the case of response to periodic electrical stimulation. Cells were identified via the expression for the nuclear tdTomato tag and were only imaged in the area of interest, specifically in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Similar to the electrophysiology paradigm, for neuronal stimulation experiments, the electrode was placed in the hippocampus to stimulate the neuronal inputs originating in CA3. For electrical stimulation, approximately 20 µA over 200 µs was delivered to local axons using a stimulating bipolar microelectrode. For inhibitor experiments, TTX was directly diluted into the ACSF perfusion medium at 500 nM, oxygenated, and delivered to the slices through the perfusion system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;Calcium imaging analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis was done on calcium transients that were reliably evoked by axonal stimulation. To determine the effect of TTX on the calcium transients in response to electrical stimulation of the CA3 Schaffer collaterals, the field of cells were stimulated three times in 1-min intervals to ensure synaptic connectivity. TTX (500 nM) was then perfused into the slices and the stim was repeated on the same field of cells to gauge direct effect of TTX on stimulation response. For analysis, regions of interest of each responding nucleus were set and Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (maximum difference in fluorescence intensity normalized to background fluorescence) measurements were determined before and after TTX treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Visualization of human SCLC lung tumour gene expression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression data from 81 patients with SCLC primary tumours&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="George, J. et al.

Skin of the ventral surface of the neck was shaved and aseptically prepared according to IACUC guidelines. Under a dissection microscope, a 1 cm midline skin incision was made, and salivary glands revealed were separated with blunt dissection to expose the airways. The right vagal nerve was then carefully dissected from the carotid sheath and cut at the cervical level posterior to the pharyngeal branch. Sham mice underwent the same surgical procedure for blunt dissection of the vagus nerve but the latter was left intact. The mice were monitored until recovery from anaesthesia for changes in heart rate and respiration and after that monitored bi-weekly for changes in weight, eating, drinking, and general activity. RPM mice were handled the same way, except vagotomy was performed within 1 week of virus administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Bioluminescence imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For in vivo monitoring of tumour growth, bioluminescence imaging was performed using an IVIS imaging system (Xenogen).

Baseline bioluminescence was used to randomize mice by a blinded investigator so that experimental groups contained an equivalent range of tumour sizes.

That's not for nothing, either: they're genuinely great family dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a classic combo, and it never gets less awesome to watch. Just look at this video from Tuesday, September 9th, when one Golden retriever refused to let his favorite tiny human nap unattended. He was falling asleep too, but he was not about to let anything slip by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marleynyc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marley the Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marley the Golden Retriever &lt;/a&gt;is so sweet.

He lives in New York City with mom, dad, and their brand new baby. He used to be the only child in the house, which sometimes makes dogs angry. They don't like to share the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn't a problem for Marley, though: he was fine with that. Now, he has three siblings! He just wanted a friend, and the new baby was exactly what he needed. As soon as mom let him close to the baby, he was there. He was ready to show her he could be a good boy, and he did an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Them meeting was just too cute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micro-Gary is an awesome name for a baby. I think I'm going to name my first baby that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retrievers Know How to be Gentle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that Golden Retrievers are so popular in families is that they're like little mirrors. They match energies incredibly well: if you have a baby, they love snuggly naps and lying around while they play. As your baby grows, they love to run, play, and catch the food they drop on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these dogs can definitely be overbearing and very playful, they're also easy to train. They can and will learn how to behave around their new little friend!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/kindhearted-golden-retriever-insists-on-watching-human-newborn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade Pets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade Pets&lt;/a&gt; on Sep 10, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pet News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pet News&lt;/a&gt; section.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Daily Mail is campaigning for a national prostate cancer screening programme, initially targeted at high risk men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the clear benefits of the MRI scan only 62 per cent of men who needed a prostate MRI in England and Wales received one in 2019, the most recent year for when data is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, cancer specialists from 22 hospitals in 12 countries recruited 555 patients aged 59 to 70 to see whether a streamlined two-part ‘biparametric’ MRI could detect cancer at the same rate as a full three-part ‘multiparametric’ MRI, which is currently standard of care in the UK and includes a third stage where a dye is injected into the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All patients underwent the full three-part scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiologists then assessed the two-part scan without the dye, and separately assessed the three-part scan with the dye, for every patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A prostate biopsy was done when required to confirm whether or not the diagnosis was correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from University College London and University College London Hospital confirmed that the two-part scan was just as effective at diagnosing prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In total, 29 per cent of the patients had important prostate cancer diagnosed by the shorter two-part scan, the same percentage as the longer three-part scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three-part scan typically takes around 30 to 40 minutes and costs an average of £273 on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health secretary Wes Streeting has declared his support for a national prostate cancer screening programme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the two-part scan takes just 15 to 20 minutes, reduces the need for a doctor to be present and is 47 per cent cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings of the Prime trial, funded by the John Black Charitable Foundation and Prostate Cancer UK, are published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Associate Professor Veeru Kasivisvanathan, lead researcher and Chief Investigator on the trial from UCL Surgery &amp;amp; Interventional Science and UCLH, said: 'Currently around four million MRI scans are needed each year globally to diagnose prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This demand is set to rise rapidly with a predicted surge in prostate cancer cases over the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Time, cost and staff availability are all limiting factors in how many scans can be offered, which makes the results of the PRIME trial particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we can do the scan in up to half the time, with fewer staff and at lower cost, that will make a huge difference in allowing every man who needs a scan to be able to get one in a timely fashion.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS already offers national screening programmes for breast, bowel and cervical cancers - but not for prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee, which advises the government on which screening programmes to offer, is currently considering recent developments around prostate cancer diagnosis and is due to report its findings later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has also backed a national prostate cancer screening programme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Associate Professor Francesco Giganti, a lead radiologist on the trial from UCL Surgery &amp;amp; Interventional Science and UCLH, said: ‘The three-part multiparametric MRI scan has been a game-changer for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, sparing thousands of patients unnecessary biopsies and improving cancer detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Currently we inject a dye into the patient that highlights the presence of cancer on the MRI scan, but this step requires time and the presence of a clinician, and can on rare occasion cause mild side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being able to make accurate diagnoses without the contrast stage will reduce scan time meaning we can offer scans to more men using the same number of scanners and operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, it is vital that the scans are of optimal diagnostic quality and that they are interpreted by a radiologist with dedicated expertise in prostate MRI.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separately, Prostate Cancer UK’s Transform trial, the biggest prostate cancer screening trial for 20 years, is due to begin later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It will find the best way to screen men for prostate cancer, achieving the evidence needed for the introduction of a national screening programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results of the Prime trial are an important step towards realising this ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘The results from the PRIME trial, showing that a faster, cheaper, type of prostate MRI is just as good as the current standard MRI at detecting prostate cancer, are a hugely important step in the right direction for making MRIs more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Another trial is already happening in the UK and the results of the two trials together should provide the complete evidence package we need to change practice across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We encourage (health watchdog) NICE to prepare to review their guidelines as soon as that evidence base is complete, so that we can make MRI quicker, cheaper and less onerous for men.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health secretary Wes Streeting has declared his support for a national prostate cancer screening programme in a major boost for the Mail’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health secretary told MPs in April that he would like to see the NHS proactively offer men tests for the disease in a move that could prevent thousands of needless deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he is ‘particularly sympathetic’ to the argument that this should initially be targeted at high-risk men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The call for targeted screening has also been backed by former prime minister Rishi Sunak, former home secretary Sir James Cleverly and Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP and the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Moreover, we chose 24 matched controls without any PTC variants in &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt; or the other listed genes.

We specifically analysed chromosome 19 variants (location of &lt;i&gt;ABCA7&lt;/i&gt;). Each single-cell sample matched the expected WGS sample clearly, showing higher concordance (fewer mismatches) compared with all other ROSMAP WGS samples (examples are shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09520-y#Fig5"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Cell filtering metrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregated counts underwent quality control before cell annotation. Cells with fewer than 500 or more than 10,000 detected genes (count &amp;gt; 0) were removed. Next, we filtered cells by mitochondrial fraction (total mitochondrial counts divided by total gene counts), a measure of nuclear integrity. We log-transformed mitochondrial fractions and fitted a Gaussian mixture model (GMM, sklearn GaussianMixture) to identify and remove cells assigned to the GMM component with the highest mean mitochondrial fraction. This step removed approximately 20,000 low-quality cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We next considered cells in marker-gene expression space defined by known major cell-type markers for human PFC: astrocytes (159 markers), excitatory neurons (113), inhibitory neurons (83), microglia (97), oligodendrocytes (179), OPCs (143) and vascular cells (124)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Steinberg, S. et al.

Marker counts were normalized to total library size, mean-centred and scaled to unit variance. Incremental principal component analysis (sklearn IncrementalPCA) reduced dimensionality (top 50 principal components). Visually, cells projected onto the first two principal components formed distinct Gaussian-like clusters. Assuming each Gaussian cluster corresponded to a distinct brain cell type, we fitted another GMM to the projected data. The resulting ten clusters aligned clearly with known brain cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells poorly modelled by this GMM (log-probability &amp;lt; −100) and two clearly outlying clusters were removed.

A linear mixed-effects model (mixedlm() from statsmodels) tested cell-level fluorescence intensities, modelling genotype or treatment as a fixed effect and well of origin as a random effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For single-plane live imaging (TMRM, CellROX), images were binarized at the 75th percentile intensity threshold per channel to identify regions occupied by neuronal soma or processes, according to established methodology&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Esteras, N., Adjobo-Hermans, M.

Mean fluorescence intensities were quantified within these masked areas. For time-course imaging, images were spatially aligned by Fourier-based registration (phase cross-correlation), with alignment accuracy confirmed manually. A mask from the baseline (pre-FCCP) TMRM image (75th percentile threshold) was consistently applied across timepoints. For all live-imaging experiments, masked regions (wells) were treated as individual observations in statistical tests. Batch-wise &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-scaling was not required here, as data were not combined across batches for these experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One outlier (p.Tyr622*+H20; value 0.34) was identified and removed in the TMRM p.Tyr622* (with or without CDP-choline) experiment using the interquartile range (IQR) method (values outside Q1−2 × IQR or Q3 + 2 × IQR) and removed for plotting convenience. This did not affect the statistical significance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Aβ ELISA assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culture media were collected and analysed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, KHB3481 and KHB3441, respectively) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. For 4-week-old iNs, media were flash-frozen before analysis. For cortical organoids (aged 5–6 months; days 176–182), media were analysed immediately after collection following 3–4 weeks of treatment with 500 µM or 1 mM CDP-choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Electrophysiology recordings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiology recordings were performed using the Axon Multiclamp 700B amplifier and Clampex 11.2 software (Molecular Devices). Cells were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast imaging (Olympus BX-50WI microscope), placed in a recording chamber and perfused continuously at 2 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (32 °C) with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 2.4 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 1.2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 26 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and 11 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucose).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action potentials were elicited by injecting current steps in current-clamp mode. Whole-cell currents were recorded from a holding potential of −80 mV by stepping to various voltages in voltage-clamp mode. Spontaneous firing was recorded in cell-attached configuration. Recordings were filtered at 1 kHz (four-pole Bessel filter), digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1550B interface (Molecular Devices). Pipette solution contained 120 mM K-gluconate, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM ATP and 0.2 mM GTP. Data were analysed using pClamp 11.2 and GraphPad Prism 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For electrophysiology recordings from cortical organoids, day 150 organoids were dissociated using Accutase (StemCell Technologies, 07920, 40 min, 37 °C), plated onto #1 glass coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 50-194-4702) coated with PDL, laminin and Matrigel, and maintained in 2D culture with or without 100 µM CDP-choline for 2 weeks before recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous action potential outliers were identified using the IQR method (values outside Q1–Q2 × IQR or Q3 +Q2 × IQR) and removed, resulting in the exclusion of two datapoints (9.38 in p.Tyr622*; 6.15 in p.Tyr622* + CDP-choline). Cells recording zero spontaneous potentials (likely glial) were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Seahorse metabolic assays and OCR analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iPS-cell-derived neurons were differentiated directly in Seahorse XFe96/XF Pro microplates for 28 days before metabolic assays on a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer. Seahorse XF cell mito stress and oxidation stress tests were conducted according to manufacturer’s protocols using final drug concentrations of 2.5 µM oligomycin, 1 µM FCCP and 0.5 µM rotenone/antimycin. Data were analysed using XFe Assay v.2.6.3.5 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OCRs were monitored over time, with curves visually inspected (blinded) to exclude wells not responsive to drug injections. The following OCR metrics were computed from integrals of OCR curves between specific experimental intervals: (1) basal respiration (before oligomycin injection); (2) proton leak (after oligomycin, before FCCP); (3) maximal respiration (after FCCP, before rotenone/antimycin); (4) relative uncoupling (proton leak divided by basal respiration); and (5) spare respiratory capacity (maximal respiration divided by basal respiration).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;mRNA-seq and analysis of iNs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from iNs using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed (Fragment Analyzer, Agilent), and only samples with RNA quality number &amp;gt; 9.5 were selected. Full-length cDNA libraries were generated (SMART-seq v4 kit, Takara Bio), and sequencing libraries prepared (Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit, Illumina) for sequencing on the Element AVITI platform (Element Biosciences; 75 bp paired-end reads with dual 8-nucleotide indexes) at the MIT BioMicro Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequencing data were processed through the MIT BioMicro Center BMC/BCC pipeline v1.8 (updated 6 June 2023; &lt;a href="https://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter:Software#BMC-BCC_Pipeline"&gt;https://openwetware.org/wiki/BioMicroCenter:Software#BMC-BCC_Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;). Reads were adapter-trimmed (Trim Galore, Nextera-specific settings, minimum overlap 3 bases), aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p14, GENCODE release 47; STAR aligner), and counted (featureCounts, paired-end settings). Read counts were summarized at the exon level and aggregated by gene identifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential expression analysis (edgeR, limma-voom) retained protein-coding genes expressed at ≥1 CPM in ≥1 sample, normalized counts and used linear modelling with empirical Bayes moderation with contrasts based on experimental conditions (treatment/genotype). fGSEA (10,000 permutations) of WikiPathways gene sets (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09520-y#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) was performed using ranked differentially expressed genes (score: sign(log[FC]) × −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;]), as described above (see the ‘Gene-set enrichment and Kernighan–Lin pathway clustering’ section). Significant pathways (adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were identified, and leading-edge genes underwent gene–pathway clustering (Kernighan–Lin heuristic, described above). Gene–pathway cluster similarity was assessed by computing Jaccard indices based on pathways and genes assigned to each Kernighan–Lin cluster. The significance of observed overlaps was determined empirically through comparison to 1,000 random permutations, with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control the FDR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;LC–MS lipidomics on iNs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iPS-cell-derived neurons were washed in cold PBS, scraped, centrifuged (2,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 5 min), counted, pelleted to equal number and resuspended in cold methanol (2 ml). Biphasic extraction was performed by sequentially adding cold chloroform (4 ml) and cold water (2 ml), vortexing after each addition, then centrifuging (3,000 rcf, 10 min) for phase separation. Samples prepared at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry were similarly processed from provided pellets (in 500 µl methanol), supplemented with additional methanol (1.5 ml) and chloroform (4 ml), sonicated (10 min), mixed with water (2 ml) and centrifuged (800 rcf, 10 min, 4 °C). Upper aqueous phases were collected for metabolomics, while chloroform phases were reserved for lipidomics. At least one blank control (no cells) was included in each extraction run. All LC–MS analyses were performed by the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracted samples were dried under nitrogen, fully evaporated, resuspended in chloroform (scaled by biomass (cell count); ≥60 µl), and split equally for positive and negative ionization analyses (or unsplit if only positive mode). After centrifugation (18,000 rcf, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were transferred into microinserts for LC–MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC–MS analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Exactive plus MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) consistent with an Ultimate 3000 LC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in positive- and negative-ionization modes (in WT versus p.Tyr622* only in positive mode), in top five automatic data-dependent MS/MS mode. Chromatography separation was performed on the Biobond C4 column (4.6 × 50 mm, 5 µm particle size; Dikma Technologies). The flow rate began at 100 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; with 0% mobile phase B (MB) for the initial 5 min, followed by an increase to 400 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; over the next 50 min with a linear gradient of MB from 20% to 100%. The column was subsequently washed at 500 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for 8 min with 100% MB, then re-equilibrated for 7 min at 500 µl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; using 0% MB. For positive-ion mode, mobile phases consisted of buffer A (MA: 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid and 5% methanol in water) and buffer B (MB: 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid, 5% water and 35% methanol in isopropanol). For negative-ion mode, buffer A (MA) contained 0.03% ammonium hydroxide and 5% methanol in water, and buffer B (MB) contained 0.03% ammonium hydroxide, 5% water and 35% methanol in isopropanol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipids were identified, and their signals integrated using the Lipidsearch software (v.4.2.27, Mitsui Knowledge Industry, University of Tokyo). Integrations and peak quality were curated manually. Peak areas were background-corrected (subtracting 3× median blank peak areas; negative values set to zero). Statistical analyses were performed using Welch’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests (unequal variance) to compare different cell lines, and Student’s &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests (equal variance) for treatment comparisons within identical genetic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;LC–MS metabolomics on iNs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples were dried under nitrogen, evaporated completely and resuspended in biomass-scaled volumes (≥20 µl) of 50% acetonitrile in water. After centrifugation (maximum speed, 10 min), consistent volumes (12 or 15 µl, depending on batch) of supernatants were transferred to microinserts. The remainder of the sample volumes was combined to create a pool sample used for MS2/MS3 data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LC–MS metabolomics analyses were performed at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry using a Vanquish LC system coupled with an ID-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples (5 µl injection) were analysed on a ZIC-pHILIC peek-coated column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm particle size; Sigma-Aldrich) held at 40 °C. Mobile phases comprised buffer A (20 mM ammonium carbonate and 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in water) and buffer B (97% acetonitrile in water). The gradient initiated at 93% B, decreasing linearly to 40% B over 19 min, further decreasing to 0% B over the subsequent 9 min, held at 0% B for 5 min, returned to 93% B within 3 min and finally was re-equilibrated at 93% B for 9 min. The flow rate was held constant at 0.15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, except for an initial 30 s ramp from 0.05 to 0.15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. MS data were acquired in polarity-switching mode at 120,000 resolution, with an AGC target of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, covering an &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; range from 65 to 1,000. MS1 acquisition used polarity switching for all samples. MS2 and MS3 analyses were performed on pooled samples using the AcquireX DeepScan method, with five reinjections each in positive- and negative-ion modes separately. A mixture containing standards of targeted metabolites was prepared and analysed immediately after the sample runs for targeted metabolite analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were analysed using Compound Discoverer 3.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Metabolite identification was based either on MS2/MS3 spectral matching against a local mzVault library and corresponding retention times from pure standards (level 1), or spectral matching using mzCloud (level 2). Each metabolite identification was manually inspected. Blank samples were used to exclude background compounds (compounds for which the area in at least one sample was not higher than three times the area in the blanks). Median-centred peak areas were scaled to zero-mean and unit variance before principal component analysis. The Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry identified three samples with notably low overall metabolite intensities, which were subsequently excluded from downstream analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;LC–MS metabolomics on medium&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium samples (100 µl each) were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of methanol and incubated at −20 °C for 2 h. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 18,000 rcf for 20 min at −9 °C, and the supernatants were transferred into new tubes and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen flow. The dried samples were resuspended in 50 µl of 30% acetonitrile in water containing 2 mM medronic acid, centrifuged again at 18,000 rcf for 20 min at 4 °C and the resulting supernatants were transferred into glass microinserts for LC–MS analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peak areas from targeted metabolite analysis of media samples were compared for CDP, CDP-choline and choline. To ensure accurate detection, solvent blanks were analysed: CDP and CDP-choline were not detected in these blanks, while choline was detected at levels several orders of magnitude lower than in medium samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Molecular dynamics simulations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABCA7 structures (unbound-open and bound-closed conformations; Protein Data Bank (PDB): &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8EE6/pdb"&gt;8EE6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8EOP/pdb"&gt;8EOP&lt;/a&gt;) containing the G1527 variant were retrieved from the PDB. The A1527 variant was generated by mutation (Gly to Ala) using PyMOL v.2.0. ABCA7 residues 1517–1756 were embedded in a DPPC membrane (CHARMM-GUI) and oriented according to the OPM database. Four simulations were performed (GROMACS 2022.3; CHARMM36M force field; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09520-y#MOESM1"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein–membrane system was solvated in a cubic box with a minimum distance of 1.0 nm between the protein and the box edge, using the TIP3P water model. Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent algorithm with a maximum force threshold of 1,000 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; nm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to relieve any steric clashes or bad contacts. The system was equilibrated in six phases, each 125 ps long, to equilibrate volume (NVT) and pressure (NPT). The production run, 300 ns long, was performed in the NPT ensemble at 323 K using a V-rescale thermostat and 1 bar using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat. A 2 fs time step with H-bond constraints was used with periodic boundary conditions applied in all directions. Long-range electrostatics were handled using the particle mesh Ewald method with a cut-off of 1.0 nm for non-bonded interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The r.m.s.d. was calculated to monitor the conformational stability of a given structure over the course of the simulation by comparing the position of C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; under simulation to its reference position (in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8EOP/pdb"&gt;8EOP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb8EE6/pdb"&gt;8EE6&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;i&gt;ϕ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ψ&lt;/i&gt; dihedral angles were calculated using the gmx rama tool, followed by post-processing. Secondary structure analysis was performed using gmx dssp -hmode dssp, with subsequent post-processing using custom Python scripts. Visualization of the trajectories was carried out using VMD v.1.94 software. Principal component analysis was conducted on C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; atom positional fluctuations to identify the major conformational changes during the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;Eukaryotic cell lines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human iPS cell lines used in this study were generated by the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory iPSC core. The initial parental cell line (AG09173) was obtained from the Coriell Institute. HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were sourced from ATCC. iPS cell lines were confirmed by cell marker staining, RNA-seq and karyotyping. No further authentication of HEK293T cells was performed. All cell lines used here tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Use of large-language models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT (OpenAI) was used to edit portions of the manuscript text for brevity and clarity, and to assist in generating selected plotting code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Ethics statement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study protocol involving the use of human stem cells was approved by the Coriell Institutional Review Board (Coriell IRB) in compliance with DHHS regulations (45 CFR Part 46). The initial cell lines were obtained from the Coriell Institute, which ensured that informed consent was received from all donors. Donors were informed that their tissue donations would be used for the creation of cell lines intended for educational and research purposes, and that all biological materials would be anonymized.

The experiments were approved by the local ethics committee on animal experiments (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen). Mice were housed in groups of up to five animals per cage and supplied with standard pellet food and water ad libitum with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, while the temperature was controlled to 21–22 °C with a relative humidity of 45–65%. Animals were regularly examined for body condition, body weight, accelerated breathing, behaviour, tumour size (&amp;lt;1.5 cm in diameter) and neurological symptoms. In compliance with the respective animal permissions, animals were killed before or immediately after reaching a severe burden. Mice of both sexes were included. For animal experiments performed at Stanford University, mice were maintained according to practices approved by the US National Institutes of Health, the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. The study protocol was approved by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (protocol 13565).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Cell lines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse cell lines (AVR424.3 and RP1462) were isolated from mouse tumours in the RP line and identified by genotyping. Human cell lines (COR-L88, H1836, H69, H146, DMS273, H524, H211, H526, H1975, HCC44, HOP62, H2291 and HEK293T) were gifts from R. Thomas, University Hospital of Cologne, and identified through STR profiling. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Statistics and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical tests used are reported in the figure legends and specific methods sections. No measurements were performed more than once on the same sample. Statistical analyses were performed with Python v3.8, v3.9 and v3.10 with the packages pandas v1.1.4 and numpy v1.20. Whenever necessary, correction for multiple testing was performed with the FDR using the Python package statsmodel v0.12.2 with the method ‘Benjamini/Hochberg’. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and the corresponding &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated using scipy v1.6.3. Statistical analysis of survival was performed with lifelines v0.25.6. The packages matplotlib v3.4.2 and seaborn 0.11.0 were used for visualization. The micrographs depicted are representative of repeated experiments, as detailed in the figure legends or as follows: Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09434-9#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;, 10 experiments;

Aligned reads that did not align to the consensus TTAA target sequence were excluded. At each TTAA locus in each sample, reads derived from the same fragment, identified by the identical position of the read ends, were collapsed. TTAA loci were kept if five or more different fragments were identified. Germline insertions were identified by the presence of ten or more different fragments at a TTAA locus in tail or ear samples. These TTAA loci were excluded from analysis in the whole cohort and the sequences 1 Mb upstream and downstream were masked from analysis of tumours from the affected mice. The 10-Mb regions encompassing the donor loci were also masked from analysis (chromosome 5:50000000–70000000 for the RPLH line and chromosome 10:0–10000000 for the RPLS line). Insertions detected in more than one tumour were assigned to the tumour with the highest number of fragments. For each of the 17,153 protein-coding genes present in both the human and mouse genomes, we defined the included genomic range as the union of all the transcripts for the gene from the transcription start site (TSS) to the stop codon. The statistical analysis included two steps. First, at the sample level, the Poisson distribution was used to calculate the one-sided probability of seeing at least as many transposon fragments as were actually present. The rate used for the Poisson distribution was based on the total insertion rate within genes on each chromosome of each sample, on the total number of TTAA sites within genes on the chromosome and on the number of TTAA sites within each gene. We then calculated FDR-corrected &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; values for each sample and each gene. We obtained a total of 11,208 genes (an average of 37 genes per sample) that were significant at a cutoff of &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 at the sample level. To calculate the statistical significance of genes at the cohort level, we again used the Poisson distribution with a rate derived from distributing the 11,208 hits evenly across all non-masked genes of all samples and calculated the one-sided probability of seeing at least as many insertions in a given gene. We then calculated the FDR-corrected &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value at the cohort level for each gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Analysis of &lt;i&gt;piggyBac&lt;/i&gt; subcohorts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a two-sided permutation test to compare the distribution of the transposon insertions in different subcohorts: untreated versus chemotherapy, untreated versus immunotherapy and lung tumours versus metastatic tumours. For each comparison, the union of samples included in the comparison was shuffled 1,000,000 times, while maintaining the same number of samples from each mouse line in each subcohort (RPLH and RPLS). For each gene, we then counted the number of iterations in which the absolute difference in the fraction of samples carrying an insertion was greater than in the real configuration. We calculated the FDR-corrected &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value for each gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Simulation and annotation of possible human mutations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each gene included in the filtered GENCODE annotation v22, all possible single-nucleotide substitutions were simulated, annotated using ANNOVAR v2018Apr16 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Wang, K., Li, M. &amp;amp; Hakonarson, H.

For each simulated variant in each gene, only the most severe consequence among all the transcripts associated with the gene was kept. All simulated variants were also annotated using the total population frequency in non-cancer samples from the gnomAD v2.1.1 GRCh38 liftover exome and the gnomAD v3 genomes and excluded if they were found in more than 1 in 10,000 samples. On the basis of this simulation, the number of possible non-synonymous or severe variants for each gene was used for calculation of the expected number of mutations in each gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Data collection of human somatic mutations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sample information and mutations were downloaded from the supplementary tables of the respective papers or from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) website (Cell_lines_annotations_20181226.txt and CCLE_DepMap_18q3_maf_20180718.txt; &lt;a href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/"&gt;https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle/&lt;/a&gt;). Where needed, the mutations were mapped to the TCGA GRCh38 reference (GRCh38.d1.vd1.fa) using the liftOver v385 tool from the UCSC database (&lt;a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu"&gt;http://genome.ucsc.edu&lt;/a&gt;; ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Kent, W.

The resulting 177,983 mutations were annotated as described above for the simulated variants; 613 mutations were excluded from analysis (517 mapped to mitochondrial genes and 96 could not be mapped to primary chromosomes in h38). The remaining 177,370 variants were left-aligned using GATK LeftAlignAndTrimVariants v4.1.3.0 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="McKenna, A. et al.

A total of 28 samples were excluded from analysis because they shared five or more mutations with a sample from a more recent study, leaving 456 samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Statistical analysis of the human cohort&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples sharing five or more mutations were merged (e.g., samples sequenced both before and after treatment). In total, 439 samples and 117,353 non-synonymous mutations were used for analysis. We used the Poisson distribution to estimate the one-sided probability of observing at least as many mutations by chance in each gene. To obtain the rate for the Poisson distribution for each gene, we divided the total number of non-synonymous mutations, counting each sample at most twice per gene, by the total number of possible non-synonymous mutations within the 17,153 protein-coding genes present in both the human and mouse genomes. For each gene, we then multiplied this value by the number of non-synonymous mutations that were theoretically possible in the gene (see simulations above). The rate therefore represented the expected number of non-synonymous mutations under a uniform distribution model. For each gene, we then calculated the probability of observing at least as many mutations as were actually present. We corrected the resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for multiple testing using the FDR to derive the &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value for each gene. Finally, we repeated this analysis but included only severe mutations (stop gain, start loss, frameshift and canonical splicing) to derive the probability of observing at least as many severe mutations as were actually present. The same analysis was performed on subsets of the whole cohort to compare the statistical significance across subcohorts.

Snap-frozen RP tumours were thawed in a 60-mm dish on ice and sharply minced with a precooled scalpel. Subsequently, the minced tissue was transferred to a gentleMACS M-tube (Miltenyi) and the 60-mm dish was rinsed with lysis buffer 1, which was then added to the gentleMACS M-tube. The tissue was dissociated using programme ‘Protein-M-tube 1.0’ of gentleMACS (Miltenyi). Lysis buffer 2 was added to the M-tube, followed by inversion. The lysed tissue was filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer prewetted with lysis buffer 1. Centrifugation (5 min, 450&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 4 °C, with breaks; Eppendorf) was conducted to pellet the nuclei. Next, the supernatant was discarded and the nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer 3 and kept on ice. Sucrose buffer was drawn into a 25-gauge needle and syringe and ejected underneath the nuclear suspension, followed by centrifugation (5 min, 450&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 4 °C, with breaks). The upper phase was removed, and the nuclei were gently resuspended in resuspension buffer and filtered through a 15-µm cell strainer. Fixation of the nuclei, barcoding of single nuclei, amplification of barcoded cDNA and preparation of sequencing libraries were carried out according to the Evercode WT Mega v2.1.1 user manual (Parse Biosciences). Libraries were sequenced at the Cologne Center for Genomics using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument at an average depth of 216,310,743.5 reads per sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Processing of mouse snRNA-seq data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw sequencing data were processed using Parse scRNA-seq pipeline v1.1.1, which included alignment to the GRCm39.110 reference using STAR v2.7.10b and demultiplexing of cells to the corresponding samples based on the first barcode. The resulting raw count matrices and cell annotation files, together with the Ensembl GRCm39.110 gene annotations, were assembled into an Anndata object using scanpy v1.9.3. Cell detection and background removal were performed using Cellbender v0.3.0 with standard settings. Doublet filtering was performed using doubletdetection v4.2 with a voter threshold of 0.5 and a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value threshold of 0.001. Low-quality cells were filtered out using a two-step protocol. First, we excluded cells that had fewer than 25 protein-coding genes with at least 3 raw counts. Then, we log scaled four quality-control metrics and calculated the median and the median absolute deviation (MAD) for each. These metrics included the percentage of counts mapped to mitochondrial transcripts, the percentage of counts mapped to ribosomal transcripts, the percentage of counts included in the top ten most expressed genes and the total number of protein-coding genes. We excluded cells that had a value greater than 3 MAD from the median for each of these metrics, as well as cells with a value lower than 3 MAD from the median for the total number of genes. We also excluded genes that were not protein coding and genes that were not expressed in any cell. For clustering and visualization, the remaining counts were converted to transcripts per 10,000 (tp10k) by dividing by the median length of the transcripts for each gene and normalizing to 10,000 using scanpy.pp.normalize_total with the option to exclude highly expressed genes. The tp10k values were converted to a log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(tp10k + 1) scale, and the most variable genes were selected using scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes with standard settings. Principal-component analysis was performed using 100 components, and these were batch corrected with Harmony using scanpy.pp.harmony_integrate with standard settings. Neighbours were calculated using scanpy.pp.neighbors with 100 neighbours and using the cosine distance. Leiden clusters were calculated using scanpy.tl.leiden with a resolution of 0.5. Coarse connectivity of the manifold was calculated using PAGA with scanpy.tl.paga and used as the starting point for uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding with scanpy.umap using standard settings.

The top of the skull was removed, followed by extraction of the brain and brainstem to expose the base of the skull. Under stereomicroscopic visualization, a midline incision was made into the occipital bone plate, extending rostrally from the foramen magnum. The occipital bone plate was then detached from the temporal bone to expose the vagus nerve and its associated nodose ganglion. Following isolation, surrounding tissues and the ganglion capsule were carefully removed using fine scissors and forceps. The isolated ganglia were then plated in 96-well plates (Sarstedt) precoated with collagen I (Ibidi) and containing Neurobasal-A medium (Gibco), supplemented with 2% FBS (Gibco), 2% B27 supplement (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 0.5 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), 25 µM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamate (Sigma), 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; nerve growth factor (Alomone Labs), 20 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (PeproTech) and 20 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; brain-derived neurotrophic factor (PeproTech). Explant cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; throughout the experiment. Medium changes were performed once per week. Twelve days after plating, explant cultures were examined under a microscope to evaluate attachment and extension of neurites. Only explants exhibiting neurite outgrowth were used for subsequent co-culture experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;Monitoring of proliferation in cell culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proliferation was assessed using IncuCyte live-cell imaging. Cancer cells were stably transduced using lentiviral vectors carrying an EF1α-tdTomato-IRES-G418 transgene. For co-culture experiments, 30,000 fibroblasts or neurons were plated per well. For analysis of high-density monocultures, 3,000 non-fluorescent cells were plated per well. Conditioned medium was collected from neuronal cultures and filtered through 0.2-µm filters. Two thousand cancer cells were added to each well and transferred into the IncuCyte system 1 day after initiation of co-culture. Whole-well images (×4 objective) were captured every 6 hours for a total of 6 days. Bright-field and fluorescence channels were acquired (557 nm, 607 nm). The captured images were analysed using IncuCyte analysis software (Sartorius) to quantify total integrated intensity as a measure of cell proliferation. As a control, cells in monoculture were plated in separate wells on the same plate and were maintained under identical culture conditions. The intensity was normalized to the intensity of the first scan, and the AUC was calculated over 5 days of culture. The AUC was further normalized to the AUC of monocultures in the same plate.

For visualization of nodose fibres, the ganglia were transduced with a peripheral nervous system-specific AAV encoding tdTomato (AAV-PHP.S-hSyn-tdTomato-P2A-APEX2-V5; VectorBuilder) and seeded into 96-well plates. Two thousand COR-L88 cells were added once neurites started to form, and cultures were monitored for 5 days at ×4 resolution over the whole well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;RABV tracing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons were plated at a density of 60,000–70,000 cells per coverslip (24-well plate) on poly(&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine) (0.1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;; Merck)-coated glass coverslips. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal serum-free medium (Gibco) containing B27 supplement (1%; Gibco) and GlutaMAX (0.5 mM; Merck). Neurons were then maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; throughout the experiment and semi-feeding was performed once per week. SCLC cells were transduced with retroviruses encoding DsRed alone, DsRed and TVA, or DsRed, TVA and G and preconditioned in Neurobasal medium for 48 h before seeding of 500 cells onto the neuronal layer. At neuronal division 12 (DIV12)–DIV13, EnvA-pseudotyped (Δ&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;) RABV encoding GFP was added to the medium. Analysis was performed after an additional 3 days in culture, at which time samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4% in PBS; Sigma) and the number of GFP-only-positive presynaptic neurons was quantified and normalized to the number of double-positive starter SCLC cells. For quantification, a confocal Stellaris microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a ×10 air objective was used to acquire two distinct ROIs of 3 × 3 tiles randomly chosen within the coverslip, and two coverslips for each condition were examined per biological replicate. One embryo preparation obtained from a pregnant mouse was considered to be a biological replicate. Within each ROI, GFP-positive neurons were manually counted using the plugin Cell Counter v3.0.0 for ImageJ v1.54h, and their numbers were normalized to those of DsRed and GFP double-positive starter cancer cells. A minimum of four biological replicates per condition were used for quantification. The &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; value was calculated by comparing each condition to the full experimental system (DsRed, TVA, G) using a two-sided Mann–Whitney test followed by FDR correction. For time-lapse imaging, COR-L88 cancer cells were transduced with a DsRed retrovirus encoding G and TVA, followed by addition of RABV-GFP 2–3 days later. After 24 h, cancer cells were washed thoroughly with PBS, trypsinized and plated onto DIV12 neuronal cultures. The resulting co-cultures were placed in an IncuCyte live-cell analysis system (Sartorius) for the subsequent 72 h. For monosynaptic tracing experiments of grafted cancer cells in vivo, a suspension of retrovirally transduced mouse SCLC cells derived from the RP model and freshly added EnvA-pseudotyped (Δ&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;) RABV-GFP were infused into the hippocampus of mice as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 76" title="Bergami, M. et al.

A portion of the skull covering the somatosensory cortex (from bregma: caudal, −2.0; lateral, 1.5) was thinned with a dental drill, avoiding disturbing the underlying vasculature, and a small craniotomy sufficient to allow penetration of a glass capillary was performed. A finely pulled glass capillary containing a suspension of mouse SCLC cells derived from the RP model in sterile PBS was then inserted through the dura to reach the hippocampus, and an estimated total of about 30,000–50,000 cells (corresponding to a total injected volume of 0.8–1.0 µl) were slowly infused using a manual syringe (Narishige) in multiple vertical steps spaced by 50 µm (−1.9 to −1.3 from bregma) over a total duration of 10–20 min.

The white-light laser was used as the main excitation source, tuned to the best excitation wavelength for each fluorophore, at a pulse frequency of 80 MHz. Blue-shifted dyes were excited using a separate 405-nm DMOD laser. 3D STED images were acquired using a theoretical pixel size set between 20 and 37 nm.

Near-infrared and/or far-red emissions were detected using a Power HyD R SP detector, red-shifted emissions were detected using Power HyD S SP Core Unit detectors, green-shifted emissions were detected using Power HyD X SP detectors and blue-shifted emissions were detected using HyD S SP detectors, in the presence of the respective notch filter set STED 3X. The detectors were set to either counting intensity or counting τSTED mode. 3D reconstructions were done through the 3D viewer in LAS-X. ONE microscopy images were acquired using a 12-kHz tandem scanner with and without dynamic signal enhancement (between 5 and 11, weighing of 0.4).

For brain tissue, 100-µm sections (obtained with a Leica vibratome) were stained for nuclei with DAPI (ThermoFisher; 3 µM) and placed into imaging dishes with a glass bottom (Ibidi) filled with PBS. Co-cultures were directly grown in glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, P356-1.5-14-C) coated with a carbon finder pattern using a mask (Leica, 16770162) and an ACE 200 carbon coater (Leica). Cells were fixed for 10 min with electron microscopy-grade 4% formaldehyde in PBS. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; stacks of the ROI showing reporter-positive tumour cells (DsRed or tdTomato) were acquired using an SP8 confocal microscope (Leica). After confocal and bright-field imaging, samples were prepared for transmission electron microscopy using standard protocols. In brief, post-fixation was applied using 1% osmium tetroxide (Science Services) and 1.5% potassium hexacyanoferrate (Merck) for 30 min at 4 °C. After three 5-min washes with double-distilled water, samples were dehydrated using an ascending ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 100%) with 10 min at each step. Infiltration was carried out with a mixture of 50% epon in ethanol for 1 h, 70% epon in ethanol for 2 h and 100% epon overnight (Merck). After incubation with fresh epon for 4 h, vibratome sections were mounted onto empty polymerized epon blocks and covered with Aclar foil to provide a flat surface. For co-cultures, TAAB capsules (Agar Scientific) filled with epon were placed upside down onto the glass bottom. Samples were cured for 48 h at 60 °C. Aclar foil was removed by peeling it off, and the glass bottom was removed by alternating between putting the dish in boiling water and liquid nitrogen. Samples were trimmed to the ROI, which was previously acquired by confocal microscopy, using a diamond 90° trimming tool (Diatome). For orientation, stereotypic shapes of the hippocampus including the granule cell and molecular layers as well as the vasculature were used and matched to measurements obtained from confocal images of the same region. For cell culture, the carbon pattern was used to find the back ROI. Serial sections (300 nm) were cut using an UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica) and collected onto pioloform (Plano)-coated slot grids. Post-staining was performed with 1.5% uranyl acetate (Agar Scientific) for 15 min and Reynolds lead citrate (Roth) solution for 3 min. Electron micrographs were acquired using a JEM-2100 Plus transmission electron microscope (JEOL) operating at 200 kV and equipped with a OneView 4K camera (Gatan). Tomograms of ROIs were acquired using SerialEM v3.7.11 and reconstructed using IMOD v4.11.7 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 82" title="Mastronarde, D.

The obtained brain slices were transferred to a chamber containing aCSF recording solution (125.0 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 25.0 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 25.0 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucose, 4.0 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 3.5 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, adjusted to pH 7.4 and 310 to 320 mOsm). Slices were stored for at least 30 min to allow recovery before performing recording. All recordings were performed using a microscope stage equipped with a fixed recording chamber and a ×20 water-immersion objective (Scientifica). For ex vivo experiments, recordings were performed in aCSF recording solution. For in vitro experiments, SCLC cells (day 3–6 in mono- or co-culture) were used, and recordings were performed in extracellular solution (124.0 mM NaCl, 10.0 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucose, 10.0 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3), 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, adjusted to pH 7.4). Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 5 to 10 MΩ were made from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (GB150-10, 0.86 mm × 1.5 mm × 100 mm; Science Products) with a horizontal pipette puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments). The patch pipette was filled with internal solution (4.0 mM KCl, 2.0 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 135.0 mM potassium gluconate, 10.0 mM HEPES, 4.0 mM ATP(Mg), 0.5 mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP)(Na) and 10.0 mM phosphocreatine, adjusted to pH 7.25 and 290 mOsm (sucrose)). Recordings were performed with an ELC-03XS patch-clamp amplifier (npi electronic) controlled with Signal software (v6.0; Cambridge Electronic). Experiments were recorded with a sampling rate of 12.5 kHz. The signal was filtered with two short-pass Bessel filters that had cut-off frequencies of 1.3 and 10 kHz. Capacitance of the membrane and pipette was compensated by using the compensation circuit of the amplifier. All experiments were performed under visual control using an Orca-Flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu) controlled with Hokawo software (v2.8; Hamamatsu). SCLC cells were identified by expression of the cytosolic fluorescent protein DsRed or tdTomato. Cells were clamped at a holding potential of −30 mV after rupturing the membrane, and spontaneous activity was recorded for 5 min in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode. Synaptic inputs were isolated by adding the following blockers to the recording solution: CNQX (Sigma, C127; 10 µM), &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-AP5 (Sigma, A8054; 20 µM), bicuculline (bicuculline-methiodide; Sigma, 14343; 100 µM), riluzole (Sigma; 10 µM) and TTX (1 µM). sPSCs were identified and measured with Igor Pro (v32 7.01; WaveMetrics) using a semiautomatic identification script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec55"&gt;Electrophysiology of H524 cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For in vitro experiments, SCLC cells (on day 3 in mono- or co-culture; see also above) were used, and recordings were performed under constant superfusion of oxygenated aCSF (130 mM NaCl, 1.25 mM NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 mM NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 mM &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-glucose, 3.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, adjusted to pH 7.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 6–8 MΩ were made from borosilicate glass 3.3 capillary tubing with filament (outer diameter, 1.5 mm; inner diameter, 1.2 mm; length, 100 mm; Hilgenberg). The patch pipette was filled with a caesium-based internal solution (125 mM CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S, 16 mM KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.0 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 4.0 mM ATP(Mg), 0.3 mM GTP(Na) and 10 mM QX-314-Cl, adjusted to an osmolarity of 295 mOsm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voltage-clamp recordings were performed with an Axon MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized by an Axon Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices). Electrophysiological recordings were acquired using Clampex (v10.7.0.3; Molecular Devices). Experiments were recorded with a sampling rate of 20 kHz for spontaneous event recordings or 50 kHz for optogenetic experiments. The signal was filtered at 3 kHz. Pipette capacitance was compensated using the compensation circuit of the amplifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All experiments were performed under visual control using a Teledyne Moment camera (Teledyne Technologies) controlled with Micro-Manager software (v2.0). SCLC cells were identified by expression of the cytosolic fluorescent protein tdTomato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological receptor blockade was performed by bath application of &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-AP5 (Sigma, A8054; 20 µM) and/or Gbz (MCE, HY-103533; 12.5 µM). The event frequency of spontaneous synaptic events was analysed using Clampfit v11.2.2.17 (Molecular Devices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For optogenetic experiments, neuronal cultures were first transduced at DIV2 with a mixture of CMV-driven Cre-expressing AAV (Addgene, 105537-AAV9) and double-&lt;i&gt;loxP&lt;/i&gt;-flanked ChR2–eYFP AAV (Addgene, 20298-AAV1). For optogenetic stimulation of co-cultured neurons expressing ChR2–eYFP, the microscope was equipped with a SOLIS-470C LED (470-nm peak; Thorlabs), triggered for 5 ms at approximately 50% peak power every 120 s. An average trace of three recordings was calculated and subsequently analysed. Synaptic event peak amplitude was analysed using Clampfit v11.2.2.17 (Molecular Devices). In cases where synaptic events were abolished, the peak current in the corresponding temporal region of the previous synaptic event was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec56"&gt;Preclinical SCLC mouse model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For preclinical experiments, we used the RP genetically engineered mouse model for SCLC, in which tumour formation is driven by Cre-inducible conditional &lt;i&gt;Rb1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trp53&lt;/i&gt; knockout, as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Meuwissen, R. et al.

Tumours were induced and monitored with MRI as described above. Following tumour detection (minimum tumour size of 5 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), mice were randomly assigned to the treatment cohorts, with sample size determined by power analysis. Compound solutions were prepared and injected as follows: etoposide (Hexal) was administered on days 1, 2 and 3 of a 14-day cycle, intraperitoneally, at a concentration of 8 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Cisplatin (Accord) was administered on day 1 of a 14-day cycle, intraperitoneally, at a concentration of 4 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Riluzole (15 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dissolved in 10% DMSO, 40% PEG-300, 5% Tween-80 and 45% PBS and administered 5 days per week. DCPG (60 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dissolved in PBS and administered intraperitoneally for 5 days per week. Best response was calculated as the lowest percentage change measured from the last MRI scan before treatment, including only mice that had evaluable tumours at the first follow-up. The burden per mouse was calculated as the total sum of the volumes of individual tumours. Growth curves of the total burden of individual mice were linearly interpolated between scans. The median value of the interpolated curves was plotted for each day, as long as at least seven mice were alive in the treatment cohort. The interpolated value at five times the initial burden was used to calculate the time to fivefold burden, excluding mice that did not reach a fivefold burden. Data from preclinical experiments were analysed with blinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec57"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09434-9#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 15:11:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBTTWwzYmcxNGEycE44VzhIUU5FLTJwOGN6dDZXZjJSUWdWbzkzazBjOEE5cHpfMG1seTY0X3A1QjhVUHZYUDhKeVlROExobUdEbEo0RU11eUNqMWpHMG1F</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，前列腺癌可以通过更短、更便宜的扫描来检测-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/81665626-4519-4b99-9a96-39a324af2445</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FT newspaper delivered Monday-Saturday, plus FT Digital Edition delivered to your device Monday-Saturday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 15:01:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1SUVIxVzZ6eko0b24wZm9ielkyMFUxOUl1TEowWUhSdGRVS3BtMU9sWFEwUE1fNENrNXkxSHJFYl84aEotaEJCcnZUUEZMbF92V3RlbjdhS1JDQVRDRGNsQ2xyUjB5SURyMlp3cUNsUUs</guid></item><item><title>盲金毛猎犬对被称为“好孩子”的反应是纯粹的幸福- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/blind-golden-retriever-reacting-being-125500329.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs without the use of their eyesight are nothing short of amazing.

            More school-age children and adolescents are now &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/childhood-obesity-recommendations-uspstf"&gt;obese&lt;/a&gt; than underweight, a new report from the United Nations’ children’s agency, UNICEF, has revealed, with 188 million young people affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460002356n9zactc0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/health/obesity-underweight-world-who-study"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; now exceeds underweight in all regions of the world except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, researchers found, having studied data from more than 190 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460003356nzqgqt8dm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obesity occurs when a person has excessive fat accumulation that presents a health risk, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/obesity#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. Children are deemed overweight when they are “significantly heavier than what is healthy for their age, sex and height,” UNICEF noted, adding that obesity is a severe form of overweight that leads to a higher risk of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460004356nck226z34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studying data from more than 190 countries, researchers found that in the past 25 years, the number of overweight children has doubled from 194 million to 391 million. Of those, a high proportion are classified as obese, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfe0xyhq0001356nk3ndtetm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The highest rates of obesity are seen in some Pacific Island nations, including 38% of 5- to 19-year-olds in Niue, 37% in the Cook Islands, and 33% in Nauru.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460005356nts2ost6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High-income countries also had high levels of obesity, including 27% 5- to 19-year-olds in Chile, and 21% in both the United States and the United Arab Emirates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460006356nqkjf6hcc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Excluding sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions, researchers said, with ultra-processed and fast foods that are high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives being targeted at and consumed by children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460007356n745djb9z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460008356nqrvi64sb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children. Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfe15cwy0000356nihp1n8mb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers noted that in high-income countries, overweight tended to be more common among children and adolescents in poorer households, eating nutrient-poor, unhealthy diets. However, in low-income countries, children were more likely to be overweight if they were from wealthier families who could afford larger quantities of food, including energy-dense food. In middle-income countries, the presence of overweight in children spanned all income categories, with ultra-processed foods and drinks more widely available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdzlb460009356nee7bzds6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prevalence of underweight children aged 5-19 has declined since 2000, from nearly 13% to 9.2%, researchers added, but they noted that undernutrition was still a “significant concern” among children under 5 in most low- and middle-income countries. Undernutrition can present as wasting, or stunting, the report added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;COVID-19 Vaccines Update from the Department of Consumer Protection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 10, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the date of this publication, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has not published updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines since December 2024. The Department of Consumer Protection (“Department”), the licensing and enforcement agency for pharmacies and pharmacy personnel, is receiving inquiries regarding a pharmacist’s authority to order, prescribe and administer the COVID-19 vaccine. In the absence of federal clarity on the use of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Department is issuing this guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy staff related to ordering, prescribing and administering the 2025-2026 seasonal COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CT General Statutes Section 20-633 permits pharmacists to order, prescribe and administer any vaccine not included on the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Adult Immunization Schedule to any patient who is eighteen years of age or older, provided the vaccine administration instructions for such vaccine are available on the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (“CDC”) website. In the absence of 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine administration instructions on the CDC website, the Department recommends pharmacists utilize the 2024-2025 vaccine administration instructions issued by the CDC until the later of:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;thirty days from September 10, 2025, or&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;upon inclusion of the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine on the CDC's Adult Immunization Schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pharmacist may continue to order, prescribe and administer all Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines to any patient who is eighteen years of age or older utilizing the 2024-2025 vaccine administration instructions from the CDC until the later of the dates set forth above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, pharmacists may administer all FDA approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines upon receipt of a verbal or written prescription from a prescribing practitioner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While federal actions may restrict eligibility for adults age eighteen (18) to sixty-five (65) with no underlying conditions, prescribers and pharmacists may order, prescribe and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to individuals who fall outside the eligibility criteria authorized by the FDA, consistent with “off-label” use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2024-2025 COVID-19 seasonal vaccine formulations are not subject to this guidance and may continue to be administered in accordance with their prior FDA approval.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DELAWARE COUNTY, Ohio — The Delaware Public Health District issued &lt;a href="https://www.delawarehealth.org/health-alerts/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.delawarehealth.org/health-alerts/"&gt;an alert&lt;/a&gt; on Monday following an increase in cases and outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease in the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health agency says there have been cases and outbreaks, particularly in day care centers, schools and among school-aged children since the beginning of last month.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is a very contagious and common illness that causes fever, mouth sores and skin rash, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus mostly affects infants and children, but older adolescents and adults can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms usually appear three to six days after exposure and can include fever, sore throat, painful mouth sores that may start as small red spots and turn into blisters, and a skin rash of flat or raised red spots or blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults can become infected and show no symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does hand, foot and mouth disease spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can get hand, foot and mouth disease by:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coming into contact with droplets that have virus particles after a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching an infected person or making other close contact like kissing, hugging or sharing cups or eating utensils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching an infected person’s feces, such as changing diapers, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching objects and surfaces that have the virus on them, such as doorknobs or toys, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and day cares should encourage and enforce regular hand washing among students and staff. People should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and shared items and avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth to help stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you treat hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPHD says there is no vaccine or specific treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. According to the CDC, most people get better in seven to 10 days with minimal or no medical treatment. To help manage symptoms, people can take over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain. Do not give children aspirin, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are encouraged to drink liquids so they can prevent dehydration. The CDC says mouth sores can make it painful to swallow, so kids may not want to drink much. Parents are encouraged to make sure their kids stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When can kids return to school and day care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPHD says kids can go to school and day care as long as they have no fever for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and feel well enough to be in class.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

ROACH: Our son passed away at 38 years old this past December with an end-stage alcohol-related liver disease. He had been sober for four years prior to this, but blood tests revealed that he had started drinking again. These same tests showed copper level readings in the 500s and liver deterioration in accordance with someone twice his age, which indicated the possibility of him having Wilson’s disease (a rare genetic liver disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6VXIWKVFFZFILPEW5SDNPEMYG4"&gt;He was in need of an immediate liver transplant, but this surgery wasn’t possible due to multiple varices, a large mass in his stomach, a failing kidney, and the fact that he would possibly bleed out from a surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZH2AMRXJPVHCDBYUKCEA5SR76Q"&gt;He had blood in his vomit and stools for at least two days (maybe more?) before going to the hospital. He hadn’t been feeling well for at least three weeks before then. He required over 11 units of blood during the first three to four days in the hospital and occasionally some after the treatment of his varices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AB3RNEJZPJAS7HEF7LO6H3QOYI"&gt;My question to you is, could his death have been prevented if he had gone to the hospital even a day earlier? -- B.Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HRM3O3GYUNHNJO5WJMJJPGW64U"&gt;ANSWER: I am very sorry for your son and for the fact that you have been dealing with potential guilt for so long. Wilson’s disease is, as you say, a rare genetic disease with abnormal copper metabolism, leading to copper deposition in the liver, eyes and brain. People with Wilson’s disease can have chronic liver disease or acute liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U7VPMGZIEBATNFTJMFL5CC4Q24"&gt;From what you are telling me, I think your son had did have chronic liver disease. (Varices are dilated blood vessels in the lower esophagus, which form due to high pressure in the portal veins of the liver, but this takes months or years to develop.) But I think he died of acute-on-chronic liver failure. The kidney disease and bleeding issues suggest this diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JEW7PB6A4JAK3LFQ5D4ZCAV5OQ"&gt;A day or a week wouldn’t have made a difference. Making the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease years earlier so that he could have avoided high-copper foods and starting him on chelation treatment would have prevented this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVVYMDTFV5HRRGWPM7MSX4SJWU"&gt;Having him avoid alcohol meticulously would have been helpful. Heavy alcohol use or binge-drinking on top of Wilson’s is very dangerous, and patients with Wilson’s are advised to avoid alcohol entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZZ7NFIQSRBGATDEUEDXK6IERL4"&gt;During acute-on-chronic liver failure, a liver transplant can be lifesaving, but it does sound like it was too late, probably weeks too late (considering the wait for organ transplants) for your son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: When I sit down on my recliner to take a break and read for a while, I will often doze off. But just when I’m slipping into a nap, my body makes a little spasm or jerk, which causes me to bite my tongue and, of course, painfully wakes me up. This happens every time, so I never get a nap!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5YKJQRU2ZJHVROLCFQXHNXCLKY"&gt;Have you heard of this, does it indicate a problem other than the obvious, and is there anything that might be done for it? -- S.T.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SLS4BEGRXNGLJEV7LHL6MLCP4M"&gt;ANSWER: Myoclonic jerks are common, especially when people are falling asleep. They do not normally indicate any particular nerve or muscle disorder, so it doesn’t need treatment. It’s a mystery to me why you notice them for naps but not at night during bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LSGFVW4VXRFXDHISZOGJCRWNVU"&gt;A night guard to protect your teeth and tongue might help you. Ask your dentist about getting one. Periodic limb movement disorder is a possibility. If you are having lots of leg movements during sleep, this is the likely diagnosis, but it sounds to me like you are just having the common myoclonic jerks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GXQWKZZE4FAULISPLXDYVNO5QE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Researchers followed 158 cognitively healthy older adults and found that higher iron levels in memory-related regions of the brain were associated with a greater risk of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk was even higher when participants also showed amyloid buildup, highlighting the interaction of multiple factors in dementia.

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain called amyloid beta and tau, which manifest years prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms and can be detected with positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Treatments targeting these proteins are only modestly effective, indicating that other factors may contribute to cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112745"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/brain-iron-alzheimers-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;If confirmed in larger studies with more diverse patient populations, the findings point to a role for QSM MRI in the workup of patients at risk of dementia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated levels of iron in the brain are one factor under investigation in recent years. Iron overload in the brain is known to drive neurodegeneration by inducing oxidative stress (an imbalance between two different types of molecules in your body: free radicals and antioxidants), exacerbating amyloid toxicity, disrupting tau protein function and promoting nerve cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain iron can be measured noninvasively through a special MRI technique called quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“QSM is an advanced MRI technique developed over the last decade to measure tissue magnetic susceptibility with good precision,” said the study’s senior author Xu Li, Ph.D., associate professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University and research associate at the F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“QSM can detect small differences in iron levels across different brain regions, providing a reliable and non-invasive way to map and quantify iron in patients, which is not possible with conventional MR approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Li and colleagues studied QSM MRI on 158 cognitively unimpaired participants drawn from the Johns Hopkins BIOCARD Study, a research project focused on the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. PET data was available for 110 of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acquired baseline QSM MRI data on the participants and then followed them for up to seven and a half years. They found that higher baseline magnetic susceptibility on MRI in the entorhinal cortex and putamen—two brain regions important to memory and other cognitive functions—was associated with a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment, a transitional stage preceding Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using QSM, we found higher brain iron in some memory related regions that are linked to a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and faster cognitive decline,” Dr. Li said. “This risk is even higher when the participants have higher levels of amyloid pathologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though amyloid burden and tissue susceptibility in the entorhinal cortex and putamen were independently associated with progression to mild cognitive impairment, they appeared to have synergistic effects, Dr. Li said, accelerating global cognitive decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in larger studies with more diverse patient populations, the findings point to a role for QSM MRI in the workup of patients at risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can use this kind of tool to help identify patients at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and potentially guide early interventions as new treatments become available,” Dr. Li said. “Also, besides serving as a biomarker, brain iron may become a future therapeutic target.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how brain iron contributes to Alzheimer’s disease, including its interaction with other Alzheimer’s disease-related pathologies like amyloid and tau proteins. On the therapeutic side, clinical trials could test iron-targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, we hope to make the QSM technology more standardized, faster and more widely accessible in clinical practice,” Dr. Li said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and cognitive decline research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e58987978a8a8e96a597968b84cb8a9782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Linda Brooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rsna.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RSNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Linda Brooks – RSNA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Radiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 12:44:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5DQlZ3S01wYjdPRWgtNDk3ZzNEdWJhUDRjam52VV9TbTNCQVN0NXdmbW9JM3BDZ3cwblNQeEN4cktBZDlxdTlRaUgwb1dKVWcxTHNnaUNCWDRyblN5d2lOcU5lRGxDeVh1VFdiYWdvT0FFQQ</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，您自己的口腔细菌可能会让您心脏病发作- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Bacteria normally found in the mouth could play a direct role in triggering a heart attack, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an examination of the arterial plaques collected from more than 200 patients with coronary artery disease, a team of scientists led by Tampere University in Finland found a surprisingly high percentage contained oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking," &lt;a href="https://www.tuni.fi/en/news/myocardial-infarction-may-be-infectious-disease"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Tampere physician Pekka Karhunen. "Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material – DNA – from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poor Oral Hygiene Could Be Taking a Toll on Your Heart, Expert Says&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/hygiene5020014"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2015.03.001"&gt;established a connection between oral health and cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;. The two often go &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1010368"&gt;hand-in-hand&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Karhunen and his colleagues to seek biomarkers that might explain the link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of their study was one of the main drivers of heart attack: &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;. This is the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, consisting of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances on the artery walls. It narrows the arteries, restricting blood flow, and sometimes even ruptures. This can prevent oxygen from reaching the heart, causing cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sampled coronary plaques from 121 patients who had died suddenly, as well as 96 patients who had undergone surgery to remove plaque from their blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team subjected these samples to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00108"&gt;quantitative polymerase chain reaction&lt;/a&gt; analysis, a technique for identifying microbes. They also used immunohistochemistry, which uses  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="173555" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; to identify specific toxins, and transcriptomics, which quantifies gene expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These assays revealed biofilms of several types of oral bacteria, the most common of which belonged to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viridans_streptococci"&gt;viridans streptococci&lt;/a&gt; group. Oral streptococci were found in 42.1 percent of coronary plaques from the sudden death patients and 42.9 percent of surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173719" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque.png" alt="Your Own Mouth Bacteria Could Give You a Heart Attack" class="wp-image-173719 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque.png 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque-622x415.png 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/bacteria-plaque-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173719" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A bacterial biofilm (red) found inside a coronary artery plaque. (Pekka Karhunen's research group/Tampere University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these bacteria was strongly correlated with severe atherosclerosis, death from heart disease, and death from a heart attack, the researchers found, particularly associated with a ruptured plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterial biofilms tended to be found right at the core of the plaques, out of reach of the body's immune response. If something else happens to the patient that adds more stress to the body, the biofilm could become inflamed, causing the plaque to rupture, thus triggering a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that other bacterial infections, respiratory  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="173555" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, poor diet, or the stress hormone norepinephrine could be potential culprits for triggering that inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation is needed to narrow down the role of oral bacteria in heart attacks, as well as identify the dangerous exacerbating factors and how the bugs get there in the first place. However, the results strongly suggest that oral health is far more important to heart health than we knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The present results suggest that the change from a stable soft‐core coronary atheroma into a vulnerable rupture‐prone coronary plaque, as well as the development of a symptomatic peripheral artery plaque, may be contributed to by a chronic bacterial infection in the form of a dormant biofilm that colonizes the lipid core and wall of the atheroma and evades immune detection," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding adds to the current conception of the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and opens new possibilities for the diagnostics and prevention of the fatal complications of atherosclerosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists at Baylor College of Medicine and international collaborators have discovered a previously unrecognized new player mediating clinically relevant effects of metformin: the brain. By uncovering a brain pathway involved in metformin's anti-diabetic action, researchers have discovered new possibilities for treating diabetes more effectively and precisely. The study appeared in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output in the liver. Other studies have found that it acts through the gut," said corresponding author Dr. Makoto Fukuda, associate professor of pediatrics - nutrition at Baylor. "We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team focused on a small protein called Rap1, found in a specific part of the brain known as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). The researchers discovered that metformin's ability to lower blood sugar at clinically relevant doses depends on turning off Rap1 in this brain region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, the Fukuda lab and his colleagues used genetically modified mice that lacked Rap1 in their VMH. These mice were fed a high-fat diet to mimic type 2 diabetes. When given low doses of metformin, the drug failed to lower their blood sugar. However, other diabetes medications like insulin and GLP-1 agonists still worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further show that the brain is a key player, the researchers injected tiny amounts of metformin directly into the brains of diabetic mice. The result was a significant drop in blood sugar, even with doses thousands of times smaller than what's typically given by mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin's effects," Fukuda said. "We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they're directly involved in the drug's action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain slices, the scientists recorded the electrical activity of these neurons. Metformin made most of them more active, but only if Rap1 was present. In mice lacking Rap1 in these neurons, metformin had no effect, showing that Rap1 is essential for metformin to "switch on" these brain cells and lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery changes how we think about metformin," Fukuda said. "It's not just working in the liver or the gut, it's also acting in the brain. We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although few anti-diabetic drugs act on the brain, this study shows that widely used metformin has been doing so all along. "These findings open the door to developing new diabetes treatments that directly target this pathway in the brain," Fukuda said. "In addition, metformin is known for other health benefits, such as slowing brain aging. We plan to investigate whether this same brain Rap1 signaling is responsible for other well-documented effects of the drug on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;

            A vaccine used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/06/australia/australia-koala-chlamydia-intl-dst-hnk"&gt;chlamydia&lt;/a&gt; in Australia’s&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/australia/australia-endangered-koalas-queensland-intl-hnk-dst"&gt; koala population&lt;/a&gt; has been approved for rollout, in a world-first project.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3y0002356nbnbizxab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from the University of the Sunshine Coast spent more than 10 years developing a single-dose vaccine to protect the famed Australian marsupial from the effects of chlamydia, which include urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death, the university said in a statement Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0003356nxq66mb4d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia is responsible for half of koala deaths in the country’s wild populations, which are predominantly found in the eucalyptus forests along Australia’s eastern coast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0004356nfsb1iofh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent,” Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at UniSC’s Centre for Bioinnovation, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/koala-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0005356nzt6d4790@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often used as an emblem of Australian culture, the fluffy gray marsupials can only be found in Australia, and are considered endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Aside from disease, the creatures are vulnerable to habitat loss, animal attacks and being hit by cars, and were named critically endangered in 2022, &lt;a href="https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/species/koala/" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;/a&gt;Australia’s World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
    &lt;/p&gt;

            They are also often victims of the deadly bushfires that have ravaged Australia in its summer months in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/australia/koalas-reduce-one-third-intl-hnk"&gt;recent years.&lt;/a&gt; This year, some 860 koalas in Budj Bim National Park were shot from the air to “reduce suffering” after a bushfire, CNN affiliate &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/koalas-shooting-victoria-national-park-petition/75fc6dee-9de9-4944-84c7-991c68bb9faa" target="_blank"&gt;9News reported.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0006356noo2b6qpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antibiotics were previously used to treat chlamydia in koalas, but the drugs often interfere with their ability to digest their staple diet of eucalyptus leaves, causing them to starve to death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0007356nnsyngqge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for production and widespread use, in a what researchers describe as a “world first,” the chlamydia vaccine has already been trialed on hundreds of wild and captive koalas, according to UniSC, which noted it had already been tested across multiple generations of the animal in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00938-5" target="_blank"&gt;a study published last year.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0008356n01rr3x41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study found that the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65 percent,” said researcher Sam Phillips, who led the study, which was the largest and longest study of wild koalas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0009356nmisgbd2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s based on Chlamydia pecorum’s major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection — reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z000a356nfgz5jc4a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In humans, chlamydia is a bacterial &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/health/college-hookup-culture-wellness"&gt;sexually transmitted infection&lt;/a&gt; that can cause infertility if left untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z000b356nbmqv64y1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating. In addition, baby koalas — known as joeys — can catch the disease from their mothers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

He decided to call his insurance company to make sure the shots were still covered. The customer service representative told him they only covered COVID shots given at a doctor’s office. So he called his doctor’s office at UCSF Medical Center to schedule an appointment. They told him they wouldn’t have the new shots in until October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jennifer Minton, 64, of Tiburon said she and her husband went to a local CVS without an appointment last Thursday and asked for COVID, flu and measles shots.

People are getting disparate advice from physicians and pharmacists because they’re confused. And the pharmacy companies are confused as to what to do. So they have varying policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, federal guidance recommended an annual COVID booster for everyone 6 months and older.

Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, federal regulators recently &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/fda-limits-covid-vaccine-eligibility-21018315.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;narrowed eligibility sharply&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated approvals from the Food and Drug Administration state that the latest COVID vaccines are restricted to people at high risk for severe outcomes from the disease, including people 65 and older and those “who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s similar to the guidance during the initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in early 2021 — but back then, access was restricted only because of limited supply, said Paula Cannon, a virology professor at USC Keck School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a rationing based on, ‘We want everybody to have it, but let’s get the most seriously impacted people vaccinated first,’” Cannon said. Over the following months, the shots became widely available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, she said, “This restriction is based on, well, politics. It’s not based on sound science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and chaos over who can get a vaccine, and where and how and how much it will cost, all lead to one known outcome, said Swartzberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When there’s confusion about these kinds of questions, the default for most people is to just not get vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said just in the past week, he’s heard from three people who’ve faced issues getting a vaccine in the Bay Area. He said even if Kennedy and the FDA were to reverse course and say, never mind, anyone can get it — which is very unlikely — the damage is already done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say for certain this is purposeful, but I can say the people making these decisions know that by creating confusion and creating barriers to getting vaccines, you decrease vaccine uptake,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And booster uptake was already low. In December 2021, the first year vaccines were available to everyone, 85% of Americans had gotten one. As of May 2024, only 22.5% of Americans were up to date on COVID shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear, Cannon and Swartzberg said: The COVID vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective. They substantially reduce your chance of severe infection and of needing to be hospitalized if you do get infected. And they greatly reduce your odds of dying of COVID. They also reduce your chance of getting infected, though only modestly, and only for a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon said that while we’ve seen COVID genetically mutate into different strains since March 2020, “the virus hasn’t changed as massively as much as it has in recent years.” She said last year’s COVID shot still offers solid protection against the currently circulating variants. The main reason to get this year’s updated booster is because protection from them wanes so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California public health officer Dr. Erica Pan said in a briefing with medical professionals Tuesday that the state is rejecting the new federal rules and instead endorsing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations from national medical professional organizations, which are in line with previous CDC and FDA guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recognize there is a lot of confusion, a lot of access issues,” she said. “We’ll likely have updates very soon on what we’re doing in California to promote insurance coverage, vaccine access and scope of practice for pharmacists and others to be able to provide vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Department of Public Health said Tuesday it expects to align with the state’s “science-based vaccine recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I get the updated COVID vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you had COVID during this year’s summer peak, experts recommend waiting between 3 and 6 months before getting an updated shot. That way, you take advantage of your natural immunity while you’ve got it, and spread out the protection from the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you do want to get your updated COVID vaccine right away and you are under 65, you likely can get it at a chain pharmacy like CVS, Walgreens, Safeway or Costco — where “most of us get our routine vaccines,” former Marin County Health Officer Matt Willis &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/how-to-find-the-new-covid-vaccine" data-link="native" class=""&gt;wrote on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not all have received supplies of the updated vaccine, so you’ll need to check their websites or call. (Kaiser also &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/health-wellness/coronavirus-information/vaccine-appointments" data-link="native" class=""&gt;says on its website&lt;/a&gt; that availability of the new shot is pending its experts' review of FDA approval and other federal guidance.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official FDA guidance says “adults 65 years of age and older and individuals 5 through 64 years who have at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.” The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;CDC maintains a list of those conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a long one. They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible you’ll be asked to attest that you have one of those conditions. Willis noted that “California pharmacies don’t ask for medical documentation or a doctor’s prescription for people who self-attest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a bit of a ‘wink wink’ kind of approach,” Cannon said. “It’s a ridiculous system where people have to game the system to do something that is completely and utterly reasonable” — getting a COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what if you feel you don’t qualify?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’ll all look at the menu and go, mental health disorders, that’s what 2025 has done to me,” Cannon said. “I think we’re all qualified to check that box.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you still determine you can’t attest to any of the conditions, Willis offered this reassurance:  “Your risk for serious illness is low. You probably don’t have to rush to get the shot, and you can always reach out to your medical provider for guidance on getting the shot ‘off label.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 11:02:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOby1VMkNGUFBsQ1pfMlpMX0tuQ2tpeDkxYy10UEYwMkUwM3ZxdGd3YnJHbTJkOGtuSV9tVFRTQ1djeUlwYVRRYzFJRHh0R0U1al9WWnh4NjZuWXlOOWZpTGRoUUZaRXQ4UHYyUlBzRnZiOTc4VUFSZWFHelJZaUdwWU9teWNPWEVoejBOWWVPRzlGMzJY</guid></item><item><title>这5个习惯让您的医生疯狂—并使您的健康处于危险之中- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-habits-annoy-doctors_l_68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people visit the doctor to help get or stay healthy. But health care providers can only work with the information you present to them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re dealing with a chronic health issue, the last thing you want to do is undermine a doctor’s efforts to help you get well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s so important to have a good doctor-patient relationship because the more your doctor knows you and your health, the better your care can be,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/zachary-bittinger-md-112037" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Zachary Bittinger" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/zachary-bittinger-md-112037" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Zachary Bittinger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a clinical assistant professor of family and community medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“But healthy relationships have boundaries. Making sure that you understand your doctor’s boundaries and your doctor understands yours is a core piece of it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With that in mind, we asked primary care physicians how patients might unintentionally interfere with their own care and what kind of behavior impedes a good doctor-patient relationship. Here’s what they shared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve predetermined your diagnosis and aren’t open to your doctor’s expertise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are aware that you’ve probably already looked up your symptoms online to try to get some sense of what you could be dealing with ― especially if you’ve been trying to get a proper diagnosis for a long time. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/medical-gaslighting-doctor-sneaky-signs_l_66310bd5e4b0c558f741d4a7" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Many patients experience medical gaslighting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66310bd5e4b0c558f741d4a7" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Many patients experience medical gaslighting&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes the only way to take back control is to do the research yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to acknowledge that health information is everywhere,” Bittinger said. “Sifting through it independently is to be expected these days, and it’s unfair to expect patients to not do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a difference between doing some research and insisting that you have a diagnosis without being open to what your doctor says. “It’s a careful balancing act,” Bittinger said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health care providers say they regularly hear from patients with a new health problem who think they know their diagnosis before they’re even examined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people use Google or ChatGPT to diagnose themselves, which can lead to the wrong diagnosis,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michaelazizmd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Michael Aziz" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68b73392e4b0ebb9e3c8772d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.michaelazizmd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Michael Aziz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; internist at Northwell Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

But it’s also crucial to be open to their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Morsa Images via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Morsa Images via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Don't prolong a doctor's appointment, especially if you're experiencing new symptoms.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You put off going to the doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While self-diagnosing can be a big issue, doctors say they also regularly see patients who drag their feet before visiting their physician. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many people wait too long before being seen,” Aziz said. Unfortunately, Bittinger noted, that can make it harder for your doctor to treat your issue, given that many conditions tend to worsen over time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bittinger also said it’s crucial to see your health care provider for a persistent issue because they can help ease your fears. “I don’t want people staying up all night, worrying they might have cancer when it could be something else,” he explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text

that “not being straightforward about confounding variables” that can influence your health is a big potential issue she sees a lot. “Things like cigarette use and alcohol use are important to know,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that doctors shouldn’t be judgmental when it comes to a patient’s health,

vis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The best time to mention your most important one or two issues is right at the beginning,” she said. “Do not tell me ‘What I really came for was...’ while I am on the way out of the door.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O’Mahony also requests that patients have patience with the diagnostic process. “I may not have the answer on the first visit,” she said. “If I can’t make a diagnosis, I might order tests, or I might schedule a return visit to monitor if the symptoms are getting better or worse.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you're experiencing intense side effects or issues with a medication, talk to your doctor ASAP so you don't experience a lapse in treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You stop taking your medication before chatting with your physician.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O’Mahony stressed the importance of continuing to communicate with your doctor about your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;treatment plan, especially if it involves a new medication that doesn’t seem to be a good fit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If a treatment does not work or causes some sort of side effect, as a patient, you have to let the doctor know,” she said. “I have patients come to me and tell me that they did not go back to a particular doctor, even though they had a scheduled follow-up appointment, because ‘the medicine they gave me did not work.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That might be really important information for the doctor to hear and likely why they scheduled a follow-up appointment,” she added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, if you have a health issue, doctors underscore how important it is to be open and honest with your doctor about what you’re experiencing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

After all, you’re not getting a dose of high-fructose corn syrup hitting your blood sugar the way normal soda does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it’s still important to monitor how much you’re drinking. &lt;/span&gt;The rapper Fat Joe recently admitted to drinking between &lt;a href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/fat-joe-40-diet-soda-a-day" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="30 to 40 cans of Diet Pepsi per day" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.complex.com/music/a/jaelaniturnerwilliams/fat-joe-40-diet-soda-a-day" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;30 to 40 cans of Diet Pepsi per day&lt;/a&gt;, and that got us wondering: How much soda is too much&lt;span&gt; diet soda? To find out, we spoke with experts to learn what drinking too much diet soda can do to your body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, a look at the different types of artificial sweeteners in diet soda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Artificial sweeteners are made in a lab and plant-based ones come from natural sources,” said &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/founders-vanessa-rissetto/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Vanessa Rissetto" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://culinahealth.com/founders-vanessa-rissetto/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Vanessa Rissetto&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and CEO and co-founder of Culina Health. However, these are still processed. “They all vary in sweetness intensity, which is why only tiny amounts are used.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale&amp;amp;format=webp 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440&amp;amp;format=webp 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="img" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="auto" alt="Do you even know which type of artificial sweetener your favorite diet soda contains?" src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale" srcset="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale 1x, https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68b9e0ba1800006cf18c71c9.jpg?ops=scalefit_1440 2x"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Peter Dazeley via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Peter Dazeley via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Do you even know which type of artificial sweetener your favorite diet soda contains?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diet soda will usually be made with one or a mix of the following sweeteners, according to Rissetto: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aspartame: This is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar and breaks down into amino acids in the digestive system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sucralose: Made from sugar, but your body doesn’t process it as sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Saccharin: It is one of the oldest artificial sweeteners and is used as a substitute for sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K): This is often blended with other sweeteners to create a better taste. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevia: A plant-based option that has minimal impact on blood sugar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monk fruit: Another plant-based option that is often mixed with other sweeteners. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are any sweeteners better for you than others? “They’re all considered safe in normal amounts,” Rissetto said. “But some people prefer plant-based ones like stevia or monk fruit because they feel ‘more natural’ and they may have less impact on the gut microbiome.” While taste and tolerance are personal, there’s not one that is necessarily considered the healthiest option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpendulumlife.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Fmeet-our-new-chief-medical-officer-adam-perlman-md-mph%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooRZLofi6j_mI377PPSWTHqxqe6hX2xxs-sZVKjDMqyYETeRFfu" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Adam Perlman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=68adca4be4b07bd4ac5e63ce&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpendulumlife.com%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2Fmeet-our-new-chief-medical-officer-adam-perlman-md-mph%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooRZLofi6j_mI377PPSWTHqxqe6hX2xxs-sZVKjDMqyYETeRFfu" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Adam Perlman&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pendulum Therapeutics,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; said none of these sweeteners are considered “healthy,” but they may be gentler on your body. “Certain artificial sweeteners, like sucralose or saccharin, have been linked to changes in gut bacteria that could influence how your body manages blood sugar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happens To Your Body On Diet Soda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even without sugar, several cans a day have been tied to higher risks for type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke,” Perlman said. &lt;span&gt;“Over time, high intake may be linked to weight gain, heart problems and blood sugar issues.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to type 2 diabetes, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and saccharin have the ability to alter the way the body responds to glucose. “They stimulate sweet taste receptors, priming the body to expect calories,” Rissetto explained. “Over time, this mismatch can diminish insulin sensitivity, making it harder for the body to regulate blood sugar.” In addition to this, your gut bacteria can be altered by these sweeteners. This can “impair glucose metabolism and increase inflammation, which are both risk factors for type 2 diabetes,” Rissetto said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your body experiences changes in gut bacteria and insulin resistance, you may have a spike in systemic inflammation, “which is a core mechanism in heart disease,” Rissetto said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart disease can become a concern for those who drink too much diet soda because the hormonal and metabolic changes from artificial sweeteners can increase triglycerides and lower your “good” cholesterol, HDL, leading to endothelial dysfunction, which is when “chronic exposure to sweeteners and soda additives may damage blood vessel linings, raising blood pressure and atherosclerosis risk,” Rissetto said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your blood vessel health is compromised by frequent consumption of diet soda, there’s a chance you may be at a higher risk of small-vessel disease and impaired vascular function. Paired with the misconception that diet soda doesn’t cause much harm to the body because it doesn’t contain calories, “their biological effects can encourage weight gain, higher blood pressure and diabetes — all strong risk factors for stroke.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the rumor that artificial sweeteners cause you to consume more food?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Artificial sweeteners are also known to lead people to consume more sugar or other foods throughout the day. While they don’t deliver calories, your brain’s food reward pathways may get a little confused after drinking a diet soda. “The body expects energy after tasting sweetness — when it doesn’t get it, hunger signals may increase, driving more eating,” Rissetto explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your body also has a dopamine reward cycle, so when tasting something sweet, it triggers a dopamine release in the brain’s reward center. “Without actual energy intake, the ‘reward’ feels incomplete, pushing a person to snack more, especially on sugary or high-carb foods,” Rissetto added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, high intake may be linked to weight gain, heart problems and blood sugar issues,” Perlman said. “Some sweeteners can also change the makeup of your gut bacteria, which might affect metabolism and inflammation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without sugar, diet soda is acidic, so it’s possible that it can erode teeth. In addition to this, you have to consider how caffeine can affect your daily life. “Caffeine can cause jitters, headaches or sleep problems,” Rissetto said. “Some people get bloating or stomach discomfort from the carbonation or the sweeteners themselves. In certain people, it can increase cravings for sweet foods.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The average age at the start was 71, and just over half were women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were monitored for up to 15 years, with diet quality assessed repeatedly using food questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not put people on specific eating plans. Instead, researchers looked at the participants' normal diets and scored them according to how closely they resembled several recognised healthy patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mediterranean diet, traditional to southern Europe, centres on vegetables, fruit, wholegrains, beans, nuts, fish and olive oil, with little red meat or processed food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the MIND diet was created to protect brain health and combines elements of the Mediterranean approach with the DASH diet, which is designed to reduce blood pressure by lowering salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those with the unhealthiest diets – high in red and processed meat, such as bacon and sausages – developed brain and heart disease faster than their peers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Processed culinary ingredients - which are usually not eaten alone - include oils, butter, sugar and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MIND places particular emphasis on leafy greens and berries, as well as limiting fried food, butter and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), a scoring system developed by Harvard researchers to reflect the foods most consistently linked with reduced risk of major diseases, was also used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It rewards higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes and healthy fats, while penalising red and processed meat, sugary drinks and trans fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three diets were linked with slower build–up of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, a diet that scored highly on the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Index (EDII) – with large amounts of red meat, processed products and sugary drinks – was tied to faster disease accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers analysed not just single conditions but 'multimorbidity' – the total number of chronic illnesses someone lives with as they age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This included heart disease, dementia, depression, Parkinson's, diabetes, cancer and musculoskeletal problems such as arthritis or osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the follow-up, people with the healthiest diets had on average two to three fewer chronic diseases compared with those who scored lowest for diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15083749" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15083749/two-food-favorites-dementia-risk-15-year-study.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet was strongly linked to the build-up of cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric illnesses – which include dementia, Parkinson's disease and depression – but not to musculoskeletal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The protective effect of healthy eating patterns such as the Mediterranean and MIND diets was particularly marked among women and the 'oldest old' (those aged 78 and over).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-4e245ff0-8e2b-11f0-8493-f3b13c84e406" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15083749/two-food-favorites-dementia-risk-15-year-study.html"&gt;

reported that ultra-processed foods account for more than half the British diet and may be responsible for 18,000 premature deaths each year, linked to illnesses including diabetes, cancer, heart disease and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia now affects around one in 11 people over the age of 65 in the UK, with more than one million Britons expected to be living with the condition by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worldwide, cases are projected to almost triple to 150 million by 2050 as populations age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease and stroke remain two of the biggest killers, together accounting for around a quarter of all UK deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While death rates have fallen thanks to advances in treatment and prevention, the number of people living with the long–term disability these conditions cause is rising sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strokes in particular are now one of the leading causes of serious adult disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors said their findings add to a growing body of evidence that diet quality plays a key role in healthy ageing, potentially slowing the process of 'inflammaging' – the low–level inflammation that accumulates in the body with age and contributes to multiple diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added that the next step is to identify the dietary recommendations that could have the greatest impact on longevity, and the groups of older adults most likely to benefit, based on age, sex, social background and existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-ceaabfc0-8e2b-11f0-9816-9928f3d8a626" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15083749/two-food-favorites-dementia-risk-15-year-study.html"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT SHOULD A BALANCED DIET LOOK LIKE? &lt;/h3&gt;

Extensive burns are usually treated by transplanting a thin layer of epidermis, the top layer of skin, from elsewhere on the body. However, this method not only leaves large scars, it also does not restore the skin to its original functional state. Unless the dermis, the layer below the epidermis, which contains blood vessels and nerves, is regenerated, it cannot be considered normal living skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Now, work by Swedish researchers may have brought medicine closer to being able to regenerate living skin. They have developed two types of 3D bioprinting techniques to artificially generate thick skin that is vascularized, meaning it contains blood vessels. One technique produces skin that is packed with cells, and the other produces arbitrarily shaped blood vessels in the tissue. The two technologies take different approaches to the same challenge. The approaches have been outlined in &lt;a data-offer-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202501430" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202501430"}' href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202501430" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-offer-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502262" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502262"}' href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The dermis is so complicated that we can’t grow it in a lab. We don’t even know what all its components are,” said Johan Junker, an associate professor at Linköping University and a specialist in plastic surgery who led this work, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://liu.se/en/news-item/skin-in-a-syringe-a-step-towards-a-new-way-to-heal-burns" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://liu.se/en/news-item/skin-in-a-syringe-a-step-towards-a-new-way-to-heal-burns"}' href="https://liu.se/en/news-item/skin-in-a-syringe-a-step-towards-a-new-way-to-heal-burns" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s why we, and many others, think that we could possibly transplant the building blocks and then let the body make the dermis itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linköping team using a 3D bioprinter.&lt;/p&gt;

By building up this ink three-dimensionally using a 3D printer, they were able to create a skin structure filled with high-density cells at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a transplantation experiment using mice, the researchers confirmed that living cells grew inside tissue fragments made from this ink, secreting collagen and rebuilding the components of the dermis. New blood vessels also grew inside the graft, indicating that the conditions for long-term tissue fixation were met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Blood vessels play an extremely important role in the construction of artificial tissues. No matter how many cells are cultured to create a tissue model, without blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients cannot be carried evenly to all cells. And without blood vessels, as the tissue structure grows, the cells in the center of the tissue die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The research team has also created a technology called REFRESH (Rerouting of Free-Floating Suspended Hydrogel Filaments), which enables the flexible construction of blood vessels in artificial tissues by printing and arranging threads of a hydrogel that is 98 percent water. These threads are much tougher than ordinary gel materials and can maintain their shape even when tied or braided. Moreover, they also have shape-memory properties that allow them to return to their original shape even when crushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQVGl5STE3ZzJtYXg3SWVLMXF4OVJ5Z1ptd1p3ajNhWUUwdGVFelYwWVltazBUbUFRY1daWUE3c0dGZ0pBbE5GTWdTUXlDSV9oR091ZlJnZ1ptMktDQ2h4a25TeHRUdEItNHM0dHVhbjM0RGRfRlY2d256MFVacmhYOHVMZnhSa3NDT3MyWkdkb1Z3QjdxMjBkUzFOSzZMcFlIRlRkalF0cw</guid></item><item><title>有东西在摧毁佛罗里达的棕榈树。以下是需要注意的事项- WKMG</title><link>https://www.clickorlando.com/news/florida/2025/09/10/something-is-wiping-out-floridas-palm-trees-heres-what-to-watch-for/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Florida’s palm trees are being increasingly jeopardized thanks to a disease that’s spreading through the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;That’s according to UF/IFAS’ Larry Figart, an extension agent in urban forestry for the Duval County Extension Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/duvalco/2025/07/09/lethal-bronzing-a-palm-disease-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/duvalco/2025/07/09/lethal-bronzing-a-palm-disease-on-the-rise/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;

Florida's iconic palm trees are under attack from a fatal disease that turns them to dried crisps within months with no chance for recovery once ill. Lethal bronzing is caused by a bacteria spread by a rice-sized insect. It has gone from a small infestation on Florida's Gulf Coast to a statewide problem in a decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 hoaNsR"&gt; (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Instead, any tree properly diagnosed with LBD should be immediately removed to mitigate the chance that treehoppers spread the disease to other trees. Nearby palm trees should also be tested to ensure they don’t carry LBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;This was the case last month after Clearwater’s Coachman Park was forced to remove several of its palm trees after they became infected with LBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;“The good news (if you want to call it that) is that this disease cannot be spread by pruning tools, as is the case with other palm diseases,” Figart explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;To prevent infection, palm trees can be treated with doses of the antibiotic OTC, with repeated injections every three months. While effective, this treatment does create wounds in the trunk, which don’t heal in palm trees, Figart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 kNAFkD cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Another option that hasn’t been as thoroughly studied is to use a pesticide called “imidacloprid” on the root area of the tree, which is effective in killing planthoppers, Figart continues. This helps owners avoid wounding the trunk, though it comes with another downside, as the pesticide is harmful to bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 dJmKfw hTYOfq full-width" aria-labelledby=":Rrfon9a:" id="DHTM77RKJ5C6NFMOBVMWUUTI7E"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 bCvYh imageWrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption id=":Rrfon9a:" class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 jOjMik"&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 ewwUYq"&gt;FILE - In this July 1, 2015 file photo, Marvin Hernandez, right, and Kelly Vera sit in the shade of a palm tree, in Key Biscayne, Fla.

The stimulant, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants, is what makes cigarettes so addictive, with smoking responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-sgr-tobacco-related-health-disparities-exec-summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;490,000 American deaths each year&lt;/a&gt;. When people try to quit smoking, it’s often cravings for nicotine, and the surge of dopamine it releases in the brain, that foil their attempts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this sense, nicotine is responsible for many health problems. But public health experts say that while nicotine poses risks, some nicotine products are safer than cigarettes — and they worry popular misconceptions about the chemical’s effect on the body are doing more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5328980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of people in the U.S. wrongly believe that nicotine is the substance in cigarettes that causes cancer. In fact, “the harm from smoking comes from the burning of the ingredients in a cigarette, not from the nicotine itself,” said Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, a health policy researcher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. More than &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-components/chemicals-every-puff-cigarette-smoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;70 carcinogens&lt;/a&gt; have been identified in the cigarette smoke produced by the combustion of tobacco, which can damage people’s DNA and lay the groundwork for cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For many years, cigarettes were the main way that most Americans consumed nicotine. That meant it wasn’t a big problem from a public health perspective if people conflated the dangers of smoking with the dangers of that particular chemical, so long as that helped deter them from lighting up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, thanks to the more recent introductions of smoke-free options like e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, “we are in a totally different landscape when it comes to commercial nicotine products,” Hartmann-Boyce said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests pouches and vapes authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, while not risk-free, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/health-effects-tobacco-use/relative-risks-tobacco-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;significantly reduce&lt;/a&gt; people’s exposure to harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes. And tobacco researchers &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/17/vaping-chantix-compared-quit-smoking-study/"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2308815" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; e-cigarettes in particular as alternatives for people looking to quit cigarettes. Nicotine gum and patches, which are well-established tools for smoking cessation, carry even less risk. (Chewing tobacco, while smokeless, has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9308447/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;linked to oral cancers&lt;/a&gt; because it contains tobacco leaf, which means carcinogens in the leaf can be absorbed through the mouth. The e-liquids used in vapes, as well as nicotine pouches, gums, and patches, contain nicotine but not tobacco leaf.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem: “If you believe that nicotine causes cancer, not only are you going to be less likely to try to switch from smoking to e-cigs, you’re going to be less likely to try and use nicotine gum or nicotine patches or nicotine pouches,” said Jonathan Foulds, a professor at Penn State University’s Cancer Institute. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9356684/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Surveys from 2016 and 2018&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that daily smokers who believed nicotine products like patches and vapes were much less harmful than cigarettes were more likely to use those products when trying to quit smoking. Studies also suggest that people are more likely to quit smoking successfully with the help of &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub8/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;e-cigarettes that contain nicotine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6353172/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nicotine replacement therapies&lt;/a&gt; because they help ease withdrawal symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I did focus groups with young adults who smoke cigarettes, they talked about addiction being something that was a significant harm, and they did not want to trade one addiction for another by quitting cigarettes by using e-cigarettes, or quitting cigarettes using nicotine replacement therapy,” said Andrea Villanti, deputy director of the Rutgers Institute for Nicotine and Tobacco Studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue now faced by addiction and public health experts is how to correct the narrative about nicotine for the sake of harm reduction. They want people who smoke to know that switching to smoke-free nicotine products like vapes would likely benefit their health, without going so far as to encourage people who don’t currently use tobacco products from picking up a Zyn or Juul habit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent headlines suggest there is potential for nicotine’s reputation to tip in the opposite direction. An &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/06/nicotine-gum-patch-cigarettes-cognitive-benefits-research.html?pay=1756917976343&amp;amp;support_journalism=please" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;article in Slate&lt;/a&gt; explored early research on nicotine as a treatment for people with long Covid dealing with brain fog. Meanwhile, social media users touting Zyn nicotine pouches as “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/im-a-doctor-heres-why-you-shouldnt-lose-weight-using-zyn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gas station Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;” say it helps with weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Recovering nicotine’s reputation would also provide a clear commercial benefit to tobacco companies, many of which are betting on smoke-free products as their future given &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224992860/tobacco-smoking-vaping-global-health-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;global declines&lt;/a&gt; in smoking rates. Philip Morris International’s Stacey Kennedy, head of the company’s U.S. division, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/30/trump-zyn-rfk-jr-nicotine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Axios&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that the substance, while addictive, had some “cognitive benefits.” Other kinds of businesses may also be looking to get on the bandwagon: The company Nic and Jet Fuel &lt;a href="https://nicandjetfuel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently announced a line of energy drinks&lt;/a&gt; with “microdosed nicotine to boost focus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s reason to be concerned about nicotine getting situated within the world of wellness, said Olivia Wackowski, an associate professor at Rutgers School of Public Health. History is replete with examples of companies marketing light, low-tar, or “natural” cigarettes, like Natural American Spirits, in ways that have created &lt;a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/e1/e61" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;misperceptions&lt;/a&gt; about them as lower-risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s a health tonic,” said Villanti, noting that the conversation about nicotine needs to have nuance. “The priority is really educating people about nicotine rather than repackaging it as a healthy product.”&lt;/p&gt;

Santiago/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-about-nicotine"&gt;What we know about nicotine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anti-tobacco organizations &lt;a href="https://truthinitiative.org/research-resources/harmful-effects-tobacco/nicotine-and-young-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tend&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/what-we-do/industry-watch/e-cigarettes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;take a firm stance&lt;/a&gt; against nicotine, emphasizing its impact on adolescent brain development. Indisputably, nicotine use comes with real risks. Women who use smokeless tobacco while pregnant have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11450978/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;babies with lower birth weights&lt;/a&gt; than women who do not use nicotine, and research in mice suggests vaping while pregnant may also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001216062300101X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hurt babies’ lung development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The substance is also highly addictive, particularly for people who start using it at a young age. But it &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/ready-to-quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/vaping-myths-and-the-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;doesn’t directly cause&lt;/a&gt; the cancer associated with smoking, and when it comes to questions about whether nicotine causes other serious differences in brain development, “the jury is definitely still out,” said Hartmann-Boyce. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Foulds, the evidence that nicotine is harmful to the developing brain is of about the same quality as evidence on the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/13/energy-drinks-embrace-wellness-branding-experts-say-obscures-health-risks-high-caffeine-intake/"&gt;impact of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; on young people. Both are stimulants that may plausibly have an adverse effect on brain development, he said. “But the same people who are out there saying nicotine causes brain damage, they’re giving their kids pocket money to putt around to Starbucks and buy whatever they like.” (In a sign of growing concerns about the health effects of caffeine on young people, the U.K. recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/world/europe/uk-energy-drinks-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to join a growing number of countries in banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under 16.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no easy task to change popular misunderstandings about nicotine at a time when Americans are suspicious of health information shared by both the tobacco industry and the government, Hartmann-Boyce said. “So who is a trusted knowledge broker in that situation?” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One solution is to educate physicians — &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791164" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than 60% of whom&lt;/a&gt; believe that all tobacco products are equally harmful — about nicotine. Research shows that healthcare providers are consistently rated as the most credible source of information on tobacco and health, said Wackowski. Position statements from health organizations like the American Heart Association or the American Medical Association would help too, she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better public communication about the effects of nicotine could also help ward off confusion about low-nicotine cigarettes, which would become a particularly pressing issue if the U.S. ever acts on a Biden-era &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/15/fda-proposes-lower-nicotine-levels-in-cigarettes-reduce-smoking-related-deaths-diseases/"&gt;Food and Drug Administration proposal&lt;/a&gt; to curb levels of the ingredient. The goal of the rule change would be to make cigarettes less addictive. But researchers warn that if people think, inaccurately, that lower-nicotine cigarettes pose a lower risk of cancer, they might not be motivated to reduce their smoking in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t start correcting public perceptions on nicotine, we could have a situation where someone would think that a cigarette with very low nicotine is going to be less harmful to them than a nicotine pouch,” said Hartmann-Boyce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Differentiating between the risks of nicotine addiction and the risks of combustible tobacco isn’t a simple message to convey. But Wackowski and Villanti both say &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37989586/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that more comprehensive approaches that take time to walk people through the science on the underlying causes of tobacco’s harms are most effective in reducing false beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We try to tell more of the story,” said Villanti. “I think that was important in helping people understand that bigger picture and challenging their beliefs.” &lt;/p&gt;

"It started off as a third-leading cause and, in 2024, we see that it's not ranked at all, actually. So, it's still among the 15 leading causes, but not in the top 10."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Sharonne Hayes, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, agreed that fewer cases of COVID-19 are likely driving the reduction in mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think there's a little less COVID, right? I mean, that's part of it," she told ABC News. "I think that the pandemic was such a time of both COVID-related deaths, but also just rising risk factors, particularly around cardiovascular disease, people's lifestyles were less healthy.

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time obesity has overtaken &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/global-food-security/t-19020431"&gt;undernourishment&lt;/a&gt; as the leading form of malnutrition among children aged five to 19, according to the report released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, "when we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children," UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said in a statement on the &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/obesity-exceeds-underweight-first-time-among-school-age-children-and-adolescents" title="External link — report's release."&gt;report's release.&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did the report say about undernourishment and obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of underweight children has dropped from nearly 13% to 9.2%, among 5- to 19-year olds, according to data collected in over 190 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, obesity rates have nearly tripled from 3% to 9.4% during the same period. The report suggests one in five children aged five to 19 years are overweight, totalling some 391 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "tipping point" was predicted by UNICEF back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions globally except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Many high-income countries continue to have high levels of obesity, including 27% of 5- to 19-year-olds in Chile, 21% in the US and 21% in the UAE, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Don't let obesity take you down" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Don't let obesity take you down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-67517715" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67517715" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/67517935_605.webp" data-duration="05:33"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2023/beng231122_77peeng231122_healthy_me_obesity_3_01smw_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2023/beng231122_77peeng231122_healthy_me_obesity_3_01smw_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is causing the rise in obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers at UNICEF, the rising trend of obesity is largely due to unhealthy food environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report warned that "ultra-processed and fast foods – high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives – are shaping children's diets through unhealthy food environments, rather than personal choice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children," Russell said in the statement. "Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children's growth, cognitive development and mental health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To curb the rising trend of obesity, the report included suggestions such as improving the food environment by including food labelling, implementing food marketing restrictions and banning the provision or sale of ultra-processed and junk foods in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also suggested firming up social protection programs to address income poverty and improve financial access to nutritious diets.&lt;/p&gt;

            The death rate in the United States returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2024 as Covid-19 fell out of the top 10 leading causes of death, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr039.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm00043b6nna4mqh2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 quickly rose to the third leading cause of death in the US in the first two years of the pandemic, pushing the age-adjusted death rate up to a peak of about 880 deaths for every 100,000 people in 2021. The overall US death rate has fallen about 18% since then, and last year’s 4% drop brought the US death rate down to the lowest it’s been since 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm00053b6nd7hndc6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 722 deaths for every 100,000 people in the US in 2024 – nearly 3.1 million deaths overall – according to the provisional, age-adjusted data from the CDC. Final mortality data may change, but the latest data are based on 99.9% of all 2024 death records received and processed by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics as of June 1, 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm00063b6nwc65c4j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heart disease and cancer remained the leading causes of death, accounting for more than 40% of all deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm00073b6ngen7c118@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And despite an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/drug-overdose-deaths-decline-us-2024"&gt;unprecedented drop in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, drug overdoses and other unintentional injuries were the third leading cause of death in the US for the third year in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm00083b6n31gwdeth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2022 and the tenth in 2023, according to CDC data. There were still &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;tens of thousands of Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the US last year, but suicide moved up to the tenth leading cause of death – with nearly 49,000 lives lost in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm00093b6nbpidzh2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suicide mortality reached a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/29/health/suicide-record-high-2022-cdc"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; in the US 2022 and has decreased only slightly in the years since. Millions of people have called, texted, or sent chats to the 988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline since mid-2022; about a tenth of those individuals who reached were routed to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/health/988-lgbtq-youth-services-end-wellness"&gt;specialized subnetwork for LGBTQ+ youth&lt;/a&gt;, but the Trump administration ended that service in July.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Death rates decreased for most age groups in 2024, the new CDC report shows, but held steady for children ages 5 to 14 and for infants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Infant mortality had been trending down in the US for decades before &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/health/infant-mortality-increase-2022-cdc"&gt;spiking in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and the new CDC report shows that the infant mortality rate has still not recovered. Nearly 20,000 babies died before they turned 1 in 2024 – about 5.5 deaths for every 1,000 infants. In August, the Mississippi health department declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/infant-mortality-public-health-emergency-mississippi"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; over rising infant mortality rates in the state.

            Age-adjusted death rates decreased for all race and ethnicity groups in 2024 but vast disparities remain. Rates were highest among the Black population, with more 924 deaths for every 100,000 Black people in the US – 28% higher than the overall rate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfd1ayhm000d3b6nc9l4e84p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deaths decreased among both men and women in the US in 2024, but the rate was significantly lower among women than it was for men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This is shown by a new study from Karolinska Institutet published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have investigated how four different diets affect the accumulation of chronic diseases in older adults. Three of the diets studied were healthy and focused on the intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats and reduced intake of sweets, red meat, processed meat and butter/margarine. The fourth diet, however, was pro-inflammatory and focused on red and processed meat, refined grains and sweetened beverages, with lower intake of vegetables, tea and coffee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over 2,400 older adults in Sweden were followed for 15 years. The researchers discovered that those who followed the healthy diets had a slower development of chronic diseases. This applied to cardiovascular disease and dementia, but not to diseases related to muscles and bones. Those who followed the pro-inflammatory diet, on the other hand, increased their risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results show how important diet is in influencing the development of multimorbidity in aging populations," says co-first author Adrián Carballo-Casla, postdoctoral researcher at the Aging Research Centre, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in their research is to identify the dietary recommendations that may have the greatest impact on longevity and the groups of older adults who may benefit most from them, based on their age, gender, psychosocial background and chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR) and the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, FORTE, among others. The researchers state that there are no conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facts about the diets:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay)&lt;/strong&gt;: A diet designed for brain health and to reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AHEI (Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/strong&gt;): A diet that measures adherence to dietary guidelines that reduce the risk of chronic diseases in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMED (Alternative Mediterranean Diet&lt;/strong&gt;): A modified version of the Mediterranean diet adapted to Western eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDII (Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Index)&lt;/strong&gt;: An index that estimates the inflammatory risks of a diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
