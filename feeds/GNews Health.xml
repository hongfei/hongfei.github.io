	A new &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5199076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; models the impact of the implosion of U.S.-funded &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/disease/" id="auto-tag_disease" data-tag="disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; treatment and prevention in the developing world — and suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/" id="auto-tag_elon-musk" data-tag="elon-musk"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/marco-rubio/" id="auto-tag_marco-rubio" data-tag="marco-rubio"&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; will go down as among history’s greatest monsters if funding and effective administration are not restored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In short: Tens of millions will die, millions of them children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The second Trump administration began by &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/u-s-foreign-aid-freeze-dissolution-of-usaid-timeline-of-events/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;driving a stake&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-interview-usaid-humanitarian-collapse-1235259251/"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt; of America’s foreign aid programs. Led by Musk, and enabled by Secretary of State Rubio, the U.S. Agency for International Development (&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/usaid/" id="auto-tag_usaid" data-tag="usaid"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;) has been shuttered, and its life-saving programs in global health either defunded or thrown into disarray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The new paper is not yet finalized or peer-reviewed; it was published as part of a project called &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5199076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preprints with The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But it offers a first glimpse of the potential impact of the Trump administration’s cut-and-run approach to foreign aid — fueled by lies and red-pill conspiracy theories promoted by Musk about USAID being a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1896930796310806835" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;radical left&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886102414194835755?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;criminal&lt;/a&gt;” organization that deserved to be sent through the “&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1886307316804263979?lang=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wood chipper&lt;/a&gt;.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The study models the collapse of nearly $13 billion in U.S. funding for health programs in developing countries, including for the treatment and prevention of &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hiv/" id="auto-tag_hiv" data-tag="hiv"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and tuberculosis; family planning; and maternal and child health. It forecasts the increase in global death and suffering through 2040 if this funding — which accounts for nearly a quarter of global donor investment — is zeroed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The findings shock the conscience. Cessation of U.S. aid will lead to people in poor countries dying, in genocidal proportions, of preventable and treatable diseases. That includes more than 15 million additional deaths from HIV/&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/aids/" id="auto-tag_aids" data-tag="aids"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2 million additional casualties from tuberculosis, and nearly 8 million additional children dead of other maladies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The impact on family planning is similarly stark — with tens of millions of new unplanned pregnancies (ranging between 40-55 million). Counter to the administration’s stated “pro-life” agenda, the collapse of American aid is projected to lead to as many as 16 million “unsafe abortions.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to the study, this mass suffering would be avoided by continuing U.S. funding on a “status quo” level from 2024 commitments. (Current funding for these programs represents about 0.2 percent of America’s &lt;a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;$6.75 trillion&lt;/a&gt; in annual federal spending.)

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The deadliest projected impact comes from the hobbling of PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — an enormous humanitarian accomplishment of the George W. Bush presidency that has made anti-retroviral medication widely available in the developing world, particularly in African countries hardest hit by HIV. The program has been credited with &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar-latest-global-results-factsheet-dec-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;saving tens of millions of lives&lt;/a&gt; and preventing HIV transmission to nearly 8 million children since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The GOP-led Congress shares blame here, too. PEPFAR’s authorization &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-misses-reauthorization-deadline-whats-next-global-hiv-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;expired&lt;/a&gt; in March, and the current Congress has &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/pepfar-misses-reauthorization-deadline-whats-next-global-hiv-fight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;provided funding&lt;/a&gt; only through September — throwing the entire program’s future into doubt. Regardless of appropriated funds, however, the chaotic governance of Trump, Musk, and Rubio has monkey-wrenched the program on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	PEPFAR was supposed to be exempt from a 90-day funding “pause” the administration imposed on most foreign aid, but USAID administered a majority of PEPFAR aid and the agency now no longer exists, with its chipped remains being swept into the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/state-department/" id="auto-tag_state-department" data-tag="state-department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;. International partners on the ground in places like South Africa have likened the Trump-Musk era to being &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77887npl2mo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;“pushed off a cliff.”&lt;/a&gt; The George W. Bush Presidential Center has blasted the new administration for having “&lt;a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/two-minute-take-pepfar-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;gravely undermined PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The future of U.S. funding to prevent and treat tuberculosis, as well child and maternal health programs, is similarly uncertain. (By one estimate, a Trump freeze on TB funding has already killed &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/health/tuberculosis-impact-usaid-funding-intl-scli/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;11,000 people&lt;/a&gt;.) This gutting of medical aid comes atop the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/usaid-doge-children-starvation/682484/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;deadly havoc&lt;/a&gt; caused by the suspension of food aid to relieve famine in the world’s poorest countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The authors of the preprint paper are stark in their warning about the impact of continued cuts, insisting that a U.S. withdrawal from its 2024 commitments “would reverse decades of progress in global health” and send levels of deaths and disease soaring to levels not seen since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Stimulating either of a pair of crucial nerves that carry messages from the brain to several major organs could be an effective way to treat people with severe  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers conducted a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; on 493 adults whose major depression hadn't previously &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-depression-changes-the-very-structure-of-the-brain-scientists-find"&gt;responded to treatment&lt;/a&gt;. Participants were fitted with a device capable of stimulating one of their vagus nerves, which was then activated in half the group to transmit signals to areas of their brain that regulate moods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessments were carried out for roughly ten months, after which participants who received the stimulation treatment showed improvements in their &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, in their quality of life, and in their ability to carry out the daily tasks of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve.jpg" alt="Vagus nerves" class="wp-image-147563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/VagusNerve-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There are left and right vagus nerves in our bodies. (Benote/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On average, each patient had already tried 13 treatments that failed to help them before they enrolled in the trial, and they had spent more than half of their lives sick with depression," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But despite that super-high level of sustained illness, we still see  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="158509" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt;, measurable improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While VNS &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; promise for treating depression before, evidence of its success &lt;a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(05)00620-7/abstract"&gt;hasn't always&lt;/a&gt; been clear cut, leaving treatment difficult to afford for many in the US on insurance cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some reasons to be cautious. Based on the study's primary measure of depressive symptoms, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), there were no differences between the treatment and non-treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few participants from either group reported a full remission in their depression, and it's also worth noting the study was partly funded and supported by LivaNova USA, which manufactures a VNS therapy system for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats in mind though, the study's results are promising, particularly when it comes to helping people escape the mental paralysis that can come along with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158511" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown.jpg" alt="Vagus Nerve Stimulation Shows Lasting Effects in People With Severe Depression" class="size-full wp-image-158511" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/DepressedManLyingDown-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158511" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mental paralysis can occur with major depression. (Marjan_Apostolovic/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's really important here is that patients themselves were reporting that their lives were improving," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Conway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're saying they are seeing meaningful improvements in their ability to function and live their lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21120"&gt;Up to 30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of those with severe depression fail to benefit from standard antidepressants, with their mental health problems compounded by an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032717324096"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/impact-treatment-resistant-depression-health-care/"&gt;hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.21120"&gt;disability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145981" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642.jpg" alt="A women takes a pill" class="wp-image-145981 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642-530x415.jpg 530w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TakingAPillWithWater642-600x470.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145981" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Up to 30 percent of those with severe depression fail to benefit from standard antidepressants.

In addition, the researchers want to continue the trial for another four years, and see if the benefits are particularly noticeable in certain groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The nice thing about vagus nerve stimulation, we know from other studies, is that when the patient responds, the effects usually stick," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/vagus-nerve-stimulation-relieves-severe-depression/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Conway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in two papers in &lt;a href="https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Stimulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(24)01390-1/fulltext"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(24)01382-2/fulltext"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2025. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

												&lt;p&gt;Ryo Tatsuki, a Japanese manga artist known as “Japan’s Baba Vanga,” gained attention for predicting the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in her 1999 comic The Future As I See It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wrote about an unknown virus emerging around 2020, reaching its peak in April. This prediction closely matched the real outbreak that began in late 2019 and peaked with deadly waves in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same comic, Tatsuki warned that the virus would disappear but return about ten years later, suggesting a possible comeback around 2030. As this year approaches, her forecast is being discussed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not confirmed by science, the comic has stirred curiosity, especially as experts remain alert to new health threats around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Tatsuki receives her visions through dreams, health experts are focused on real risks like “Disease X,” H5N1 bird flu, and other global viruses. Preparations for future pandemics are already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When speech pathologist Vanessa Abraham began to feel ill in 2019, she thought she had a bad case of the flu. She was exhausted and her body ached. Her voice was raspy. She was prescribed antibiotics, but they didn't help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, Abraham woke up in the middle of the night and tried to stand. She collapsed to the floor, struggling to breathe. Her husband took her to an area hospital, where Abraham was taken to the ICU and intubated. The ventilator helped her breathe but left her unable to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors didn't know what was causing her symptoms. Two days after being admitted, she was transferred to UC San Diego Health, a larger hospital. That's where she met Dr. Jared Rosen, then a medical student on an ICU rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Abraham was in the ICU, doctors suggested multiple diagnoses, but none fit. Even scarier than the lack of answers was her continued intubation. She was unable to speak or eat. She was fighting paralysis that left her unable to move much of her body. Her neck was so weak that she couldn't raise her head without it flopping like a newborn baby's, Rosen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was very aware of what was going on," Abraham told CBS News. "It was beyond the worst experience I could have ever imagined myself being in."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham said the only thing that helped relieve her anxiety during this time was the long hours Rosen would spend at her bedside, doing his best to keep her spirits up. As a medical student, he had fewer responsibilities than other members of her care team and was able to spend more time with Abraham. They also worked to develop communication methods Abraham could use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several weeks, Abraham's symptoms began to improve. She was taken off the ventilator. After a month, she was released from the ICU. But doctors were still no closer to understanding what had caused her paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no official label or term for what I was having. The fear of not knowing was terrifying," Abraham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosing a rare form of an unusual condition &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being discharged from the ICU, Abraham still had weakness that left her unable to lift her right arm and made eating difficult, so she spent time in inpatient physical therapy. Even after that, she needed outpatient follow-up, as well as more specialized care like swallowing and voice therapy. She battled severe anxiety and depression. At times, she felt so overwhelmed that she considered taking her own life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;
    
                                    
      &lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/18/8df396ab-07d5-4bb3-a59f-bd82e7288719/thumbnail/1240x930/b7de61408d0c723b1095ddba34d777b4/vanessa-rehab-2.png?v=04a4ba26f526ed8207f014fe1018c4aa#" alt="vanessa-rehab-2.png " loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      
          &lt;figcaption class="embed__caption-container"&gt;

                Vanessa Abraham

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, she searched for Rosen online and found his email address. Abraham wrote and asked if he remembered her. When he responded and said that he did, it "brought tears" to her eyes and "sparked some level of joy" that helped her have hope. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That hope carried her through the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, four months after her symptoms began, Abraham was diagnosed with a form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder where the fibers around the nerves deteriorate and cause paralysis. In most cases, the paralysis starts in the legs and works its way upwards, according to Dr. Kiril Kiprovski, a neurologist and director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at NYU Langone. Abraham had contracted the condition's even rarer pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, which attacks the muscles in the diaphragm and throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant is "very difficult to diagnose," Kiprovski said. There's no one test to determine if a person has Guillain-Barré syndrome or any of its variants, so doctors rely on clinical presentations. But they may not be familiar with the condition, Kiprovski said, because of its rarity. One person per 78,000 is diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome annually, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15838-guillain-barre-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Only about 3% of those patients are diagnosed with the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant, researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6472218/#ref2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome or a variant of it tend to improve on their own, as Abraham did, Kiprovski said. Once Abraham was diagnosed, she was able to start receiving intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, where donor antibodies are given to a patient to strengthen their immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"It takes time"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham continued her slow recovery. Having a name for what was happening to her helped her accept the laborious process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to accept in my own head that this is going to be something that's just going to take time," Abraham said. "And that's how neuro diseases work. It takes time for your body to regenerate and heal." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;
    
                                    
      &lt;span class="img embed__content"&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/18/357cf7aa-2c79-4253-8c15-64698ad1d03a/thumbnail/1240x1860/298334ca89e568c39b7e2b3925b7f242/vanessa.jpg?v=04a4ba26f526ed8207f014fe1018c4aa#" alt="vanessa.jpg " loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, Abraham still has neuromuscular weakness, but can go about much more of her daily routine. She is back at work, where her voiceless experience in the ICU informs her interactions with patients whose speech has been compromised. She spends as much time as possible in the gym, working to strengthen her body. She also stayed in touch with Rosen, who is now finishing a fellowship in critical care medicine at the University of California's Davis Medical Center. He told CBS News that Abraham's case inspired him to study that area of medicine. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham's recovery hasn't just been physical. She started attending a support group for people who have trauma after time in the ICU. The experience has helped her recover from the fear of those weeks on a ventilator. She has worked to raise awareness for the benefits of such groups. She also wrote a memoir detailing her experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so much more to recovery than just getting strong again," Abraham said. &lt;/p&gt;

She did. “It just came out of nowhere,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3QYDKWNEQZGYVL6QAUUSXKHDKA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton, now 43, a software marketer in Boston, went to an ear, nose and throat specialist who told him he had a deviated septum, a common condition when the cartilage and the septum — the bone partition separating the nostrils — is “off center.” He recommended corrective surgery, and Rhoton agreed. The doctor also suggested a second procedure at the same time, a near-total removal of a turbinate in each nostril. Turbinates are small structures — three on each side — that cleanse, warm and humidify the air when it is drawn into the nose. But they can become inflamed and enlarged — the case with Rhoton — and doctors sometimes reduce or remove them to improve breathing when sprays and other measures are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAV4NPTVJZE23KLQP35J4AUV2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor told Rhoton that the surgery was routine and low-risk. He had no idea that instead of breathing better, the opposite would occur, prompting life-altering symptoms — constant nasal congestion, sleep disturbances, crushing fatigue and brain fog, anxiety, and weight gain. It took nearly six years and visits to 17 doctors, some of whom told him he was imagining things, before one of them finally identified the problem and offered a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5C4PJF3JP5GKHLC2ARV73SD4LE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“My symptoms made daily life a struggle simply to function,” he says. “It’s hard to believe that it took so many doctors and so much time to figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DF5Z5VPWEZCZ5BKWHNKEHDLBOY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DF5Z5VPWEZCZ5BKWHNKEHDLBOY"&gt;Congestion, burning and no sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQBSSZVQDFAL3PMTIRR4TLPTAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton’s initial surgery took place in April 2018. The doctor corrected the septum and removed most of the “inferior” turbinate — the largest of the three — from each nostril. &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-treatments/n/nasal-surgery/types/turbinate-reduction.html#:~:text=Turbinates%20are%20small%20structures%20inside%20the%20nose,passes%20through%20the%20nostrils%20into%20the%20lungs."&gt;Turbinate reduction&lt;/a&gt; is a common  procedure used to improve airflow, with a success rate of 82 percent, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XSBUENOKVDSJHRMYBIQ2NA6YY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the course of three months, Rhoton developed a worsening cascade of symptoms. He felt like he could no longer breathe through his nose. His nasal passages became congested and crusted, with a nagging burning sensation. “I felt like I was suffocating,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M6Y4AEQDLNAI7PNBUKHYF7KW3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He had to breathe through his mouth, almost like he had a persistent cold that wouldn’t go away. He couldn’t sleep and became extremely sleepy during the day. The constant fatigue left him with no energy or motivation. He became anxious and started eating junk food. He gained weight. And, to his frustration, the whistling resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="TGXPV5MW2NBIFOCIIWH3VRPM5Y" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“I felt like I was suffocating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Bradley Rhoton&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="62Y3FZ4H55BLVKMURBTY22WWX4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most distressingly, he felt too tired to play with his sons, now 5 and 2. “It was like I was on a two-hour battery,” he says. “I wanted to do fun things with my kids, but I was so diminished that I couldn’t care for them. I’d fall asleep in the lawn chair while I was supposed to be watching them play outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM5OYPVNYVAPVMFEVGCUYFGV44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He’d never had sleeping problems, but now he’d nod off during work because he couldn’t sleep at night. “I’d be on a call and fall asleep,” he says. “The person on the other end of the phone would ask: ‘Bradley, are you there?’ and I played it like it was a poor connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HQXOWRJAOFGV5P6JVLPMLCMOW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He tried nasal sprays and other decongestants, saline irrigation, allergy medications, and antihistamines. None worked. He returned to the ENT doctor in October, who found a small hole in his septum, which he repaired, but Rhoton’s symptoms did not improve. In May, he had a small benign growth removed from one of his nostrils. That didn’t help, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q45PVMGNQRCTBJGCO6NKK623OM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Frustrated, over the next 18 months he sought help from other doctors, including his primary care physician and two new ENT specialists. “They told me my nose looked fine,” he says. “They said: ‘Your nose is wide open.

There’s nothing wrong with you.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="FVN2G7PTNNCMPBVP5YSEEK3IRI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="FVN2G7PTNNCMPBVP5YSEEK3IRI"&gt;All in his head, sleep apnea?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSR3KPXMRBCH5GASXUQF2RQIJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He began to wonder if some of the specialists he’d seen were right that “it was all in my head,” even though he’d expected the original surgery to go well and was surprised by the ensuing symptoms. He found it vexing that no one took his symptoms seriously. “It was an upsetting journey that raised questions about how the health-care system responds and the often overlooked psychological toll of being medically misunderstood,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3A7YAE6MIJG4DOVRK6ER6QCUQY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rhoton considered the possibility that his breathing problems — which at times were so bad that he couldn’t go out with friends, exercise or engage in his favorite hobbies, such as photography or playing hockey — actually might be unrelated to his nose and the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGDPQGC7DFD3BGTXQLHR2TZ6IE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He saw a sleep specialist, thinking perhaps a sleep disorder was causing his disrupted sleep. The doctor diagnosed him with mild &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; and recommended  a &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cpap#What-is-CPAP?"&gt;CPAP machine&lt;/a&gt;, which helps keep a person’s airways open, at night. He tried  but couldn’t stick with it because wearing a mask over his nose and mouth exacerbated his symptoms, and he felt like he was gasping for air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="F2ULMDD7ZBG63HOHZ3GMNUMOHY" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“It can be incredibly impactful to their well-being, their quality of life, including to their mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Pryor Brenner, Washington, D.C., otolaryngologist &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="23NCTBQCPBHLLOXGMGIPEHFGNI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He then went to a cardiologist, who gave him a stress test and drew blood for lab work.

Das said he could not diagnose  Rhoton from afar, but the two discussed several possibilities, including a rare and debilitating disorder that sometimes occurs after turbinate surgery: “&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23170-empty-nose-syndrome"&gt;empty nose syndrome&lt;/a&gt;,” in which patients develop relentless and severe nasal congestion and significantly restricted breathing through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H34RV7CSVFBLPNBUAG6HFLLB2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;ENS is not a well-understood disorder and is a somewhat controversial diagnosis because of its counterintuitive nature, since turbinate surgery is meant to improve breathing, not make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AHM2EVSUTNF57MNCLPXZEAWCWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear why some patients experience breathing problems following turbinate surgery, while most do not. Some experts think that anatomical differences among patients may play a role. Regardless, “it’s real,” says Pryor Brenner, a D.C. otolaryngologist who has seen only two ENS cases in 24 years among the more than 2,000 nasal surgeries he’s performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HJSVVEC55EDPPI4WVZZ2ZZ7ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I discuss the possibility of ENS with all my patients because it’s a major medical problem when it does occur,” he adds. “It can be incredibly impactful to their well-being, their quality of life, including to their mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SCRPLMLXTZE5RMOPMGUDGPIMQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some experts believe that ENS results from the loss during surgery of important turbinate tissue receptors that signal normal airflow. With key receptors gone, some “patients feel like they can’t breathe,” says Eugene Kern, clinical professor in the department of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at the State University of New York at Buffalo. “They have to breathe through the mouth. You no longer get the feeling of normal breathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BXJ34UFKKJCXBEU36YRTZOR2JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kern identified the syndrome with a colleague in 1994 while working at the Mayo Clinic  and coined the name. He believes ENS occurs more frequently than known, although there are no reliable estimates available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HH4Z6IOA5FRFN54GXD3KIPSSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While at Mayo, Kern treated nearly 250 ENS patients, all of whom had undergone turbinate surgery elsewhere. “I was seeing four or five patients a week,” Kern says, adding that it goes undiagnosed because many doctors “don’t understand the mechanism. It’s easy to diagnose when you know what you are looking for. You can’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HADLCSL3YNHLHOJQU4NB6327XQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HADLCSL3YNHLHOJQU4NB6327XQ"&gt;A reason for hope&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5HKNDBFHHVD6TLWZAIVMIHPNYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After talking with Das, Rhoton felt certain he was suffering from ENS. “Suddenly it all made sense,” he recalls. Das suggested Rhoton contact Jayakar Nayak, an ENT surgeon at Stanford University, who was using several effective novel treatment approaches and was also in Rhoton’s health insurance network. Nayak had published research articles on the condition and had a podcast about ENS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQ7WPQDGJFBSRCNJOGPG55RVFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This provided me with something I hadn’t felt in years,” Rhoton says. “Hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y4FHQZRF65F4LFVQJDW7CJMWHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nayak, an expert in nasal and sinus disorders, says he has performed thousands of inferior turbinate reduction surgeries for nasal congestion over the years with no ill aftereffects, but acknowledges that problems can occur sporadically, making a diagnosis perplexing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LAM6QVT4FFWBIXUZFQSFUFBDY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Inferior turbinate reduction for abnormally enlarged and obstructing turbinate tissue is a remarkably safe and effective procedure to help patients to breathe and sleep better,” he says, and unfortunately “we don’t know why ENS happens in a small group of people and not in others. I’ve seen similar levels of tissue loss in other patients who don’t have any ENS symptoms and are so happy with their breathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SBMBWS3TKJHMVB7A4MXBI4L4CU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He also has received hundreds of referrals over the years to evaluate symptomatic patients for ENS, but only a fraction turn out to have the disorder, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66UMDVMDMBCZDLG52A2JBFRKVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Rhoton’s case, because his symptoms occurred right after the surgery, ENS was a likely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5NKNXWTXJFORGLJMSW6UKDGDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To confirm this, Nayak ran a series of tests when Rhoton came to see him last June. “We have a scoring system that lists the common symptoms of ENS with a maximum score of 30, with 30 being the worst,” Nayak recalls. “Bradley’s score was 26.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BF3OAWVVIJADVHGN2HF2HYVWYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctor performed a second diagnostic test by inserting cotton into various areas of Rhoton’s nose. When the cotton was placed in nostril areas where tissue was missing, “he was breathing like a normal person. He went from 26 to 2 on the scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YOIO77FWC5FLPL4IOJJP4FM6BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nayak recalls that Rhoton “was so pleased, he was almost crying. He told me that ‘whatever you just did, just leave it be. I finally can breathe through my nose again.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A752FGIYLRBBNFQJL3A7KVRU6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next step was a series of injections — four or five in each nostril — with a gel made of carboxymethyl cellulose, a filler used in many pharmaceutical products. Although the temporary filler does not restore lost nerves and receptors or last forever, it improves airflow. A permanent solution for those who appear to be good candidates is surgery to implant rib cartilage (sanitized and irradiated material taken from cadaver sources) into nasal passages to replace missing turbinate tissue. While not a complete cure, it significantly reduces symptoms, Nayak’s research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QC66HHKPKZE3TMISHD2X6NYMYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last September, Rhoton got the injections and improved substantially in the month that followed. “I could breathe through my nose. I could sleep. My mood improved. I felt motivated,” he says. “The difference was amazing.” He has had a follow-up series of injections when his breathing worsened again and is now leaning toward having the surgery, probably in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="73JESQUQGRBF7PYALGQGV7UHNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And, he says, “I’m hopeful for the first time in nearly six years.

   &lt;p&gt;If you feel like your seasonal allergies are getting worse every year, it's not just you. Warming from climate change is making the pollen season longer, and more people are going to the doctor each year looking for relief, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/lary.32124" target="_blank"&gt;research review&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;The Laryngoscope. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One study the reviewers looked at found the pollen season had already gotten 20 days longer in North America between 1990 and 2018, and several studies found an increase in average daily pollen concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are ways to keep the pollen from taking over your life. NPR asked doctors for tips to help you manage your spring allergies before they manage you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Want more stories on the science of healthy living? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/newsletter/health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep the outside outside &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pollen can be carried in on just about any surface, warns Dr. Zachary Rubin a pediatric allergist and clinical immunologist who &lt;a href="https://drrubin.substack.com/" target="_blank"&gt;blogs about allergies&lt;/a&gt; and shares &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/rubin_allergy?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAadZB16VfI48t4rNxPpq8LGfLlXSPCFs_gMO_ZloFK_Ods47Z08uMw6zELxkSw_aem_BhmrDvthdrUr_RrI6aDFBA" target="_blank"&gt;allergy-related tips on social media&lt;/a&gt;. Taking your shoes off and storing them in a closet or foyer is a good start, but there's more.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When you come home, "before you sit down on furniture or in your bed, you ideally should take off any clothes that would have been touching the outside world," Rubin says. Socks, pants, shirts all go directly in your laundry. Rubin also recommends taking a shower or a bath before bed to rinse pollen from your skin and hair.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When indoors, Rubin recommends keeping your windows and doors closed as much as possible. That may be a bummer if you love a spring breeze, but you're inviting pollen and mold into your house whenever you open the windows, says Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If you're allergic to pollen, the stuff is more likely to float through windows on a dry and windy day. Rubin says rainy days are good for flushing pollen out of the air. But if you're allergic to mold, it's better to keep windows shut on rainy days too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you've just got to open those windows, Rubin says an indoor air purifier can provide some relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Wipe down or bathe your pets&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have a dog, cat or any pet who spends time outside, wipe the animal off whenever they come inside, says Rubin. You can pick up allergy-friendly wipes at pet stores. It's also worth giving pets more frequent baths to remove pollen, says Dr. Neelima Tummala, an ENT physician and clinical assistant professor in otolaryngology at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep your nose clean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, look at when pollen counts are really high and try to avoid being outdoors during those times of day, advises Tummala. Right now we're in tree pollen season … and tree pollen tends to be highest in the mornings, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; Want to enjoy nature with fewer sneezes? It turns out the masks we got used to wearing to prevent COVID transmission "can be very helpful actually," says Rubin, when it comes to keeping out pollen and mold. He points to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7467086/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; where health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic reported reduced allergy symptoms when they were wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to rinse out your nose when you get home, says Rubin. You can do that with a neti pot or a saline spray. If you go the neti pot route, be sure to use distilled water, or tap water that's been boiled and cooled down, Rubin cautions. (Water straight from the tap comes with a small risk of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/03/1160980794/neti-pot-safety-brain-eating-amoeba" target="_blank"&gt;sending an amoeba to eat your brain&lt;/a&gt; – eek!)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Know your meds and when to use what&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Different allergy medications treat different symptoms. Here are a few common ones, and what to know about how to use them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral and nasal antihistamines&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're experiencing itchy eyes, a runny nose, or sneezing, an oral antihistamine like Zyrtec, Claritin, or Allegra should help, Rubin says. Astepro is a nasal spray with antihistamine, which Rubin usually recommends pairing with a steroid spray. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steroid nasal sprays. &lt;/strong&gt;If you've got congestion or postnasal drip, that's where nasal sprays come in. Examples of common steroid sprays are Flonase, Nasacort and Nasonex.  However, "We don't always tell people to take [steroid sprays] year-round," says Rubin. So check with your physician about how long you should be using it. Nasal steroid sprays take a few weeks to kick in, notes Tummala. With pollen season starting earlier, "you may need to start your intranasal steroid spray earlier than you used to," so they'll be optimally effective, she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nasal decongestants&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're really stuffed up and need instant relief,  you may want to try  a nasal decongestant spray like Afrin or Vicks Sinex, Rubin says.  These sprays shrink the blood vessels in your nasal passages. But Rubin cautions against using them for more than 3 to 5 days at a time, because after you stop, you can develop a rebound nasal congestion that gets progressively worse. "You almost become dependent upon it and it's hard to get rid of," he warns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Nasal spray the right way &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;You're probably doing it wrong. I know I was. "A lot of people just naturally go&lt;em&gt;, snort, spray, snort&lt;/em&gt;. What that does is it just shoots the medicine to the back of your throat where you taste it. And if you taste it, you waste it," Rubin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rubin_allergy/video/7219482513071148331" target="_blank"&gt;demonstrated how to use nasal spray properly&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok that went viral. Here's his secret to getting it right:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;I tell people 'nose to toes.' So you look down and then you place the nozzle up, but then you tilt it slightly towards the ear on the same side as your nostril. And after you spray on each side, you look forward and breathe through your mouth. Breathe normally, maybe a slight inhalation through your nose, but you never snort it," Rubin advises.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Why aim towards the ear? The ear is connected to the back of the throat and nasal cavity through the eustachian tube, so decreasing inflammation in that area will lower the risk of getting fluid behind your ear. Pointing the spray bottle towards the ear also targets openings between your nasal passages and your sinuses, lowering your risk of developing a sinus infection, says Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Be aware of factors that can worsen your allergic reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rubin uses a concept called &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHjNoY8RLE0/" target="_blank"&gt;the allergy symptom threshold&lt;/a&gt; to explain how exposure to multiple allergens, along with other factors, can trigger symptoms.  "You could be exposed to one pollen grain and not sneeze, but if you're exposed to a thousand, you're going to sneeze because there's enough there that will activate the immune system," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That goes for different kinds of allergens too. For instance, last week I was in Washington D.C., contending with pollen from the lovely cherry blossoms outside, and my sister's cat Felicia indoors. My sinuses were not pleased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's like you have a cup and you're filling it with different allergens and exposures, says Rubin." (He &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHjNoY8RLE0/" target="_blank"&gt;illustrates the concept&lt;/a&gt; in another video.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other factors can also increase your likelihood of having an allergic reaction. For some people Rubin says, drinking alcohol lowers the threshold, and some are more vulnerable when they exercise, particularly outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you happen to be sick, "your immune system is aggravated and hyperactive," Rubin says, and more likely to respond to allergens. (It can also work the other way around – if mucus builds up in your sinuses because of allergies and you're less able to fend off a respiratory infection that comes your way, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It goes back to reducing exposure, says Rubin: The more you can cut back your exposures to all kinds of allergens and irritants, the more successful you'll be at preventing an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR's Maria Godoy contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not uncommon for the person affected to accuse their mate of losing or misplacing items, making mistakes, causing confusion or forgetting things as a result of their disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y6ULFNSZXVHNRBV3UKEB5DBRC4"&gt; Dementia (there are several types), a host of other medical conditions or perhaps a combination of medications could be the culprit behind this sudden change in personality and behavior.

The spouse can schedule a private appointment with the doctor to give him a heads-up and see where it goes from there. A sudden and dramatic shift in personality or behavior, whether positive or negative, warrants a medical checkup (think brain tumors, too). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AGFCMQHC5RB6DASOAFGSUYTDE4"&gt; I’ve seen this happen with loved ones dealing with metastatic cancer, dementia and prescription medications that, though taken as prescribed, became toxic and overloaded the body, leading to these kinds of effects.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARATOGA SPRINGS — Intermountain Health on Friday broke ground on the site of its new multi-specialty clinic, which will include a dedicated cancer center, for residents of northern Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intermountain Saratoga Springs Multi-Specialty Clinic and Cancer Center plans to offer a wide range of specialized services, including OB/GYN care, gastroenterology care, audiology, urology, cardiology and pediatrics services, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer center within the clinic will provide comprehensive cancer care, such as chemotherapy treatments and support services. This will include survivorship services like oncology social work and &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/cancer-care/aya" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;oncology nurse navigators&lt;/a&gt;, who guide patients through the health care system and help manage expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new cancer center will join only two others in the county — located in American Fork and Provo — in hopes of easing the burden on patients who would otherwise need to regularly travel around 20 to 50 miles round trip to receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intermountain has a very strong belief that cancer care should be delivered close to home," said Desiree Dougherty, assistant regional service line director for Intermountain Health. "Carrying the burden of cancer ... is time consuming, creates stress, anxiety, time away from work, and they all have to spend hours in centers on days that they feel awful. The care is hard, and the treatments are difficult. So bringing cancer care close to home for these patients is incredibly important so they can have the care that they need with their families close to home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie and Scott Stone felt the full weight of this burden when Laurie was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2022. She went through extensive testing and was advised to have a hysterectomy. Following her procedure, doctors determined she would also need radiation therapy, which she received at the Intermountain cancer centers in American Fork and Provo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This required frequent 25- or 50-mile trips, typically during heavy morning traffic. Two years after Laurie Stone's diagnosis, Scott received abnormal blood test results at his yearly physical and was also diagnosed with cancer. Laurie Stone has now completed treatment and anxiously awaits the five-year mark, where she will be declared cancer free, and Scott Stone is still undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair were present at Friday's groundbreaking ceremony and expressed their deep gratitude and love for the medical staff in Intermountain's oncology network who have supported them over the years. While they will still need to travel for the remainder of Scott Stone's treatment, the couple is excited that these services will be available just 5 miles from their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm so grateful for this center being here closer to home and that our community can take advantage of (it). Thank you very much," said Scott Stone, addressing Intermountain staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary clinic aims to provide more services to northern Utah County because it is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51012325/these-were-utahs-fastest-growing-cities-in-2023--and-the-cities-that-lost-population" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;fastest-growing areas&lt;/a&gt; in the state. Saratoga Springs is home to over 59,000 residents as of 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.saratogasprings-ut.gov/DocumentCenter/View/14460/24-25-Citizens-Budget" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;almost doubling&lt;/a&gt; its population since 2018. Eagle Mountain has around 64,000 residents and &lt;a href="https://eaglemountain.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EagleMountainCityUT_Demos_2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;is projected to grow&lt;/a&gt; to nearly 80,000 by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our vision for this clinic is simple, which is that we want to bring the full strength of Intermountain cancer services into a space that feels local, personal and healing," said Brandon Barney, medical director of radiation oncology services. "Patients here will have access to the same cutting edge technology that they would get in Salt Lake or at Utah Valley Hospital. That includes treatments with radiotherapy, with chemotherapy ... in-office procedures, radiation treatment planning. There's not really going to be a disease site or a type of cancer that we won't be able to treat here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic will be located at 392 W. Medical Drive in Saratoga Springs, between Intermountain Saratoga Springs Emergency Department and Surgery Center buildings and plans to open in fall 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rarely think about food in relation to our mental health. We worry about it leading to health issues, such as &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-heart-health_l_63e51cdfe4b0255caae9f325" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-digestion-health_l_6411d77ce4b0a3902d2e1014" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681"&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; problems, but did you know that different foods and beverages can exacerbate anxiety spikes and even bouts of depression? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are foods and drinks that therapists and psychiatrists, who have spent their careers advising people on mental wellness, typically avoid ― or consume in moderation ― for the sake of their mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take this knowledge with a grain of salt. These foods and drinks can be consumed once in a while and not be correlated with negative mental health consequences. Just remember that, as with everything, moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Cups Of Coffee Or Espresso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, too much caffeine can have a negative impact on anxiety. “If a person is prone to feeling anxious or has multiple stressors, know that over-caffeination causes an increased cortisol response and can lead to adrenal fatigue, a recipe for persistent stress and burnout, not to mention sleep issues,” said licensed clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=64667c76e4b035573934d585&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdrbrittneyjones%2F" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Brittney Jones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668773/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that consuming more than 250 milligrams of caffeine per day (that’s roughly 2 1/2 cups) could have a negative impact on anxiety, so Jones does her best to keep her coffee consumption under that amount. And for people who get jitters or anxiety spikes from coffee, consuming caffeine in the form of matcha can be a great alternative since it gives many people a feeling of calm alertness &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056735/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;thanks to a compound called L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet Soda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking out for your mental health this summer, you might want to keep your diet soda consumption to a minimum. “Everyone loves a cold diet soda on a warm summer day, but the health concerns outweigh the benefits,” said &lt;a href="https://www.sohomd.com/psychiatrist-dr-jospitre" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Jacques Jospitre, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified psychiatrist and co-founder of SohoMD. “While we know high-sugar sodas aren’t great for our health, diet sodas might actually be even worse. Many of these contain phenylalanine, which is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28198207/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;an added chemical well-known to mess up brain neurochemistry&lt;/a&gt; by stopping the proper production of serotonin and dopamine, two molecules we need for good mood.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these drinks have artificial sweeteners like aspartame, “which is a known neurotoxin and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1028415X.2017.1288340#:~:text=Aspartame%20acts%20as%20a%20chemical,adverse%20effects%20on%20neurobehavioral%20health." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;may raise stress hormones like cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as increase the amount of free radicals in the brain,” Jospitre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a drink or two once in a while isn’t the worst thing, &lt;a href="https://www.livebettertherapysolutions.com/about" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Danielle Tucci&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed professional counselor and the founder of Live Better Therapy Solutions, said she does her best to avoid alcohol when considering her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

Around 90% of unvaccinated close contacts contract the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montana health officials told Cowboy State Daily on Friday that all the people infected live in Gallatin County and are currently isolated at home. The five people are unvaccinated, or their vaccine status is unknown. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how these infections came to light. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“On April 11, we received an initial notification regarding individuals who had been potentially exposed to measles, and then following the development of symptoms in those individuals testing was conducted at the Montana Public Health Laboratory and then those cases were officially confirmed yesterday on April 17,” said Gallatin City-County Health Officer Lori Christenson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Christenson detailed how five people, children and adults from two households in Gallatin County, recently attended the same event out of state. Christenson said she could not identify the type of event or its exact location, but these five people were there together. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then around April 11, the five people were alerted by others who attended the event that they may have been exposed to measles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They did a great thing,” said Dr. Peter Bulger, infectious disease medical director at Bozeman Health and Gallatin City-County Health Department. They reported it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, the five infected people were seen by physicians via a telehealth visit to prevent further infections. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, in a scene reminiscent of the COVID-19 pandemic, they drove to Bozeman Health Deaconess Regional Medical Center, where medical professionals in protective gear took samples from them while they remained in their vehicle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think flashback to the pandemic is like the phrase of the day today,” said Bulger. “I think everybody's feeling a little sort of some PTSD about this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles Hot Zones? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the public health team in Gallatin County traced the movements of the five infected people, they pinpointed two businesses on U.S. Highway 191: North Coast Electric in Four Corners and Interwest Tire in Belgrade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, tire stores across Gallatin County are full of customers coming in to switch out their studded snow tires for summer tires. Anyone present at Interwest Tire between noon-4 p.m. on April 14 could have been exposed, according to public health officials. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three days earlier on April 11, between 7:30-10:30 a.m. at North Coast Electric, exposures to the measles virus were possible.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone concerned about their proximity to these locations during these times should contact the Gallatin County Health Department if they experience a cough, runny nose, fevers, red watery eyes, and then the appearance of little white spots in their mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A rash often develops, sometimes starting on the forehead and then spreading down the rest of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Friday, public health officials said no new suspected infections had been reported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have no evidence whatsoever that there is a connection to any other community in Montana outside of Gallatin County or to Wyoming at this time,” said Bulger. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poster In The Hall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Family nurse practitioner Liesel Pessl worked at Community Health Partners, a federally funded health center in Gallatin County, for 24 years. In that time, she never treated a patient suspected of a measles infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We had a poster in our hallway showing common or what historically have been common infections that had rashes that we might have to identify at some point,” Pessl said. “But over the course of my time there, I never once saw a measles rash. It has a pretty definitive rash inside the mouth that is unique.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pessl did encounter parents who were hesitant to vaccinate their children with the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, also known as the MMR. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When you talk to patients about vaccines and they are hesitant, what I would always try to do is help understand what their concerns were,” said Pessl. “If it were an autism concern, we could try to have that discussion about how, yes there was a study, but it was retracted and found to not be accurate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medical staff contacted by Cowboy State Daily also warned about misinformation about vitamin A. It apparently helps reduce symptoms in children, but must be administered in precise doses because too much can cause an overdose and result in liver damage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As of April 17, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were being monitored in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And now Montana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Madison can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:david@cowboystatedaily.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;david@cowboystatedaily.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPdGpiQzdURXVFZlMzeUxleGt3Y3U1NldHNW81bVJKdUswU3Z4WFFYR0lGRU5yTmVuSWJVeWNjelcxc05hZkRuajQyd1ZpSnpLaG1VLVBqQ0NoU0lYMTNta1p3NkJDTTRQRlAyTjVNbTB6UUpDU1NqdUhqYjFrcTdHaHl3R3MtY2pJeWpJWG1ZXy0wRmpkd1BySU5Pa2l0THg5NnRWUWRqUlpza0NVWWxnSzhSMA</guid></item><item><title>俄勒冈州罕见的疯牛病导致2人死亡- SFGATE | Rare mad cow-like brain disease kills 2 in Oregon - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNelJHVE5ScXQxQk52RUEtUzExZnc5NVk1cmg0U3EtazB4Qnd6ZFRabUZORWl3a0h6ODFxZkR6cDJtOUQ5eFVnNEMwZmJKcDZlcXhSSDBFZVhNRHd4X1BxUnQxWjRZcHVsWng3NHVIaEhYZ1loRkdreEZUME52cXhYeEdpeHU3NzlHM1JGdnNiR2FqQVZ4SFBj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three cases of a rare and fatal brain disorder have been identified in Hood River County, Oregon, local health officials have confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an April 14 &lt;a href="https://www.hoodrivercounty.gov/index.asp?SEC=AF40862A-8B0E-4107-B2B4-956029C71941&amp;amp;DE=11E4744C-DDC6-4DBD-8F95-B86EFBB310E6" data-link="native" class=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the Hood River County Health Department confirmed one case and identified two probable cases of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&lt;/a&gt;, or CJD — a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative condition &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;with a 100% fatality rate&lt;/a&gt;.

Most people die within a year once symptoms occur, according to the CDC. One of the CJD cases was confirmed through an autopsy, while the other two are considered presumptive diagnoses, &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/04/2-in-oregon-die-of-rare-brain-disease.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the Oregonian &lt;/a&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trish Elliott, the director of the Hood River County Health Department, told the outlet that presumptive cases can only be confirmed after death through the testing of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid.

            Colombia’s health ministry declared a nationwide health emergency on Thursday due to the “active circulation” of yellow fever.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0002356qhkd5ab7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since September 2024, there have been 75 recorded cases of yellow fever and 34 deaths from the illness, according to the Colombian Health Ministry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0003356q2z69kpqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nine of the country’s 32 departments have reported at least one case of yellow fever. Most were detected in rural areas of the Tolima and Meta departments, the Amazon basin, and the Magdalena River region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0004356qiu9ijh46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases have also been reported in areas where the virus has not been historically located, such as the coffee-growing Caldas region, according to the president’s office.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0005356q3p3onppr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some regions were already under alert before it was extended nationwide due to the expected surge in travel during Easter weekend. Travel to some zones with a critical virus presence will also be restricted under the health emergency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nawztv0000356q5dho4m10@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yellow fever is a disease that is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nb6q6i000r356qr55jrhbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people do not experience symptoms from the disease, while others experience fever, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever" target="_blank"&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the WHO. In most cases, symptoms disappear after three to four days.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nb6q6i000s356qumns0bf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, some patients enter a second phase of illness in which they develop jaundice and abdominal pain, among other symptoms. Half the patients who enter this phase die within seven to 10 days, according to the WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nb6q6i000t356qijatq75b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific anti-viral drug treatment for yellow fever; the WHO advises that patients rest, stay hydrated, and seek medical attention as needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0006356q608zid5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The office of President Gustavo Petro urged Colombians to receive the single-dose vaccine, which is free and can be administered to anyone older than nine months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0007356q8njbgg9f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical teams would be deployed to administer vaccines in the affected areas, the office announced.

            “In two months, the entire Colombian population must be vaccinated against yellow fever,” Petro said on X. “We must do this, and our health system must guarantee it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Petro added that he would declare an economic emergency due to the situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Petro’s office said that the Ministry of Health and the National Health Institute have deployed more than 20 immediate response teams to investigate the spread of the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000b356q9kx40fwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have already asked each territorial entity to have a hospital to which people suffering from the disease can go, so that we can exercise clear and definitive control over them from there,” Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo stated to local media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000c356qt22snnp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some opposing political figures argued that the government’s response to the disease comes too late.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It is unacceptable for the government to declare a health and economic emergency for yellow fever when the crisis started six months ago,” said Senator Paloma Valencia from the Democratic Center party. “Decisions should have been made a long time ago to prevent deaths.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000e356qqkn0uyu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Petro will hold a broadcast cabinet meeting on emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus and release a new report on the progress of the disease on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rates of obesity are rising, and it seems like more people are trying specialized diets, particularly those that cut back on carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Currently, more than 40% of adults in the United States experience obesity, and while &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-for-dinner-for-weight-loss-11696366" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;many aim to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;, keeping that weight off remains a significant challenge as obesity rates continue to grow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the International Food Information Council, 43% of people believe carbohydrates or sugars are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024124/best-carb-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the main cause of weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. But only 25% of folks see calories from all sources as contributing to weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, scientific studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291554/30-day-low-carb-meal-plan-1200-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cutting carbs&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t offer significant weight loss benefits when the total number of calories consumed is the same.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And there are downsides to a low-carb diet, too—some research suggests that cutting back on carbohydrates can lead to inadequacies in key vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To shed more light on those concerns, a group of researchers analyzed data to help figure out if adults on low-carb diets are missing out on some macronutrients and, if so, which ones. They published their work, which also includes insights about how fat may affect macronutrient intake, in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study relies on data collected as part of a large, ongoing health study called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. These researchers focused on data from adults aged 20 years or older that was collected from 2007 to 2018, which resulted in just over 15,000 participants for the study. On average, the participants were 48 years old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants in the study were divided into two main groups based on the percentage of calories they consumed from carbohydrates, which was determined based on food surveys that participants took. The first group included those with a carbohydrate intake of less than 45% of their total energy, referred to as the "restricted carbohydrate" group. The second group included those whose diets met established guidelines for carbohydrates (45% to 65% of energy), as well as for other nutrients like fats, protein and specific fatty acids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Intake of certain nutrients, like vitamins A, B12, C, D and E, as well as folate, iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc, were assessed to see how many people might not be getting enough when following the lower carb dietary pattern. They also checked how many people consume too much sodium. The research analyzed what people get from food alone and, for most nutrients, also included supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To further understand the role of fats, the restricted carbohydrate group was split into smaller subgroups based on how much fat they consumed. These subgroups looked at total fat and the types of fat, such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fats to analyze intakes of certain nutrients. By analyzing these patterns, researchers aimed to identify connections between dietary intake and nutrient deficiencies across the population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Compared to the group that followed the recommended dietary ranges, those in the low-carb group were slightly less likely to be women, more likely to have finished college, and had a higher income compared to their household needs. The low-carb group consumed fewer carbohydrates but more protein, more fat and more alcohol compared to the recommended group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People following a diet low in carbohydrates were more likely to have too little of certain minerals and vitamins compared to those who followed a balanced diet that met all recommended intake ranges. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, the low-carb group was more likely to be deficient in:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Iron &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Folate &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the brighter side, the low-carb group was less likely to be deficient in zinc and vitamin B12. Those on a lower carb diet were likely to consume more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/choline-dementia-study-8779484" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt; than recommended, but they also ate more sodium than recommended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When people following a low-carb diet were grouped by how much total fat they ate, further patterns emerged regarding their nutrient levels. For instance, those on a low-carb, low-fat diet were more likely to consume less calcium and vitamin E than recommended. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And different types of fat were linked to different intakes of certain nutrients as well. For example, the research team investigated how monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake affected nutrient levels in people on low-carb diets. They found that a low-carb, low-MUFA diet often led to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of vitamin E, while a high-MUFA diet supported healthy potassium intake. MUFAs are found in foods &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;like olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and avocado. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also looked into similar relationships between some micronutrients and polyunsaturated fats and saturated fat, finding, for example, that a diet lower in saturated fat was more likely to support healthy calcium intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings suggest that the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and micronutrient inadequacy is dependent on the amount and type of fat intake, which has implications for clinical practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note a few limitations when considering this data. The information about food intake came from self-reports, which can sometimes be inaccurate due to personal bias or errors in recall. Additionally, participants were grouped into the carb-restricted category regardless of whether they were intentionally following this type of diet or not. Lastly, everyone with a carbohydrate intake below 45% of their total energy was grouped together, but it’s possible that varying levels of carbohydrate restriction could lead to different outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those considering a low-carbohydrate diet, these findings highlight some practical takeaways that can guide healthier choices. While reducing carbohydrates might seem like a straightforward way to manage weight, it’s essential to understand the potential trade-offs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on carbs without carefully planning your diet can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals like magnesium, vitamin C and folate. These nutrients play vital roles in energy production, immune function and overall health, so it’s crucial to make adjustments to ensure you’re not missing out on them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplementation can be a useful strategy to address nutrient gaps, especially for individuals following more restrictive diet plans. But it’s important to remember that supplementation isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Consulting with a healthcare provider or a dietitian ensures personalized advice tailored to your specific diet, lifestyle and health needs. They can help assess whether supplements are necessary and recommend the right dosage to complement your diet safely and effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A balanced approach to low-carb eating can make all the difference. Incorporating diverse food groups, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and lean proteins, can help mitigate the risk of nutrient deficiencies while still reaping the benefits of carbohydrate reduction. By paying attention to dietary quality and seeking professional input when needed, you can pursue your health goals while maintaining optimal nutrition and well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/em&gt; highlights potential nutritional gaps among people who follow a low-carbohydrate diet. While many people turn to these diets to shed excess weight, it comes with potential downsides, including deficiencies in some vitamins, iron, magnesium and folate. Micronutrient deficiencies can compromise energy levels, immune support and long-term health outcomes. These risks emphasize the necessity of a well-structured diet (or even strategic supplementation) to avoid any nutritional gaps while following a low-carb lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the takeaway is clear—diet quality matters just as much as diet quantity. For those choosing a low-carb approach, prioritizing nutrient-dense foods is essential to ensure proper health and functionality. This might mean incorporating foods like spinach, avocados, nuts, and berries, which can supply vital vitamins and minerals typically missing from low-carb meal plans. By making informed adjustments, consulting with health professionals and tailoring dietary choices to individual needs, those pursuing low-carb diets can achieve more sustainable and healthful outcomes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It helps you understand how and where disease is spreading, how the virus is evolving,” Feinberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RHCACSJPNBA3DASCLBM6WFVQ4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Though hepatitis can be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/abc/index.htm"&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by heavy alcohol use and some medications, it can also be sparked by a virus that causes liver inflammation, jaundice, fever and other symptoms. Tens of thousands of new cases of viral hepatitis occur every year in the U.S., according to the CDC. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;Viral hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; kills thousands of Americans every year and is a leading cause of liver cancer. The three most common viruses that cause hepatitis are hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and depending on the type can be spread through close contact, consuming contaminated food, sharing needles or contact with infected blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IXHNKF7QTVA53F7H562FUTFK7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In recent years, hepatitis C outbreaks have been linked to pain clinics, dialysis facilities, outpatient surgery clinics and prisons, according to CDC data. Other labs can provide testing to confirm whether someone has hepatitis, but they cannot perform the genetic testing to identify whether someone’s infection is part of a transmission cluster, lab experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4KCD5AXOVZATFPON4NHVE4VLCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The CDC’s viral hepatitis lab had already identified nine infected patients in a Florida outbreak and had begun receiving blood samples from additional patients to piece together how the outbreak spread when scientists were fired, according to internal CDC documents and two lab scientists who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The lab would have used its advanced technology to identify whether additional patients carried the same strain of the virus, which would mean they were part of the same transmission cluster, the employee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DBQ4F6X45RCF5F6CSQUFWVNTVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last week, the CDC sent an email to state and local health departments and other partners saying it was no longer providing viral-hepatitis-related laboratory services, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. “Specimen submissions will no longer be accepted,” the email said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MUBMKL6B35CETM2CCAIXSDMY4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unclear how states will handle future cases.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n89vu6002i3575frujrgl5@published"&gt;I divorced my children’s dad for a “bad” reason in their minds, and they are so angry, and I’m not sure how to work through it with them. My kids are 18 and 20, and in college. In their narrative (and their dad’s), I filed for divorce the instant the youngest went to college because I hated their grandma and wanted her to die alone. To me, it’s more complicated. In 2023, my MIL moved in with us for emergency caregiving for Alzheimer’s. She and my husband weren’t close. He was a surprise youngest kid and she openly resented him for it in childhood, although she apologized a few years ago. It seemed like he was trying to make it up to her by taking her in. His older siblings suggested a nursing home, and offered to help arrange it. She could afford it, even. Instead, he moved her in without consulting me, and she needed a lot of help. She could be pretty mean even before the dementia removed her filter, so once that happened, things really deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n81g1f00132xksu3l3rbuc@published"&gt;After two years of burnout, anger, and exhaustion, I fell out of love. We had multiple conversations and even marriage counseling about the ways his unilateral decisions were hurting our marriage. The last straw was his refusal to the idea of a home health aide after she accidentally set a small fire and needed daytime supervision. Instead, he suggested I take FMLA (he’s already used his) or go part-time to stay home with her. I realized he wasn’t even trying to look out for his mom’s best interests, or mine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n8a3xe002n3575yk95hb1w@published"&gt;I filed for divorce, and he immediately told our kids that it was because I hated Grandma and didn’t want to care for others. It hit on a painful point for me and the kids; I was the primary earner with long hours for all of their middle school years because their dad was unemployed. I never got to spend as much time with them as I wanted, and I know they resent that. So to them, it feels like more of the same. What can I do to make room for their pain but not get excommunicated?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, that doesn’t stop your kids from being hurt over the divorce, but you aren’t responsible for their pain. Your children are young adults; they’re old enough to handle the truth about why you split from their father. Be honest with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n8a6gp002u3575dpb5mypl@published"&gt;Talk to them about what life was like with your MIL and their father’s refusal to get her the sort of help she needs. Acknowledge that the idea of you “refusing” to be around may be triggering because of their childhood experiences, but let them know you did everything within reason to make things work, until you simply couldn’t anymore. Be empathetic and let them know that you know the divorce hurts them; give them the space to express their grief while still standing up for yourself. It may take them some time to understand, but hopefully, they’ll come to respect the way you advocated for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

						Health and workplace safety officials inspected a Massachusetts hospital this week after at least six staff members developed benign brain tumors over several years. Their visits are the latest in a series of investigations seeking answers about the mysterious cases. Affected staff members worked on the fifth floor of Newton-Wellesley Hospital, in the post-partum and labor and delivery units, over many years. Representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Massachusetts Department of Health conducted their inspection of the labor and delivery unit on Wednesday, DPH confirmed. Additionally, DPH's Division of Radiation Control Program was scheduled to visit the hospital on Friday to review information provided by the hospital's radiation safety officer and perform measurements of their own.DPH confirmed their work with OSHA, but the federal agency has not yet responded to a request for a statement. Hospital officials said they conducted their own investigation of the facility and found no evidence that the tumors were caused by the work environment. "Based on these findings, we are confident that no environmental risks are linked to these cases," Mass General Brigham officials said in a statement. Newton-Wellesley Hospital is a part of the Mass General Brigham hospital group. The Massachusetts Nurses Association declined to provide a statement, citing their own ongoing investigation of the situation. Mass General Brigham statement:“The health and wellbeing of our staff, clinicians, and patients is our top priority and we have conducted a thorough investigation into our environment after reports of brain tumors in individuals who have worked in our labor and delivery and post-partum care units at some point over the past 23 years. Based on these findings, we are confident that no environmental risks are linked to these cases. We continue to support our colleagues.This scientific investigation was conducted by external environmental consultants in collaboration with our Department of Occupational Health and Safety, Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices. Alongside evaluating potential environmental exposures, individuals with concerns were given the opportunity to be interviewed by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors.We continue to collaborate with state and federal regulatory agencies and provide the results of our investigation to the relevant stakeholder groups, including staff and the Massachusetts Nurses Association, and have held multiple forums to meet with clinical and Occupational Health leaders to answer their questions. To be clear, our rigorous investigation has not identified any environmental trigger at Newton-Wellesley Hospital that causes brain tumors. We remain confident that our environment is safe for staff, clinicians, and patients.”-Jonathan Sonis, MD, MHCM, Associate Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs-Sandy Muse, DNP, FNP-BC, NEA-BC, Chief Nursing Officer and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services

						&lt;strong class="dateline"&gt;NEWTON, Mass. —&lt;/strong&gt; 													&lt;p&gt;Health and workplace safety officials inspected a Massachusetts hospital this week after at least six staff members developed benign brain tumors over several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their visits are the latest in a series of investigations seeking answers about the mysterious cases. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Affected staff members worked on the fifth floor of Newton-Wellesley Hospital, in the post-partum and labor and delivery units, over many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Massachusetts Department of Health conducted their inspection of the labor and delivery unit on Wednesday, DPH confirmed. Additionally, DPH's Division of Radiation Control Program was scheduled to visit the hospital on Friday to review information provided by the hospital's radiation safety officer and perform measurements of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DPH confirmed their work with OSHA, but the federal agency has not yet responded to a request for a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospital officials said they conducted their own investigation of the facility and found no evidence that the tumors were caused by the work environment. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Based on these findings, we are confident that no environmental risks are linked to these cases," Mass General Brigham officials said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cream-inline-rec" class="cream-inline hidden"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton-Wellesley Hospital is a part of the Mass General Brigham hospital group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Nurses Association declined to provide a statement, citing their own ongoing investigation of the situation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-h2" id="mass-general-brigham-statement"&gt;Mass General Brigham statement:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health and wellbeing of our staff, clinicians, and patients is our top priority and we have conducted a thorough investigation into our environment after reports of brain tumors in individuals who have worked in our labor and delivery and post-partum care units at some point over the past 23 years. Based on these findings, we are confident that no environmental risks are linked to these cases. We continue to support our colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scientific investigation was conducted by external environmental consultants in collaboration with our Department of Occupational Health and Safety, Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices. Alongside evaluating potential environmental exposures, individuals with concerns were given the opportunity to be interviewed by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to collaborate with state and federal regulatory agencies and provide the results of our investigation to the relevant stakeholder groups, including staff and the Massachusetts Nurses Association, and have held multiple forums to meet with clinical and Occupational Health leaders to answer their questions. To be clear, our rigorous investigation has not identified any environmental trigger at Newton-Wellesley Hospital that causes brain tumors. We remain confident that our environment is safe for staff, clinicians, and patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Jonathan Sonis, MD, MHCM, Associate Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Sandy Muse, DNP, FNP-BC, NEA-BC, Chief Nursing Officer and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TANEY COUNTY, Mo. — A child in Taney County, Missouri, tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/measles-outbreak-second-child-death-west-texas/507-04b98dea-051c-4874-ae73-1667b546f8ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles &lt;/a&gt;this week, the first case of the illness in the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a news release from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, there is no indication of widespread exposure, and known contacts have been contacted. The department has not yet verified the vaccination status of the child, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral illness. The symptoms are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever, cough, runny nose and red and watery eyes, and can emerge seven-to-14 days after contact with the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measles rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms. It usually begins as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/photos.html" id="isPasted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;flat red spots&lt;/a&gt; that appear on the face at the hairline. They then spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said measles can cause severe medical complications, including pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus can remain infectious in the air and on surfaces for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area. People who are infected will begin to have symptoms on average one to two weeks after being exposed to a person with measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said the best way to avoid getting sick is to get the two-dose vaccination, which it says prevents more than 97% of cases. The CDC and the Missouri DHSS recommend children receive one dose of MMR at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. Unvaccinated adults can also receive “catch-up” MMR vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For those unvaccinated or those unsure of their vaccination status, now is the time to review records and get caught up if needed,” said Dr. George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist with DHSS.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than 60 years of genetic guessing, scientists have finally cracked the code behind what makes orange cats so… orange. In &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.19.624036v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two separate studies&lt;/a&gt; published on&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have identified a specific &lt;strong&gt;DNA deletion&lt;/strong&gt; on the X chromosome that turns a regular cat into a fiery feline. The discovery sheds new light on how genetics drive fur color—and why orange cats are almost always male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Secret Sits In Silent DNA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit isn’t a mutation in a typical gene that codes for pigment. Instead, the answer lies in a &lt;strong&gt;non-coding region&lt;/strong&gt;—a stretch of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/new-dna-study-reveals-neanderthals-survived-interbred-modern-humans/" data-type="post" data-id="73229"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t build proteins but controls how genes behave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that orange cats have a &lt;strong&gt;5,000-base-pair deletion&lt;/strong&gt; just before a gene called &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;. This deletion causes the gene to become overactive, especially in &lt;strong&gt;melanocytes&lt;/strong&gt;, the pigment-producing &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/after-death-a-new-life-takes-shape-scientists-astonishing-discovery-about-our-cells/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/how-do-cats-actually-sleep/" data-type="post" data-id="72001"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt; with this deletion produce more &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; RNA—up to &lt;strong&gt;13 times more&lt;/strong&gt; than cats without it. That overactivity shifts their fur color from dark black-brown to the reddish-gold we associate with marmalade cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How The X Chromosome Shapes A Cat’s Coat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The orange gene sits on the &lt;strong&gt;X chromosome&lt;/strong&gt;, which helps explain one of the biggest quirks of orange cats: why most of them are male.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Male cats only have one X chromosome. If they inherit the version with the orange gene, they become fully orange. Female cats, on the other hand, have &lt;strong&gt;two X chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;—one from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In female cats, one X chromosome randomly turns off in each cell. That leads to a &lt;strong&gt;patchwork of fur colors&lt;/strong&gt;, often creating tortoiseshell or calico coats. Only if a female inherits two copies of the orange gene will she&lt;strong&gt; turn out completely orange&lt;/strong&gt;—a rare event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s Really Behind Calicos And Tortoiseshells?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calicos&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tortoiseshell cats&lt;/strong&gt; are genetic mosaics, and the orange gene plays a major role in that. But there’s another twist: a &lt;strong&gt;white-spotting gene&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tortoiseshell cats have intermingled patches of black and orange. Calicos have larger color blocks separated by white fur. That white comes from a gene that affects how pigment cells &lt;strong&gt;migrate and survive&lt;/strong&gt; as the kitten develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So even when the orange gene is present, its visual effect depends on how these other pigment genes behave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are Orange Cats Really “Goofy”?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The internet loves to joke that orange cats are lovable but a little less sharp. And while orange tabbies have a reputation for being clingy, chaotic, or not-so-bright, there’s &lt;strong&gt;no science&lt;/strong&gt; to back that up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ARHGAP36" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; gene&lt;/a&gt; has known roles in development, but in cats, it seems to only activate in skin pigment cells—not the brain. That means orange fur isn’t linked to intelligence or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, human perception plays a big role. Because orange cats are so visually distinct, we might be more likely to &lt;strong&gt;assign personalities&lt;/strong&gt; to them—whether or not those traits are real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Chapter In Feline Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new studies don’t just solve a long-standing mystery—they mark a &lt;strong&gt;turning point&lt;/strong&gt; in how scientists understand non-coding DNA. For decades, researchers focused mostly on protein-coding genes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, this discovery shows how even the &lt;strong&gt;“quiet” parts of the genome &lt;/strong&gt;can have big effects. And there may be more to uncover. Orange fur was just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

In its update, the CDC said 94% of cases this year are part outbreaks, which have reached 10 now—3 more than the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of all US states have reported cases, some of which are linked to international travel. Among illnesses reported so far, 96% of patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. So far, 85 patients (11%) were hospitalized, with the number of deaths remaining at 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Texas nears 600 infections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the main outbreak hot spot, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 36 more cases since April 15, boosting the state's total to 597, of which 371 are from Gaines County, though 24 other counties have also reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its list of other measles cases, the TDSHS reported 15 case-patients from Upshur County in the eastern part of the state, 2 of whom are Upshur County residents. Officials are examining the residency status of the other patients to determine if the cases are linked to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks in New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak. The &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data"&gt;Kansas Department of Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt; this week reported 5 more cases, bringing its total to 37 infections in eight counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Michigan reports outbreak, Montana reports cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/inside-mdhhs/newsroom/2025/04/17/measles-outbreak"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the state's first measles outbreak since 2019, which involves three cases from Montcalm County in the western part of the state. Official added that the outbreak was initially linked to a large ongoing outbreak in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other outbreak developments, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.healthygallatin.org/community-health/communicable-diseases/measles/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the state's first measles cases since 1990. Officials said they are investigating five cases, which include children and adults living in Gallatin County who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Officials said the patients are isolating at home and that so far two potential public exposure sites in Belgrade and Bozeman have been identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their study, Gaby et al. organized an on-campus "Speed-Friending" event for 40 female volunteers, consisting of four distinct phases. First, participants had their headshots taken. Next, they looked at pictures of all the other women participating and rated friendship potential based solely on visual cues. Then the women wore a T-shirt for 12 hours as they went about their daily activities, which were then collected and placed in plastic bags. Finally, participants rated the friendship potential of anonymized participants based solely on smelling each T-shirt, followed by a live session during which they interacted with each woman for four minutes and rated their friendship potential. This was followed by a second round of smelling the T-shirts and once again rating friendship potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results: There was a strong correlation between the in-person evaluations of friendship potential and those based solely on smelling the T-shirts, with remarkable consistency. And the ratings made after live interactions accurately predicted changes in the assessments made in the final round of odor-based testing, suggesting a learned response element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everybody showed they had a consistent signature of what they liked,” &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/04/finding-friendship-first-whiff"&gt;said co-author Vivian Zayas&lt;/a&gt; of Cornell University. “And the consistency was not that, in the group, one person smelled really bad and one person smelled really good. No, it was idiosyncratic. I might like person A over B over C based on scent, and this pattern predicts who I end up liking in the chat. People take a lot in when they’re meeting face to face. But scent—which people are registering at some level, though probably not consciously—forecasts whether you end up liking this person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledged that their study was limited to college-aged heterosexual women and that there could be differences in how olfactory and other cues function in other groups: older or younger women, non-American women, men, and so forth. "Future studies might consider a wider age range, investigate individuals at different stages of development, focus on how these cues function in male-male platonic interactions, or examine how scent in daily interactions shapes friendship judgments in other cultures," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

				Rice, the world's most consumed grain, will &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/climate-change-will-make-rice-toxic-say-researchers/"&gt;become increasingly toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; as the atmosphere heats and as carbon dioxide emissions rise, potentially putting billions of people at risk of cancers and other diseases, according to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published this week in The Lancet. From a report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Eaten every day by billions of people and grown across the globe, rice is arguably the planet's most important staple crop, with half the world's population relying on it for the majority of its food needs, especially in developing countries.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

But the way rice is grown -- mostly submerged in paddies -- and its highly porous texture mean it can absorb unusually high levels of arsenic, a potent carcinogenic toxin that is especially dangerous for babies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt; After growing rice in controlled fields for six years, researchers from Columbia University and international partners found that when both temperature and CO2 increased in line with climate projections, arsenic levels in rice grains rose significantly. "When we put both of them together, then wow, that was really something we were not expecting," said Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist at Columbia University who led the study. "You're looking at a crop staple that's consumed by a billion people every day, and any effect on toxicity is going to have a pretty damn large effect." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Inorganic arsenic exposure has been linked to cancers, heart disease, and neurological problems in infants. Disease risk rose across all seven top rice-consuming Asian countries analyzed. "This is one more reason to intervene -- to control people's exposure," said co-author Keeve Nachman of Johns Hopkins University. "The No. 1 thing we can do is everything in our power to slow climate change."
