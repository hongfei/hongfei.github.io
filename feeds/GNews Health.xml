                &lt;p&gt;The International Space Station (ISS) is one of the most unique environments where life has ever existed, out in the low orbit of Earth. And research out today finds that bacteriophages—the viruses that prey on bacteria—can behave quite peculiarly in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists studied how phages interacted with &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria aboard the ISS and compared them to pairs grown on Earth. The space-dwelling phages took longer to infect their hosts, while both the bacteria and viruses developed unusual mutations in response to each other and the microgravity conditions of the ISS, they found. The findings also suggest that phages in space could develop mutations useful to humans back home.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Microbes continue to evolve under microgravity, and they do so in ways that are not always predictable from Earth-based experiments,” senior study author Vatsan Raman, a biomolecular and cellular engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Phages in space&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have documented that many microbes and other tiny living things can thrive aboard the ISS, including the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-international-space-station-is-a-cesspool-of-bacter-1833885488"&gt;microorganisms&lt;/a&gt; left behind by touring astronauts. But according to Raman, there’s been relatively little research examining how these space microbes interact with each other, especially phages and the bacteria they infect to make more of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most microbial evolution experiments implicitly assume Earth-like physical conditions, but spaceflight changes fundamental aspects of the environment—how fluids mix, how cells encounter one another, and how physical forces shape cellular physiology,” he explained. “Phage infection depends critically on transport, encounter rates, and host physiology, all of which could plausibly change in space. We wanted to test whether microgravity simply slows these processes down, or whether it pushes phages and bacteria along different evolutionary paths altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They focused on a particular kind of phage that loves to munch on &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, known as T7.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ISS phages were slower to infect their prey at first, likely because fluids don’t mix the same way under microgravity conditions, according to Raman. But once infection occurred, both the phages and bacteria rapidly adapted and often very differently from their Earth counterparts. The bacteria evolved in ways that seemed to boost their defenses against phage infection and enhance their survivability in space, while the phages evolved to more easily infect &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. What’s more, some of the genetic changes seen in the space phages were unlike anything seen on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that microgravity doesn’t just delay phage infection—it reshapes how phages and bacteria evolve together,” Raman said. “We observed mutations appearing in unexpected genes, including ones that are poorly characterized in standard laboratory settings.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://plos.io/4q4S9AO"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in PLOS Biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What this means&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings obviously have implications for space travel, especially longer-duration missions. The microbes living aboard the ISS and other space stations in the future aren’t just static tourists, and it’s certainly possible they could evolve in ways that have a real impact on the health of astronauts and the environment in general, Raman says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That scary possibility aside, space phages could also help humanity. The team’s experiments on Earth found that several of the changes seen aboard the ISS made the phages better at attacking T7-resistant strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that cause urinary tract infections in people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phages are already being developed as an alternative treatment for drug-resistant infections. And while it would be impractical to routinely run these sorts of experiments on the ISS, learning exactly how microgravity can shape the evolution of these microbes could allow scientists like Raman to apply those lessons to studies conducted on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I hope this work encourages researchers to think of space not just as a place to reproduce Earth experiments, but as a fundamentally different physical environment that can uncover new biology—insights that ultimately circle back to improve research and applications here on Earth,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers now hope to better understand the specific genes and mutations in T7 phages that emerged under microgravity, particularly the ones not easily created in a standard lab. They also hope that similar studies in the future will reveal how space can change the biology of more complex microbial communities or medically relevant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BERLIN — Decongestant nasal sprays can save you from a restless night when a cold clogs up your nose, but pharmacists warn this aid can be a slippery slope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaflet that comes with it will – if you read it – tell you that a decongestant spray should not be used for longer than seven days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacist Alexander Schmitz advises even more caution. He said anyone with a blocked nose should give it up after four to five days and use a moisturizing seawater-based spray instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the nasal mucosa quickly adapts to decongestant active ingredients, which cause the blood vessels in the lining to constrict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point you can’t breathe without the spray, so you have to make sure you always have it with you,” says Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmacist said he repeatedly encounters people who have developed a nasal spray dependency. Coming off it can be hard, he says. “After all, everyone wants to be able to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a nasal spray after your cold has gone also has other unwanted effects. Over time, decongestant sprays dry out the nasal mucosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This not only risks bleeding, but also greater susceptibility to infection, because pathogens can penetrate more easily,” Schmitz explains. Important protective functions of the nose then work only to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to wean the nasal lining off decongestant sprays? The classic tip is to switch first to a children’s version, which contains less active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the nose has adjusted to the lower dose, the next step is to switch to a seawater nasal spray that contains no active ingredient at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plan does not always work. “Many have had this adaptation for years. Then those are steps that are too big,” said Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case he advised seeking help at a pharmacy. “We can dilute the nasal spray. Then you wean yourself off in really tiny steps until you eventually reach 0.0%, that is the seawater nasal spray.” How long this takes depends on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with decongestant sprays, seawater sprays don’t bring the risk of the nasal lining becoming dependent, since these simply have a moisturizing effect.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The secret to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-hair-could-make-the-ultimate-toothpaste"&gt;preventing tooth decay&lt;/a&gt; may have been hiding in your mouth all along. Increasing levels of an amino acid in saliva can turn bacterial biofilms from damaging to protective, a clinical study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar doesn't directly harm your teeth – but it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbiologists-explain-what-happens-in-your-mouth-when-you-eat-sugar"&gt;attracts and feeds bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that do. These bugs excrete acidic substances that then get to work dissolving tooth enamel. The issue is worsened by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbes-can-form-superorganisms-that-crawl-across-our-teeth"&gt;bacterial biofilms&lt;/a&gt; that form on tooth surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the recent study from researchers at Aarhus University in Denmark has found a way to switch the balance of power among mouth microbes back in our favor. The key is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid that's naturally found in saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/silencing-bacterial-chatter-in-your-mouth-may-help-prevent-tooth-decay"&gt;Silencing Bacterial 'Chatter' in Your Mouth May Help Prevent Tooth Decay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with active tooth decay, regular arginine treatment significantly reduced the acidity of bacterial biofilms, by changing the ratios of sugars and bacteria populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results revealed differences in acidity of the biofilms, with the ones treated with arginine being significantly more protected against acidification caused by sugar metabolism," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yumi Del Rey, microbiologist at Aarhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10005-2693"&gt;Plenty of previous research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested arginine plays a role in keeping tooth decay at bay, but most studies have been conducted in lab experiments. The Aarhus University study was designed to test whether the same effects occur in real-world environments of human mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188581" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-642x192.jpeg" alt="A Secret Ingredient For Preventing Tooth Decay Might Be in Your Mouth Already" class="wp-image-188581 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-642x192.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-1200x360.jpeg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-768x230.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-1536x460.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-600x180.jpeg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay.jpeg 1898w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A diagram illustrating the dentures designed to grow biofilms and how they were treated. (Del Rey et al., &lt;em&gt;Int. J. Oral Sci.&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten participants wore dentures over their lower teeth for four days, which had tiny panels on either side that allowed biofilms to form. Three times a day, the dentures were removed for treatment in a dipping device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the biofilm panels were bathed in a solution containing 10 percent sucrose. Then, one side was treated with an arginine solution while the other was dunked in plain old distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four days, the dentures were removed and the biofilms examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The aim was to investigate the impact of arginine treatment on the acidity, type of bacteria, and the carbohydrate matrix of biofilms from patients with active caries," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sebastian Schlafer, microbiologist at Aarhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the biofilms were exposed to sugar again, those treated with arginine consistently showed higher pH levels. If you remember your high school chemistry days, a higher pH means lower acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team investigated how arginine might be reducing acidity, by taking stock of which bacteria and sugars were present in each sample. Biofilms treated with arginine showed lower levels of a sugar called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucose"&gt;fucose&lt;/a&gt;, while another sugar, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"&gt;galactose&lt;/a&gt;, was concentrated towards the outer surface of the biofilm – in other words, away from the tooth surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the DNA of bacteria present, the researchers found that arginine treatment significantly reduced a specific population of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bacteria that produce acid, while slightly increasing other bacterial strains that can metabolize arginine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, results seemed to vary from person to person. Some participants didn't respond to treatment, and the researchers were unable to link this variability to clear differences in populations of microbes or sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work will need to be done to investigate how arginine affects biofilms, but the amino acid could be a promising new addition to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-newly-discovered-bacteria-can-help-prevent-cavities-and-scientists-want-to-put-them-in-a-pill"&gt;oral hygiene products&lt;/a&gt; like toothpaste or mouthwash. And it's already considered safe – not only is arginine naturally present, but it's also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;used to treat conditions&lt;/a&gt; like high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-025-00404-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Journal of Oral Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the mid-1990s, the rate was 63%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92f642" class="body-graf"&gt;The 70% figure is based on diagnoses from 2015 to 2021. The findings were published Tuesday in the American Cancer Society’s medical journal, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b3fae" class="body-graf"&gt;Five years is the most common benchmark for measuring cancer survival, since the risk of certain cancers’ recurring declines significantly if the cancers haven’t come back within that time.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a09bc" class="body-graf"&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038" target="_blank"&gt;improved treatment options&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade, many cancers have gone from death sentences to chronic diseases, according to the report’s lead author, Rebecca Siegel, the American Cancer Society’s senior scientific director of surveillance research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a649fa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It takes decades for research to understand and develop these more effective treatments, and now we’re seeing the fruits of those investments,” Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cd0ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The report estimates that 4.8 million cancer deaths were prevented from 1991 to 2023, largely because of better treatments, earlier detection methods and reductions in smoking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86dfd3" class="body-graf"&gt;Siegel said scientists have a greater understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/fat-cells-breast-cancer-tumors-triple-negative-risk-overweight-rcna225598" target="_blank"&gt;how cancer develops and spreads&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to engineer the immune system to stop or slow cancer growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d185f9" class="body-graf"&gt;She highlighted immunotherapies as one of the biggest advances — the treatments help the immune system find and attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy has been “game changing” for myeloma, Siegel said. The five-year survival rate for the blood cancer, which is twice as common among Black people as in white people in the U.S., rose to 62% from 32% in the mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-475727" class="body-graf"&gt;Targeted therapy, which targets specific genes or proteins that help cancer cells grow, has been &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-fighting-antibodies-inject-chemo-directly-tumor-cells-upping-ef-rcna153773" target="_blank"&gt;another major advancement&lt;/a&gt;, as such treatments cause less damage to healthy cells and come with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f51dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Staying on treatment longer allows patients to live longer, and these less toxic treatments allow more sequences of therapy,” said Dr. Christopher Flowers, head of cancer medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn’t involved in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c3e2c" class="body-graf"&gt;Flowers said targeted therapies and immunotherapies have improved survival outcomes for lung cancer, which kills more people than any other cancer in the U.S. The five-year survival rate for regional lung cancer — which is found in the lung and nearby structures or lymph nodes — is now 37%, up from 20% in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73f5d7" class="body-graf"&gt;However, further progress could be made by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/ultra-processed-foods-linked-increased-risk-precancerous-polyps-study-rcna243574" target="_blank"&gt;addressing major risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, said Dr. Clark Gamblin, a gastrointestinal surgeon at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and chief of surgical oncology at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-043a73" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our country has an epidemic of obesity, and cancers follow that,” said Gamblin, who wasn’t involved in the report. “So we’re not winning on every front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0edb7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Colorectal cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-rates-rising-young-people-deaths-diagnosis-rcna233805" target="_blank"&gt;rising in people under age 50&lt;/a&gt;, and overall breast cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-cases-increasing-women-declining-men-report-rcna187586" target="_blank"&gt;rising among women&lt;/a&gt;. Obesity can be a risk factor for both cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-081f56" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be more than 626,000 cancer deaths and more than 2.1 million newly diagnosed cases in the U.S. this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91112f" class="body-graf"&gt;Siegel said she is concerned about scientists’ ability to study new methods of prevention, detection and treatment, given recent cuts to cancer research by the Trump administration. An &lt;a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/HELP-Committee-Minority-Report-Trumps-War-on-Science.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analysis from Democrats&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee found a 31% decline in cancer research grant funding in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a6713" class="body-graf"&gt;“Other threats to progress are the enormous gap that we see in the cancer burden in people of color, specifically Native American people and Black people,” Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f3fb2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The same populations are among the most affected by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-leaves-town-2026-no-health-care-deal-forcing-premium-hikes-rcna249817" target="_blank"&gt;the expiration of Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies&lt;/a&gt;, which could reduce access to cancer drugs, Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e8eb17" class="body-graf"&gt;Disruptions to cancer screening during the Covid pandemic could also have further effects, including late-stage diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-223f85" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The screening for [asymptomatic] cancer largely stopped during that time period, and I don’t know that we’ve seen the tail of that yet,” Gamblin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPaGtvQlhiUTF1SEF2TUZwdGQ2TkhnRFBwU3B1dTladFJrdzNwVFpmdldhWGNReGNFRDlZeHdwVWp0MFN5RVk1UkZqZ3hIb2VjN3RmNldwOW1yY0thZ1dRRXRKVElhbEotMWpjVXBkc0Z6VTQ5ZGlrOEpJNEtveTNudWVDNkRLa2xZQnBmd2tzbzhDQVl0cXNheTNDalNydw</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州是全国流感发病率最高的州之一–一名急诊室医生描述了为什么2025-26年流感季节受到重创- The Conversation</title><link>https://theconversation.com/colorado-ranks-among-the-highest-states-in-the-country-for-flu-an-emergency-room-physician-describes-why-the-2025-26-flu-season-is-hitting-hard-273069</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colorado is in the midst of a record-breaking flu season. In the week ending Dec. 27, 2025, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report"&gt;831 people were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; with influenza – the most since the state started &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1506.081645"&gt;tracking flu cases two decades ago&lt;/a&gt;. Hospitalizations eased the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report"&gt;following week to 737&lt;/a&gt; but still remain higher than prior years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colorado is among the top five states with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html"&gt;the most flu activity in the country&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/doctor-visits-for-flu-hit-highest-level-in-almost-30-years/"&gt;doctor’s visits for flu-like illness at a 30-year record high&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html"&gt;weekly influenza surveillance report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m an &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24314"&gt;emergency medicine and critical care physician&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Colorado. In my 18 years of practicing clinical medicine, this year is one of the worst I have seen. Our emergency department hit a record number of single-day total visits over the holidays, and visit volumes have stayed high. Flu is likely contributing to this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is always a season where respiratory viruses hit hard, this year influenza is making patients miserable and wreaking havoc on both the state and national health care system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does this year’s ‘super flu’ differ from other flu seasons?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/31/colorado-rough-flu-season-explained/"&gt;season is especially rough&lt;/a&gt; because of the volume of people seeking emergency care. This flu came on fast and seems to be very contagious, and its symptoms are more severe than other recent years’ flu strains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu tends to cause fever, body aches and maybe a cough. But this so-called super flu has also caused vomiting and diarrhea, which has made people feel much worse than isolated respiratory symptoms alone. When people are feeling worse, they seek emergency care, which is part of why our emergency department is seeing so many people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past flu seasons, which typically run from October through February, emergency rooms were full because they were facing multiple outbreaks, such as the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/flu-rsv-and-covid-19-advice-from-family-doctors-on-how-to-get-through-this-winters-tripledemic-195088"&gt;2022 “tripledemic” of COVID-19, flu and RSV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this 2025-26 flu season, we’re seeing high emergency department visits specifically from the flu. The first group of patients we’re seeing are healthy people who are feeling worse with this flu, which comes with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and come to the emergency department looking for symptomatic relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group are those with severe manifestations of the flu or who have underlying comorbidities such as asthma or heart disease that can be exacerbated by influenza. This is a population that may require oxygen, or they’re a transplant patient and they’re requiring hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This double whammy of people feeling really miserable from their symptoms plus people with comorbidities experiencing complications is when you really see a strain on the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRpqvuOm1NM?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The CDC ranks Colorado’s flu activity among the highest in the U.S., along with Louisiana, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are any age groups being hit harder than others?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is seeing the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;highest number of visits to emergency departments&lt;/a&gt; in children ages 5 to 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids generally seem to be having milder flu cases than adults, which is typical for some of these viruses. But there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html"&gt;17 pediatric deaths associated with influenza&lt;/a&gt; across the U.S., with eight in the week ending January 3. That number of deaths in children is not typical at this point in the season.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young people in their 20s are feeling pretty bad from this year’s flu, but we’re not seeing a lot of complications or hospitalizations in this group across the U.S. and in emergency departments in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing a lot of people who have underlying conditions, such as asthma, as well as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and those who are immune-compromised. They get the flu, and then it leads to kind of a cascade, or a worsening of their underlying medical problems. This is different from what we saw with COVID-19, where &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53590"&gt;healthy people got very, very sick from COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm"&gt;older you get, the more likely&lt;/a&gt; you are to experience complications, such as needing oxygen, which typically requires hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are you still encouraging people to get the flu shot if they haven’t yet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you should still consider getting your flu shot, especially if you have medical problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting an &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/influenza"&gt;annual, updated flu shot&lt;/a&gt; helps with severity of diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/how-does-the-flu-vaccine-work"&gt;even if it doesn’t provide total protection&lt;/a&gt;. Especially if you have underlying conditions, it’s important to do everything you can to decrease symptom severity, duration and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/flu-shot-more-than-good-enough-says-expert/"&gt;risk of hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Getting the flu shot reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization, especially for people who are older or have other medical conditions.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/dr-gaurav-shinde-gives-giti-noroozi-her-vaccinations-for-news-photo/2169740399?adppopup=true"&gt;Genaro Molina/Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When should you consider going to an emergency room?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anytime breathing becomes difficult, or you experience severe chest pain or headaches that are abnormal, that’s something that we want you to seek medical care for right away. And of course, if somebody’s worried about a symptom, we’re here 365 days a year, and we’re happy to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling bad – such as a mild headache, body aches, fever, sometimes some cough and congestion, and as I mentioned with this flu, potentially vomiting and diarrhea – that is very normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s flu, COVID-19 or RSV in a healthy, mildly symptomatic patient, it doesn’t really matter what they have, because there’s not a specific treatment. There’s not anything that we can do that’s going to make them better, other than “tincture of time,” meaning lots of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have underlying medical problems, such as diabetes, lung problems or are immune-compromised, and you are experiencing severe symptoms, you should at the very least see your primary care doctor if not the emergency department. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it important to get tested for the sake of knowing what you have?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of patients want to know what virus they have, but if you’re young and healthy, there’s not really a need for testing other than surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colorado’s infectious disease trackers say wastewater surveillance is the No. 1 way to figure out what infectious diseases are in the community. We can’t get a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/testing-methods/consider-influenza-testing.html"&gt;comprehensive sample through hospitals and clinics&lt;/a&gt;, because there are so many people who are home, don’t get tested and do not seek health care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;In Colorado and other states, wastewater is tested for infectious pathogens, including influenza, COVID-19 and RSV. This testing indicates the prevalence of a virus in a given community.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/brian-leighton-chief-operator-at-yarmouth-wastewater-news-photo/1237975362?adppopup=true"&gt;Portland Press Herald/Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/dcphr/wastewater#dboard1"&gt;wastewater samples in Colorado are testing extraordinarily high&lt;/a&gt; for the flu and pretty low for RSV and COVID-19. Wastewater is a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/wastewater-monitoring-took-off-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-heres-how-it-could-help-head-off-future-outbreaks-180775"&gt;very reliable test&lt;/a&gt; because everybody produces wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it’s important for the overall health care system that laboratory testing be used judiciously. Testing does help us understand what’s in the community. But from a hospital and emergency department lens, the more tests we send to the lab that have to be run, the more testing services for other illnesses get backed up. It also adds a burden to nursing and other clinical staff, as well as costs for the patient and hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if a patient is sick with manageable symptoms from a virus, it’s the same standard advice: Stay at home, wash your hands and consider a mask if you have to go out in public.&lt;/p&gt;

While this marks a large decrease, it does not mean the flu has peaked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What the CDC is saying is that people weren’t seeking care during the holidays,” Teichman explained. This is likely the reason behind the drop in cases, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people were sick with the flu but not getting tested, flu rates would appear lower — even if they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sood added that folks who already had time off from work for the holidays may have decided to get better at home and not seek testing or treatment. So, if folks were off the week between Christmas and New Year’s, flu rates through early January may appear lower than they actually are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not really clear if the cases are going down because the actual incidence of infection is going down, which I hope is the case, or if it’s just backlog or less people seeking care and testing during the holidays and right after the holidays,” Sood added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see that cases may be starting to tail off, but I would caution people that it’s still early days ... we would want to see a continuing trend, a downward trend, before we let down our guard,” said &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1636/daniel-kuritzkes-infectious_disease-boston" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Daniel R.

We are not at peak yet ... most commonly we peak in February, but we’ll see,” Teichman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rough flu season is likely being caused by “a slight mismatch” between the prevalent circulating flu strain and the flu shot, according to Kuritzkes. This is because a new flu strain emerged after the flu shot formulation was decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu hospitalizations and deaths are up throughout the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths from the flu are up from the prior week, according to the most recent CDC data. Experts say this makes sense after the particularly high surge in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always say that hospitalization and mortality are lagging indicators because people have to have caught the flu and then progressed to the point where they’re sick enough to be hospitalized,” Kuritzkes noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt; If you are not feeling well, stay home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to avoid getting the flu? Here’s what you can do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should still be continuing to take all the precautions that they ordinarily would, in terms of careful attention to washing your hands when you come in from being out and about, wearing a mask if you’re in crowded indoor circumstances, staying away from people who are coughing and sneezing,” Kuritzkes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try also to avoid contact with high-touch surfaces, Teichman suggested. For instance, if you’re out and about, use your sleeve to open doors or press elevator buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not feeling well, stay home. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/early-symptoms-flu_l_695e6cb5e4b05bed6f971f03" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Common flu symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696118bde4b0120ab25d1957" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="695e6cb5e4b05bed6f971f03" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Common flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt; include fever, body aches, headaches and a sore throat.

That recommendation aimed at meeting the nutritional needs of an average, sedentary adult. Now, the new dietary guidelines suggest people should consume between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kg of body weight per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="294adb53-b72c-4cc4-bed4-0c6e10209ca1-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;So, to meet the new recommendations, a person weighing 154 pounds (70 kg) would need to consume around 84 to 112 grams (3 to 4 ounces) of protein per day, as opposed to 56 grams (2 ounces) under the old recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9910b224-835c-4c64-85fc-0e45a36f1f6d"&gt;"It is unclear why the [Dietary Guidelines for Americans] increased the recommendation by 50% to 100%," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/alice-lichtenstein" target="_blank" data-url="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/alice-lichtenstein" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alice Lichtenstein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an American Heart Association fellow and nutrition science professor at Tufts University, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, scientists previously estimated that the average U.S. adult's protein consumption generally exceeded the old guideline.

And is there an upper limit you shouldn't cross?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts told Live Science that there's no single, agreed-upon maximum amount of protein you can eat in a day. That said, if you're not particularly active, pushing your protein intake beyond what the old recommendation suggested is unlikely to be very beneficial, they said. Additionally, it would be harmful to boost your protein intake at the expense of eating other macronutrients, like fat and carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UG2BUSR6ibVd8GeKSuyAe4" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-UG2BUSR6ibVd8GeKSuyAe4 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-0aac02b5-8859-49ac-9e7c-6057c35c35b8" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-protein-important-3"&gt;Why is protein important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="47524dba-9b60-4de7-a8cf-b3fcfbb9a8fa"&gt;Proteins are the body's building blocks, forming everything from muscles and hormones to digestive enzymes and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-high-protein-foods" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-are-high-protein-foods"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Protein-rich foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include meat, fish and eggs, as well as tofu, beans and nuts. The proteins in these foods get broken down by our bodies into their component parts — amino acids — which cells can use to produce the proteins we need. While the body can produce some amino acids on its own, there are nine, called essential amino acids, that we can get only through our diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A given person's protein requirements vary depending on a number of factors, with one of the more crucial ones being how much they exercise. So generally, increases in protein intake should be accompanied by increases in activity levels, Lichtenstein told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the studies that I am aware of have not demonstrated that increasing protein intake above current recommendations increases lean muscle mass," she said. "If it does, it needs to be coupled with certain types of physical activity, not a strong point for most people." Those types of activity might &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-weight-training" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-weight-training"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include strength&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/boost-your-running-speed-with-training-but-dont-fall-for-these-myths-scientists-say" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/boost-your-running-speed-with-training-but-dont-fall-for-these-myths-scientists-say"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endurance training&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;it's been recommended that&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people who regularly exercise get about 1.1 to 1.5 grams per kg per day, while people training for athletic events might eat up to 1.7 grams per kg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, active people still need to take in adequate energy from carbs and fats. If they don't, the body may resort to using amino acids as fuel, effectively &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iris.who.int/items/78c03092-bcc2-40f5-90d1-60641ecdf6ea" target="_blank" data-url="https://iris.who.int/items/78c03092-bcc2-40f5-90d1-60641ecdf6ea" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increasing the amount of protein they need&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make up for the loss of protein building blocks in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor that influences our protein requirements is age.

This could boost the risk of heart attack or stroke. Based on this finding, the study authors suggested that getting more than 22% of your daily calories from protein — around 1.6 grams per kg of body weight — could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leucine is found in a variety of animal- and plant-based protein sources. Additionally, protein sources that are high in purine — such as red meat, organs like kidney, and certain types of seafood — can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17808-hyperuricemia-high-uric-acid-level" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17808-hyperuricemia-high-uric-acid-level" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead to gout and kidney stones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important to note that there is no single, official upper limit," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nutritionnews.abbott/media-center/our-experts/bridget-cassady/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nutritionnews.abbott/media-center/our-experts/bridget-cassady/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bridget Cassady&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) at Abbott, told Live Science in an email. "An amount that is considered 'excessive' will be different based on your needs varying with age, body weight, activity level, health status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="81109280-9dc7-4f36-88a3-1daf9cf296c9"&gt;Broadly speaking, though, Cassady said that healthy individuals can safely consume "moderately high" amounts of protein — around 2 grams per kg per day — as long as it's part of a balanced diet. Protein consumption should not come at the expense of other nutrients; if it starts crowding out fiber-rich plants, healthy fats, or whole-food carbohydrates, that's when protein intake could start becoming a concern, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the extreme, a super high-protein diet could put strain on the kidneys, which can filter only so much urea — a protein waste product — from the blood at a given time. That's why people with existing kidney problems are advised to avoid high-protein diets, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-you-eat-too-much-protein" target="_blank" data-url="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-you-eat-too-much-protein" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according to Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Congratulations: you have the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Every winter in the US has its share of flu cases, but this season is shaping up to be particularly bad. Early this week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-says-2025-26-flu-season-moderately-severe-cases-hit-11-million-2026-01-05/"&gt;put the flu season&lt;/a&gt; in the “moderately severe” category, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;with an estimated&lt;/a&gt; 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths so far. Here in New York, where I live, the city kicked off 2026 by &lt;a href="https://health.ny.gov/press/releases/2026/2026-01-02_flu_hospitalizations.htm"&gt;setting records&lt;/a&gt; for flu-related hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While what we’re experiencing is not a “&lt;a href="https://news.nova.edu/in-the-news/nsu-professor-shares-insight-on-super-flu-and-its-nationwide-impact/"&gt;super flu,&lt;/a&gt;” it is a particularly bad one, thanks in part to the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/superflu-or-same-old-flu-how-subclade-k-influenza-playing-out-worldwide"&gt;emergence of a subgroup&lt;/a&gt; of the well-established H3N2 flu virus called &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/should-you-still-get-the-flu-shot-despite-the-new-strain-heres-why-doctors-recommend-it"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;. It carries a bunch of mutations that seem to have rendered the current flu vaccine somewhat less effective. (Though far from completely ineffective — more on that below.) Nor does it help that only around 44 percent of US adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html#:~:text=As%20of%20December%2027%2C%202025%2C%2043.5%25%20(95%25,definitely%20will%20get%20a%20vaccine."&gt;have taken the flu shot&lt;/a&gt; so far, well below vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/vaccination-2019-2020.html"&gt;before the Covid pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The decline has been particularly sharp for children, who are more vulnerable to the flu, which has resulted in &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34114/CDC-9-children-have-died-of-flu-this-season?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;higher than normal pediatric hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As bad as this season is shaping up to be, chances are most of us will suffer through it and then forget until the next year comes around. After all, it’s just the flu, right? But even normal influenza is far more than just a seasonal nuisance. The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-%28seasonal%29?"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that there are around &lt;em&gt;1 billion &lt;/em&gt;flu infections in a given year, which can lead to as many as 5 million severe cases and up to 650,000 flu-related respiratory deaths per year, mostly among the very young and the very old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The burden of flu goes beyond those numbers: CDC research &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-flu-heart-study.html"&gt;indicates&lt;/a&gt; that flu infections can raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Plus all those sick days &lt;a href="https://www.challengergray.com/blog/flu-workplace-about-7b-lost-productivity/#:~:text=Online%20resource%2C%20Flu.gov%2C,billion%20annually%20in%20lost%20productivity."&gt;add up&lt;/a&gt; to as much as 111 million lost work days in the US alone, while childhood infections &lt;a href="https://familiesfightingflu.org/the-hidden-burden-of-flu-on-families-health-time-economics/"&gt;lead to more school absences&lt;/a&gt; and a knock-on effect for parents forced to stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Oh, and chances are decent that the (inevitable) next global pandemic will come from a mutant flu virus, just like past pandemics in 2009, 1968, 1957, and the granddaddy of them all, 1918, which killed &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/spanish-flu-largest-influenza-pandemic-in-history#:~:text=The%20widely%20cited%20study%20by,6"&gt;at least 50 million people&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So that’s the bad news. The good news? There are ways to protect yourself right now — and even more promising, glimmers on the scientific frontier of a world without flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-works-and-what-doesnt-with-the-flu-shot" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What works — and what doesn’t — with the flu shot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The simplest way to keep safe is, of course, to get your flu shot. Like right now — even though the flu season is well underway, it’s worth getting your shot if you haven’t yet. Early data from the UK &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6924637090a8c154e902625a/_WITHDRAWN__Flu_interimVE_2526.pdf"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; protection rates against hospital admission of 70 to 75 percent for children and 30 to 35 percent in adults. That’s normal: The standard flu vaccine isn’t great at preventing cases, but it is very effective in reducing the severity of illness. Throw in the fact that you can now &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/at-home-covid-test-kits/"&gt;easily get an at-home flu test&lt;/a&gt; and secure the antiviral Tamiflu early in an illness, and you do have the power to ensure your case is milder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it is true flu shots are not our most effective class of vaccine. That largely has to do with the nature of the flu, and how the shots are made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Influenza is what you might call a “promiscuous” virus. Strains are constantly evolving, and can easily swap genetic material through a process called reassortment to create new, potentially more dangerous viruses. Because of that, international health officials have to create a new vaccine strain every year, hoping that it will match the strain actually circulating months later when vaccines are available for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If the dominant strain changes during those months, the vaccine will be less effective. And any vaccine that has to be taken over and over again on an annual basis is going to be a harder sell to the public, even before taking into account &lt;a href="/the-logoff-newsletter-trump/474084/trump-kennedy-childhood-vaccine-schedule-denmark-change-explained"&gt;rising anti-vax sentiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s already progress being made to reduce the time between when a vaccine strain is selected and when it can be produced, chiefly by &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/moderna-announces-promising-efficacy-results-mrna-flu-vaccine-trial"&gt;using rapid mRNA platforms&lt;/a&gt; rather than growing vaccines in eggs, as has been done for decades. But even better: What if it were possible to create a flu vaccine that was effective against a wide variety of different flu strains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-dream-of-a-universal-flu-vaccine" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The dream of a universal flu vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-02-strategic-universal-influenza-vaccine.pdf"&gt;“universal” flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is one that would be at least 75 percent effective against influenza A viruses and provide durable protection for at least a year (though ideally longer). In other words, it would be a vaccine that would act more like the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/expert-answers/getting-measles-after-vaccination/faq-20125397"&gt;almost perfectly protective measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and less like, well, a flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Such “universal” flu coverage would not be one single breakthrough, but a portfolio of strategies for outsmarting a virus that mutates faster than our annual vaccine calendar. The first bucket is &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/universal-influenza-vaccine-research"&gt;universal (or universal-ish) vaccines&lt;/a&gt;: instead of training antibodies mainly against flu’s fast-changing hemagglutinin (HA) “head,” researchers are trying to steer immunity toward viral targets that mutate less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One major approach &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ade4790"&gt;focuses on the HA stem or stalk&lt;/a&gt;, a region of the virus that changes more slowly; early human trials of stem-focused designs suggest these vaccines can be safe and elicit broadly reactive immune responses. Another vaccine strategy uses &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/vrc-uni-flu-vax"&gt;mosaic/nanoparticle displays&lt;/a&gt; that present HA antigens from multiple strains at once, aiming to teach the immune system to recognize flu’s common features rather than this year’s exact variant; the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/experimental-influenza-vaccine-flumos-v2-study"&gt;FluMos program&lt;/a&gt; is an example now in early clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/evaluating-dose-safety-tolerability-and-immunogenicity-mosaic-hexavalent-influenza"&gt;third line&lt;/a&gt; leans on broader immune mechanisms: targeting neuraminidase (NA) (the N in HN flu viruses), or boosting T-cell responses to internal proteins that rarely change, which may not always prevent infection but could make illness far less severe when the virus drifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s also the “universal without a vaccine” lane: prevention and treatment that don’t depend on your immune system’s memory. Cidara, a San Diego-based biotech company, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01955-3.pdf"&gt;has developed&lt;/a&gt; a long-acting preventive designed to provide season-long protection by chemically linking multiple copies of a neuraminidase inhibitor to a long-lasting antibody. Preclinical work has shown broad resistance to influenza A and B, and the company’s approach is promising enough that it is now in the process of being &lt;a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-to-complete-acquisition-of-cidara-therapeutics/"&gt;acquired by pharma giant Merck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even more sci-fi: using gene editing to create all-purpose flu treatments. Scientists in Australia are working on using the gene editing tool Crispr &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crispr-flu-antivirals/"&gt;to develop&lt;/a&gt; an antiviral nasal spray that could shut down a wide variety of flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="we-shouldnt-have-to-live-with-the-flu" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;We shouldn’t have to live with the flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Historically, the US &lt;a href="http://google.com/search?q=Bryan+walsh+bloomberg+flu+vaccine&amp;amp;oq=Bryan+walsh+bloomberg+flu+vaccine&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCDQ4MzhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;hasn’t allocated&lt;/a&gt; nearly enough money to universal flu prevention research, though in May the Trump administration surprised scientists with &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20administration%E2%80%99s%20unprecedented%20%24500,Human%20Services%20Secretary%20Robert%20F."&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; to spend $500 million on an approach that relies on older vaccine technology. Except in those rare years when a flu pandemic boils over, we tend to treat flu as something we just have to suffer through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But hundreds of thousands of people globally each year won’t survive their bouts with the flu, and millions more will suffer because of the viruses. We’ve managed to all but knock out past killers like smallpox, the measles, and the mumps (Well, provided we agree to take our vaccines.)

			&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos, widely used on US farms, has been linked to a more than 2.5-fold increase in the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding comes from a large community-based case–control study led by scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The team also used animal models to identify the specific &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/prion-like-brain-damage-can-occur-without-infectious-prions-study-finds"&gt;kinds of brain damage&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorpyrifos"&gt;chlorpyrifos&lt;/a&gt; might cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-230357"&gt;existing concerns&lt;/a&gt; around pesticides and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="188495" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, although establishing long-term chemical exposure and separating it from other risk factors, such as genetics, can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-discovery-suggests-we-may-have-an-fda-approved-treatment-already"&gt;Parkinson's Discovery Suggests We May Have an FDA-Approved Treatment Already&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study establishes chlorpyrifos as a specific environmental risk factor for Parkinson's disease, not just pesticides as a general class," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/widely-used-pesticide-linked-more-doubled-parkinsons-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Jeff Bronstein, from UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared 829 people diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/men-have-higher-risk-of-parkinsons-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; with 824 people without the condition. By combining participants' home and workplace addresses with California pesticide-use records dating back to 1974, the team estimated each person's exposure to chlorpyrifos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with the highest workplace exposure for the longest periods had 2.74 times higher odds of developing Parkinson's, compared with people who had minimal or no exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the risk rose significantly for exposure going back more than a decade, consistent with the development of Parkinson's, which often starts many years &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-voice-could-hide-the-tell-tale-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;before symptoms appear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188498" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainProteins.jpg" alt="Protein in mouse brains" class="wp-image-188498 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainProteins-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188498" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alpha-synuclein proteins (in green) were more abundant after exposure to chlorpyrifos (bottom row) in mouse brains. (Hasan et al., &lt;em&gt;Mol. Neurodegener.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether the association might be causal, the team conducted experiments in mice and zebrafish. Mice exposed to chlorpyrifos showed signs of impaired movement, and lost dopamine-producing neurons in their brain – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;a hallmark of Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clumps of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-synuclein"&gt;alpha-synuclein protein&lt;/a&gt; were also seen in the mouse brains – again matching pathological markers of Parkinson's. In zebrafish, chlorpyrifos interfered with autophagy, a key cellular waste-disposal process. When the researchers stimulated autophagy, neurons were better protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That link between chlorpyrifos and autophagy is significant: Several &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13101435"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown autophagy may be one of the pathways driving Parkinson's-related brain damage, and it might be the route chlorpyrifos chemicals take, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By showing the biological mechanism in animal models, we've demonstrated that this association is likely causal," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/widely-used-pesticide-linked-more-doubled-parkinsons-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bronstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chlorpyrifos has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-pesticide-linked-to-widespread-brain-abnormalities-in-children"&gt;already been linked&lt;/a&gt; to brain abnormalities in children and is banned in the UK and the European Union. In the US, its use has been somewhat restricted in recent decades, but the pesticide is still applied to food crops in many states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks increasingly likely that chlorpyrifos contributes to Parkinson's risk, but it's only one factor among many. While it's not clear how Parkinson's gets started, we do know that risk factors include the genes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-genetic-mutation-that-seems-to-protect-against-parkinsons"&gt;we're born with&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-6-sleep-traits-to-risk-of-172-diseases"&gt;poor quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and even how close &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/controversial-new-study-links-parkinsons-with-living-near-a-golf-course"&gt;we live to a golf course&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps due to pesticide use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers hope to look at other types of pesticides and their potential effects on the brain. They also want to explore whether treatments that prevent disruption of autophagy could protect against the damage caused by chlorpyrifos exposure and perhaps even slow &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;Parkinson's progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The discovery that autophagy dysfunction drives the neurotoxicity also points us toward potential therapeutic strategies to protect vulnerable brain cells," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/widely-used-pesticide-linked-more-doubled-parkinsons-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bronstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-025-00915-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Neurodegeneration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/essential-healthy-habits-for-your-twenties-thirties-longevity-advice-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;how simple habits&lt;/a&gt; can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt; and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-uncover-processed-foods-fuel-colon-cancer-how-offset-damage-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and refined sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider  that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: "how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are his three suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;h2 id="f1426ea8-76ac-4bb4-9967-f82aaa75bb88" data-toc-id="f1426ea8-76ac-4bb4-9967-f82aaa75bb88"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Switch from cooking with butter to olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;

                      Olive oil contains heart-healthy fats.

              Lazy_Bear/Getty Images
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Landry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal products and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/government-eat-more-butter-full-fat-milk-dietary-guidelines-dairy-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;full-fat dairy products&lt;/a&gt; like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or "bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="92ff2c6c-ba8f-4601-94f3-06f8a5c0fe3b" data-toc-id="92ff2c6c-ba8f-4601-94f3-06f8a5c0fe3b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Switch from red meat to poultry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled "You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/omnivore-vs-vegan-diet-vegan-lost-more-weight-lower-cholesterol-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;vegan twins&lt;/a&gt; had lower LDL cholesterol and insulin levels, and had lost more weight, another risk factor for cardiovascular disease, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. "Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f2310b17-c86f-481d-9b8f-929fd5162d13" data-toc-id="f2310b17-c86f-481d-9b8f-929fd5162d13"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Swap white carbs for whole-wheat versions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      Swap out white toast for wholemeal or seeded bread.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiber is great at keeping &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-lowered-cholesterol-4-simple-ways-eat-more-fiber-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;"nice and stable," Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can still have bread, we can still have rice," Landry, said, "but the whole grain version."&lt;/p&gt;
            
            
            &lt;/section&gt;

Some communities in Brazil may hold the answer. Image credit: heckepics/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil is home to three of the 10 longest-lived male supercentenarians in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new paper explores why Brazil is home to an unusually high number of long-lived individuals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The authors believe distinct genetic and immunological factors may be driving this effect. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of longevity is exploding. You can’t scroll an inch on your social media feed before you come across someone who claims they’ll live to 150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine times out of 10, these people believe they can achieve this by spending huge sums on wellness “hacks,” untested treatments, and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell whether their high-cost, bespoke protocols will extend their lives. Meanwhile, in Brazil, many people — without access to $1,000-per-night wellness clinics or cryotherapy chambers — are routinely living to 100 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite limited access to healthcare, many of these centenarians stay healthy even up until the end of their century-long lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Viewpoint article in the journal &lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/genpsych/aop/article-10.61373-gp026v.0009/article-10.61373-gp026v.0009.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt; describes ongoing genomic and cellular studies on some of these people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research aims to identify the biological signatures associated with surviving to advanced age. Before we dig into the research, here is some terminology:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;centenarians — people aged 100 years or older&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;semisupercentenarians — aged 105–109 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;supercentenarians — aged 110 years or older.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authors begin their paper, “Health span is a global goal.” It is not that people want to live long lives; it is more that they want to live healthy lives for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, individuals who make it to a healthy, advanced age must, by definition, have avoided the many diseases of aging that are some of the biggest killers, including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/237191" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and cancer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying the physiology and genetics of these long-lived individuals could help us develop more effective treatments or preventative approaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the paper, the researchers call out recent research into long-lived individuals and explore some of the biological mechanisms that help keep these people younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/3/2888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;protein maintenance&lt;/a&gt;. As we age, our body’s ability to maintain and refresh the thousands of proteins needed for good health slowly fails. Supercentenarians, however, can clear faulty proteins as efficiently as much younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another mechanism might be tied to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10711357/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;immune protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In general, the immune system of older adults slowly declines, increasing the risk of low-level chronic inflammation and infection. In supercentenarians, however, rather than a decline, their immune system adapts to become &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38143508/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;more resilient&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, some people may simply have &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Cell" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;“good” genes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;: Evidence suggests that long-lived individuals may have certain genetic advantages, harbouring relatively rare gene variants that support a robust immune system, genomic stability, and mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.a4m.com/daniel-ghiyam-medpodla-beverly-hills-ca-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daniel Ghiyam&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified physician at MedPod LA, who was not involved in this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It seems that layered biological resilience, not just one ‘longevity gene,’ is what makes people live longer,” Ghiyam told us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who live very long lives seem to have strong cellular housekeeping systems, such as DNA repair, mitochondrial efficiency, and protein quality control, and they don’t have chronic inflammatory overload,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smarttoolsplus.com/pages/instructor/jamie-bovay-dpt-mtc-cscs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jamie Bovay&lt;/a&gt;, DPT, a doctor of physical therapy and founder of Physical Therapy Solutions, who likewise was not involved in the study, put it simply thus: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of your cells like a high-end kitchen. If you never take the trash out or scrub the counters, the kitchen eventually becomes unusable, no matter how good the ingredients are. Supercentenarians seem to have ‘industrial-strength’ waste management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While females tend to live longer than males, Brazil is home to many of the longest-lived males. According to the authors, three of the 10 longest-lived males in the world are from Brazil. This includes the oldest living man, who was born in 1912.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, they explain, “provides a rare scientific opportunity” to study these unusual individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author’s ongoing research includes biological samples from over 100 centenarians. Importantly, many of these people live in regions where medical care is extremely limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows the researchers to understand the factors associated with longer lives beyond the reach of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The paper explains how one of the factors that could play a role in the extreme lifespans of certain Brazilians is their unique origin. According to the authors, Brazil has the richest genetic diversity of any country, due to waves of immigrants from all across Europe, Japan, and Africa.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This complex tapestry of ancestries,” they write, “has resulted in a highly admixed population, with unique genomic patterns that may influence multifactorial traits such as biological resilience and longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research, the scientists hope, will provide biological and genetic information that will help them understand how we might all age more healthily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we wait for the data to roll in, what can people who live elsewhere in the world do to extend their lives? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who were not involved in the study offered some of their longevity tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize metabolism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Putting metabolic health first, keeping muscle mass, keeping the immune system healthy, and reducing chronic inflammation are all important,” Ghiyam explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This means getting enough protein, doing strength and aerobic exercises on a regular basis, getting good sleep, and taking steps to lower your risk of heart disease. It’s just as important to avoid smoking, eat less ultra-processed foods, and deal with stress,” he told us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the role of physical activity, Bovay emphasized the importance of building our “Structural Armor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The paper mentions that many of these supercentenarians were still independent in daily activities. Muscle is the currency of longevity. If you want to live to 100, you need to lift heavy things now,” he advised, adding that “high bone density and muscle mass are the best predictors of surviving a health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The power of walking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usph.com/were-excited-to-announce-our-new-department-of-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Milica McDowell&lt;/a&gt;, PT, MPT, DPT, a doctor of physical therapy, believes walking can have a powerful effect on healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Walking needs to be a daily activity,” McDowell told us. “Those who walk more have better longevity because it reduces the risk of cardiac disease and cardiac death.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;One large-scale study&lt;/a&gt;,” she continued, “demonstrated that if people who walk 2,500 steps a day add an extra 500 steps each day, it reduces the risk of death by 7%. If they add 1,000 steps per day, it reduces their risk of death by 15%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6 pillars of lifestyle medicine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://switch4good.org/team-member/david-goldman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David Goldman&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, a sports dietitian, research scientist, and chief science advisor at Switch4Good recommended making one small change at a time and focusing on six pillars of lifestyle medicine: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;eat whole, plant-predominant foods — vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds — while minimizing meat and salt consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stay active with cardio, strength training, and stretching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;get 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;manage stress with mindfulness or breathing exercises&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;keep strong social ties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;avoid tobacco and limit alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something about the genetics and lifestyle of people in Brazil appears to keep some of their population younger for longer. Research so far suggests that they have particularly effective cellular housekeeping mechanisms. However, many questions remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who were not born in Brazil, there are healthy science-backed habits you can adopt today that will likely help extend your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making gradual changes that you can stick to can be a powerful tool for longevity. As Goldman told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, “follow these habits as consistently as possible, while being forgiving of slip-ups, and you’ll set yourself up beautifully for a long, healthy life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:41:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPS3BGRldaTnZ0cGlYVjBieDZnaW9ZdVd6ZGUtUUFXWEFiNW1heUs4d09BZVZzbHhtanZqRmVETm43N1RsQWV1Q1M1UTB3RkQ5RWE4MHFTcnFLTzJfdkFFUVpPR0h3dGZaaW0tVWN0RmFBaUJZMm40NGRhRVdXMjhzcWlGMHlLcGgxelQ3UVVRT1Zfc0N5R1o1Yi1B</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，医生认为每6名患者中就有1名“困难” - Becker’s Hospital Review</title><link>https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-experience/physicians-see-1-in-6-patients-as-difficult-study-finds/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Becker's Hospital Review</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 23:03:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOTklZT3ZRVzJBUjltSE4zX0NuU0x1RkNnVzVMclQ3UnpfOGgzNDk0TWd3c1hadFljR2QzYm0xdnk0U0FTcFRWRDN2aEdyc1NCTGdRaWwyamlHRGN6VGtMNkRfLThjbXlqaVRMMXVRLURDZUF6MkJCalJBc3dXb09PNW00QlNMNFVNRnNXbU5NUWhwXzlvZUVQRlIteGRPMC1Zd24zdjg0algwc0RHRDFHX0t3Yw</guid></item><item><title>英国最年轻的痴呆症病例在24岁时死亡- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/youngest-uk-dementia-case-dies-at-24-2000709304</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;An incredibly rare, tragic death in the UK might still have a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Late last December, British resident Andre Yarham died at the age of 24 from an extremely early form of dementia. Yarham was diagnosed with the condition only two years ago, after an MRI scan revealed his brain resembled that of a 70-year-old. His family agreed to donate his body to science, hoping that scientists can learn something from his untimely passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He must have been one of the youngest,” Samantha Fairbairn, Yarham’s mother, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2k9xp5je1go"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the BBC last week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A cruel fate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Fairbairn, her son’s symptoms began to appear around late 2022. He started to easily forget things and behave strangely.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tests showed unusual shrinking in Yarham’s brain, particularly around the frontal and temporal lobes, the regions that help govern personality and language. Eventually, in November 2023, doctors formally diagnosed him with early-onset frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yarham remained relatively active and cognizant following his diagnosis. But by September 2025, he was enrolled in a care home. Within about a month’s time, he was no longer able to walk under his own power and required a wheelchair, and during his last month of life, he completely lost the ability to speak. Finally, on December 27, he passed away.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Dementia is a cruel, cruel disease,” said Fairbairn. “People with cancer, they can have radiotherapy, they can have chemotherapy, and people go into remission and can lead a fruitful, memorable life. With dementia, there’s nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;FTD is relatively uncommon, accounting for about 5% of reported dementia cases. And Yarham’s illness was even more unusual. Only &lt;a href="https://www.dementiauk.org/information-and-support/young-onset-dementia/young-onset-dementia-facts-and-figures/"&gt;about 7.5%&lt;/a&gt; of people living with dementia currently in the UK are early-onset, in which symptoms appear before the age of 65. But most of these cases still occur after age 30, while the typical onset of FTD is between the ages of 45 and 65.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36214000/"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;, less than two dozen cases of extremely early-onset (25 and younger) FTD have been documented worldwide. The earliest known case of FTD occurred at age 14, but Yarham seems to have been the youngest case recorded in England, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/britains-youngest-dementia-sufferer-dies-33179086"&gt;Manchester Evening News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Lessons to be learned&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia tends to be caused by a complex mix of factors, some of which may be preventable or modifiable through lifestyle changes. But early-onset dementia cases are strongly tied to genetic mutations, including some that make the disease all but inevitable. Yarham’s illness in particular was linked to a protein mutation, according to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though most cases aren’t early-onset, scientists could potentially learn important things about dementia, and FTD specifically, from better understanding the genetic factors underpinning Yarham’s case. Following his death, Fairbairn agreed to donate his brain to Addenbrooke’s Hospital for research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“If in the future that can help one family get a few more years with their loved ones then, that would be worth it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that over 55 million people globally are living with dementia, including &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2025/07-08/dementia-behavioral-interventions"&gt;around 7 million&lt;/a&gt; people in the U.S. These numbers are expected to more than double by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
