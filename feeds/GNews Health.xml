&lt;p&gt;Miliary tuberculosis (MTB) is a severe form of tuberculosis in which the instigating bacteria— &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; or potentially a relative that infects cows and deer, &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/em&gt;—spread widely through the body and create small lesions. The name “miliary” dates back to 1700, when a physician noted that the specks resembled millet seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt; can spread through the air and are often found in the lungs, the bacteria can strike anywhere in the body. Still, penile tuberculosis is exceedingly rare. In fact, it’s uncommon to have tuberculosis erupt anywhere in the urinary and genital tracts. Among the infections that spring up in the region, penile infections account for less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, given the man’s lungs and his immunosuppressed status, the unusual presentation became their leading guess—and tests soon confirmed it. &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium &lt;/em&gt;were identified in the man’s respiratory tract, and penile tissue tested also showed the bacteria, though the testing couldn’t identify what species of &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment for tuberculosis requires a regimen of several antibiotics and takes months. In the man’s case, they customized his treatment with a 12-month, four-drug regimen that wouldn’t interfere with his transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the penile lesion got worse before it got better. He developed a large necrotic ulceration on the side of his penis, and his foreskin began to “break down.” Surgeons had to mechanically cut out the dead tissue. After 10 months, his infection appeared to have cleared, and his penile lesion had improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unexplained exposure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the man got the infection. He told doctors he wasn’t aware of coming in contact with any tuberculosis patients and wasn’t in settings where the bacteria normally spread, such as prisons. It’s possible that the bacteria had been lurking in his transplanted kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

"We don't want to say the sky is falling, so to speak, but the whole industry is jumping on this ASAP." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Joe Stricklin, a veterinarian in Greeley, Colorado, told Cowboy State Daily that "a confirmed case (of EHM) showing early neurological signs" has been confirmed in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;That horse was exposed to the virus in Waco and later attended events in Casper and Wheatland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;That means many Wyoming horses have, in all likelihood, already been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Stay Home'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"We're just at the tip of finding out how far and wide this virus has spread," Stricklin said. "It takes anywhere from four to 14 days for horses to start showing symptoms, so we're in that period where (infected horses) are just starting to show symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Nemetz said he's "not any way, shape, form or fashion an expert in veterinary medicine," but he urges Western horse owners to take an abundance of caution and monitor their horses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"Let's stay vigilant," he said. "We want to create awareness that these viruses are out there, and if you see any signs and symptoms in your horse, it might be worth a call to your veterinarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin has a simple but urgent message to horse owners nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"Stay home," he said. "I'm not going to tell anyone to quit living, but this isn't a common, everyday rhinovirus. It's a variant that has some deadly potential to it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Horses can appear perfectly healthy yet spread EHV-1. (USDA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread, Symptoms, And Severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Stricklin, EHV-1 and its variants are notoriously easy to spread. It doesn't take much for the virus to be transmitted from horse to horse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"The most common method of transmission is going to be horse to horse, nose to nose," he said. "But it can also spread if one horse is shedding, if they're tied beside each other, rode in the same trailer, or drank out of the same bucket." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Humans can also spread EHV-1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The virus isn't zoonotic, so it can't infect humans, but humans can unknowingly carry and spread it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"If a horse sheds the virus onto someone's clothes, and that person goes to another horse, the virus can be transmitted to that horse," he said. "It's just like a cough or cold. Viral moisture particles can spread the virus from one horse to the next." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial symptoms of EHV-1 include nasal discharge and a fever above 101.5 degrees. Symptoms that EHV-1 has progressed into EHM include weakness and stumbling in the hind limbs, difficulty urinating or defecating, "dead tail," and dribbling urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It progresses to the point where horses can get down and can't get up," Stricklin said. "In some cases where this variant has surfaced, horses have died within 24 hours of showing the neurological symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin described the current outbreak as "moderately serious," but he expects an increase in cases in several states over the next 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;He is already monitoring five horses in Colorado that "are either running high temps or starting with discharge from noses" after confirmed exposure to the infected horse from Waco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"The next 10 days are going to give us a huge outlook into what we can expect for the next month," he said. "If people can take it easy for the next week, we'll know if it's blowing up exponentially or we're getting it under control." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wyoming Exposed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wyo Blu Equine Vet Clinic in Wheatland reports that horses that attended barrel races at Riata Ranch in Cheyenne on Nov. 15 and J Bar C in Wheatland on Nov. 16 were exposed to at least one of the confirmed cases of EHV-1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horses of concern also attended a rodeo in Casper around the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin confirmed that Colorado's first confirmed case of EHM attended events in Casper and Wheatland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;It was infected at the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals in Waco, but attended the Wyoming events before showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"That horse started showing neurological symptoms on Thursday night," he said. "They were mild at that time, but I haven't spoken to the people treating that horse since then." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horses exposed in Casper, Cheyenne, and Wheatland might not be showing any symptoms yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Concerned horse owners should begin looking for the initial symptoms, nasal discharge and fever, taking their horse's temperature twice a day, and contacting their local veterinarian immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nemetz said EHV-1 isn't necessarily fatal, provided it's caught and treated as soon as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Most of these horses recover, if they receive veterinary care promptly and EHV-1 doesn't progress into EHM," he said. "It does require some strict monitoring and isolation, but as long as you can keep it EHV-1 from progressing, a lot of these horses recover and live." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/understanding-the-recent-equine-herpesvirus-ehv-outbreak/" title="https://cvm.missouri.edu/understanding-the-recent-equine-herpesvirus-ehv-outbreak/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; recommends that any horse that attended the Waco event or any venue with known EHV-1/EHM cases should enter strict quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Trailers and equipment should be disinfected, and horses shouldn't be released from quarantine until 14 days after their last known exposure and a negative test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a vaccine for EHV-1, but exposed or infected horses shouldn't be vaccinated. Non-exposed horses should receive an EHV-1 booster if they have not been vaccinated within three months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It's not a death sentence if it's detected and treated early enough," Nemetz said. "The trick is not to let it go, or think that it's going to get better on its own. Pick up the phone, text your veterinarian, and get them out to check on that animal right away." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stricklin said the last major outbreak of EHV-1 happened in Ogden, Utah, in 2011. It spread to at least eight states and killed several horses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It's something that people need to take seriously," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Home &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;EHV-1 outbreaks are serious, especially at large events like the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The key to avoiding exposures and getting the outbreak under control is to avoid or use extreme discretion when attending rodeos, horse sales, and other events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The Billings Livestock Commission already canceled its Nov. 22 livestock sale "due to concerns" about the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin encouraged horse owners to consider avoiding these events until the extent of the outbreak is better understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"A lot of times, these horses that have been traveling a lot," he said. "After going hard all summer or all year, their immune systems get weak, so it doesn't take a lot for these horses to become infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Another reason to stay home is the Marshall and Sterling Insurance/USHJA National Championships, held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Nov. 10-16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Horses that were exposed to EHV-1 in Waco might have gone directly to Las Vegas, making it a potential super-spreading event for EHV-1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"I have a great concern for the events that went on in Vegas," Stricklin said. "All the horses at these events have gone in so many different directions, and we're just seeing the first round of the horses getting sick from Waco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"In another week, we're going to start seeing horses from who knows where starting to show symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Nemetz encouraged Wyoming horse owners to exercise caution, even if it means missing a rodeo or horse show in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many upcoming events may be cancelled out of caution, but it's not worth risking your horses' health or the spread of EHV-1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"If more positive cases surface, everyone will take a step back," he said. "I'm sure these events and sales will pick back up once we know where we stand, but this is the right time to make sure the virus doesn't continue to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Rossi can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:arossi@cowboystatedaily.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;arossi@cowboystatedaily.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPeVpSZENaUG15S29NMDRCMUt4QXF3cWNFUE5SWHdQdUZPbVBpdWR6ei01a2UxLW02aGlEelRWcDJmWEoxT3I3bVpQOHlxZnNZaG1OdFY5VVY0b2NhZjNXemIxb3lrLWF3LW55cGtpN2I2N205cTBiVXN1Z0hXV2RrMzdaYTFsSDJPczM3Nmh2YkxDaDNXeEY1UUprRzN1T0d4b0ZpajJMcmZtUFdR</guid></item><item><title>福克斯新闻健康通讯：普通香料可以促进幸福和性健康-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/health/fox-news-health-newsletter-common-spice-could-boost-happiness-sexual-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Based on information available to date, the individual is not employed by the GSP Airport District. While we do not have additional details about the individual’s role or movements, we encourage anyone who believes they may have been exposed on November 10 or 11, to review the Department of Public Health’s guidance and follow their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;“For some context, GSP Airport District employees around 250 employees. But the airport support over 2,000 jobs. There are a wide range of employers including airlines, rental cars, janitorial service, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;An individual was also confirmed to have attended the Way of Truth Church in Inman while infectious, DPH said. Anyone who attended on Friday, Nov. 7 from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. and the morning of Sunday, Nov. 9 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;People who were exposed, especially those without immunity through vaccination or previous disease, should monitor for symptoms through Nov. 30 if at the church or Dec. 2 if at the airport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The DPH said the total number of cases in the Upstate outbreak is 52 and the total reported to DPH this year in the state is 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Feel more informed, prepared, and connected with FOX Carolina.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yinging Ma, lead study author and doctoral student at The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'By just two months of age, we can already see patterns in feeding, sleep and play that may shape a child's growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This shows how important it is to screen early in infancy so we can support families to build healthy routines, prevent excessive weight gain and help every child get off to the best possible start.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this year in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837959"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 143 mothers and their babies who were receiving care from Geiser Health System in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-557abf40-c6ea-11f0-9690-cb2f8ffbf0b4"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and were enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides food assistance for women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mothers completed a 15-question survey about their infant's diet, sleep, playtime and appetite, as well as if caregivers fed their babies with breastmilk, formula or a combination of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the mothers was 26, and 70 percent were white. The majority (58 percent) of households made under $25,000 per year, which is below the poverty line for a three-person household in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At two months old, 73 percent of infants were exclusively formula-fed. Infant growth was measured once at two months and again at six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that out of 12 behavioral routines, nine that were done when infants were two months old were associated with higher BMI and weight-to-length ratios when the babies turned six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of feeding, these routines included using bottle sizes that were too big for the infant's developmental stage, feeding too often at night and mothers thinking their infants were hungry more often than they actually were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the sleeping category, the four routines that led to higher weight were going to bed after 8pm, waking up more than twice at night, being put to bed while already asleep instead of drowsy and sleeping in a room with a TV playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for playtime, babies with higher BMIs were more likely to have parents who used their phone or watched TV during playtime and those who had limited active play or tummy time, when an infant spends time on their stomach to strengthen their upper body muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overfeeding infants, along with sedentary habits and a lack of physical activity, causes them to pack on weight. Poor sleep has been shown to increase levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear if the infants in the study remained overweight later in life, research shows early infancy is a key window that determines obesity risk. The first six months of an infant's life determine metabolism, or how well the body is able to turn food into energy. Slower metabolism burns fewer calories, causing them to be stored as excess fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slow metabolism early in life can cause infants to have bigger appetites as they grow up and more fat mass, leading to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Affecting three in four Americans, overweight or obesity are primary risk factors for developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team hopes to expand their research and look at families with a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds, as the new study largely focused on low-income households.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennifer Savage Williams, senior study author and professor and director of The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'With the limited time available during pediatric and nutrition visits, it's essential to help providers focus on what matters most for each family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy isn’t something we usually associate with specific geographic regions, but new research suggests that’s an oversight—at least in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research finds that certain parts of the U.S. have much higher rates of epilepsy than others. Researchers examined the Medicare data of Americans over 65 from across the country. Older adults were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a new case of epilepsy if they lived in the southeastern U.S., they found. The findings suggest that this region might have unique risk factors that contribute to the neurological condition, such as hotter weather or larger health care disparities, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Modifiable social and environmental conditions at the local level may contribute to epilepsy incidence among older adults and could help guide targeted prevention efforts,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2841156"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The epilepsy belt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/epilepsy-and-seizures"&gt;disorder&lt;/a&gt; characterized by surges of unusual electrical activity in the brain, which then causes recurring seizures. There are many different causes and forms of epilepsy, but it’s known that certain groups of people are more likely to develop it, including older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that the prevalence of diagnosed epilepsy can differ between various regions of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00302-5/fulltext"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214035"&gt;the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., the scientists behind the new study say theirs is the first to map how often epilepsy affects older Americans at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are from the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. They analyzed Medicare claims data from 2016 to 2019, focusing on epilepsy cases newly diagnosed in 2019. All told, there were about 20,000 cases diagnosed that year. And the incidence rate of epilepsy varied significantly between regions of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest rates were found in southeastern states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The researchers also identified various factors that seemed to be correlated with epilepsy in the states along this “epilepsy belt”—as the researchers have dubbed it. Rates of insufficient sleep were higher in Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, for instance; southern states also had more days of extreme heat during the year (a heat index above 95 degrees); and states like Texas and Florida had higher uninsurance rates (younger people without insurance are less likely to see a doctor, which could then delay a timely diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some of these factors are thought to clearly increase epilepsy risk, like poor sleep, others have received less attention as potential causes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is the first study documenting such a strong association between extreme heat and incident epilepsy in older adults across the U.S., highlighting the importance of climate change in emergency preparedness, especially given the graying of the population,” said study researcher Siran Koroukian, professor in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/discovering-america-s-epilepsy-belt-first-of-its-kind-national-study-reveals-us-regions-with-high/"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notably, this same region of the U.S. is also known to have higher rates of stroke, which has led researchers to call it the “&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.024155"&gt;stroke belt&lt;/a&gt;“. Since strokes are yet another major risk factor of epilepsy, that too is likely playing a part in causing new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Areas of improvement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that about 3 million American adults are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;living with epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. And while the condition isn’t currently curable in most cases, it can be effectively treated with medications, surgery, and managing potential triggers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their findings can help improve efforts on epilepsy prevention and mitigation through various public health interventions in the areas of the country where people’s risk is highest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These may include improving sleep health, enhancing heat resilience, and reducing transportation and insurance-related barriers to care,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;(Des Moines) -- State health officials have confirmed the first flu death this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iowa Health and Human Services announced Friday an older individual from southwest Iowa is the first influenza-related death of 2025-26 respiratory season. Iowa's most recent Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report shows the virus at a very low level of activity, and hospitals are currently reporting low patient admission rates. Although flu activity in Iowa is currently low, officials say Iowans can take precautions to keep themselves and their families healthy throughout the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three studies published in one of the most respected medical journals paint a vivid picture of how ultra-processed foods are wreaking havoc on global health. Their packaging is bright, their claims are bold, but strip away the marketing, and what remains is not exactly food. It’s more like an industrial formulation that mimics food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/ultraprocessed-foods-account-for-more-than-half-of-calories-consumed-at-home"&gt;account for over half of adult calories&lt;/a&gt;, and over 60% of children’s calories. Many other countries &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8398521/"&gt;have comparable figures&lt;/a&gt;, so UPFs are on the rise almost everywhere. And according to the world’s largest scientific review on the subject, these products are now linked to harm in every major organ system of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-just-burgers-and-sodas"&gt;Not Just Burgers and Sodas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no simple, straightforward definition of ultra-processed foods, even though they’re so widespread. They’re foods that usually have a lot of ingredients and are prepared through methods that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6389637/"&gt;we couldn’t do ourselves at home&lt;/a&gt;. They’re often very rich in salt and sugar, as well as plenty of additives. They also typically have unnatural textures and are ready to eat or just need heating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists use something called the “Nova” system to classify UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Nova group 1 you have basic things like apples, uncooked rice, or fish. These are &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/most-ultra-processed-food-is-bad-but-there-are-some-big-exceptions/"&gt;unprocessed or minimally processed&lt;/a&gt;. On the other end, you have Nova group 4: &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/8-everyday-foods-you-might-not-realise-are-ultra-processed-and-how-to-spot-them/"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. These are the sodas, the packaged snacks, the reconstituted meat nuggets, and the breakfast cereals that never go stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;Carlos Monteiro&lt;/a&gt;, Brazilian epidemiologist who coined the term ultra-processed food and introduced the Nova classification, argues in the new study that UPFs have &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/eating-more-ultra-processed-foods-tied-to-increased-risk-of-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;fundamentally different chemical structures&lt;/a&gt; than “regular” food. He and his colleagues focus on something called the food matrix.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you eat something like a fruit or a whole almond, your body has to work to break down the cell walls to access the fats and nutrients. This is the “food matrix.” It slows digestion and sends satiety signals to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs destroy that matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing process breaks down raw ingredients into molecular slurry, then reconstructs them using emulsifiers, texturizers, and artificial flavors. The result is something referred to as “hyper-palatable.” It melts in your mouth so fast your brain never gets the signal to stop eating. That’s a big reason why UPFs are so bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The consequences are visible in the data: over 100 prospective studies link these foods to adverse outcomes in nearly all organ systems, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="upfs-took-over-the-world"&gt;UPFs Took Over the World&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How did we reach a point where 50% of the average diet consists of these industrial products?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to blame consumers. These foods are tastier, more palatable (by definition), and oftentimes, cheaper. Oftentimes, we know they’re &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/ultra-processed-foods-made-healthy-young-men-gain-fat-and-lose-sperm-quality-in-just-three-weeks/"&gt;not as healthy&lt;/a&gt; and we still buy them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-ultra-processed-food-blame-business-not-consumers"&gt;deeply unfair&lt;/a&gt; to put consumers at the center of the problem. It wasn’t an accident. It was a business model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third paper in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; series drops a bombshell, comparing the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/tobacco-company-smuggling-03092018/"&gt;food industry’s tactics&lt;/a&gt; directly to the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/nutrition-medicine/tobacco-companies-were-big-in-promoting-junk-food-in-america/"&gt;tobacco industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;UPFs are significantly more profitable than fresh food. They have a long shelf life and use cheap ingredients like soy protein isolate and high-fructose corn syrup. To protect these profits, the industry has deployed a “corporate political activity” playbook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rough idea is that they lobby governments to block any regulation that would push for healthier food (and people) at the expense of their product. They fund research to manufacture doubt about the science. They infiltrate health agencies. The authors note that the industry has created a “global network of front groups” to ensure that policy debates focus on individual choice rather than corporate culpability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-how-do-we-reclaim-our-plates"&gt;So, How Do We Reclaim Our Plates?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second paper in the series outlines a policy roadmap, and the message is clear: we need to treat UPF like the public health crisis it is. Otherwise, obesity will continue to worsen, along with all the other problems associated with unhealthy diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re in the same position with food that we were with cigarettes in the 1960s. The evidence is mounting, but the regulation is lagging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors call for aggressive moves. We need to ban the marketing of UPFs to children. We need to remove these products from schools and hospitals. And we need clear warning labels — not just about calories, but about the level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that sounds really hard, well, it is. But it’s not impossible. Look at Brazil, for instance. Their national school food program has eliminated most UPFs. By 2026, they will require 90% of the food served in schools to be fresh or minimally processed. They proved that government policy can prioritize health over corporate profit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we wait for policy to catch up, you have to be your own defense system. Some simple things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore the front of the package.&lt;/strong&gt; The health claims are marketing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;. If you see ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen — emulsifiers, protein isolates, high-fructose corn syrup — it’s likely ultra-processed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the matrix.&lt;/strong&gt; Eat foods that look like they grew out of the ground, not foods that were born in a factory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Current treatments cannot cure the condition. Although antibody-based drugs targeting amyloid β (Aβ) have recently become available, their benefits remain modest. These therapies can also be expensive and may trigger immune-related side effects, underscoring the need for safer, low-cost options that are easier for patients to access.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt; reports that researchers from Kindai University and partner institutions found that oral arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a safe chemical chaperone, can markedly reduce Aβ aggregation and its toxic effects in animal models of AD. The team noted that although arginine is sold as a dietary supplement, the dose and schedule used in their experiments were designed for research and do not match commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was led by Graduate Student Kanako Fujii and Professor Yoshitaka Nagai from the Department of Neurology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, along with Associate Professor Toshihide Takeuchi from the Life Science Research Institute, Kindai University, Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory and Animal Tests Show Strong Anti-Amyloid Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that arginine slows the formation of Aβ42 aggregates in a concentration-dependent fashion. Building on this evidence, the researchers tested oral arginine in two widely used AD models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; model, expressing Aβ42 with the Arctic mutation (E22G)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An &lt;em&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;knock-in mouse model, carrying three familial AD mutations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both systems, arginine treatment led to a significant drop in Aβ buildup and reduced the harmful effects associated with Aβ exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress Aβ aggregation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;," explains Prof. Nagai. "What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits Extend Beyond Amyloid Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mouse model, oral arginine lowered amyloid plaque formation and reduced insoluble Aβ42 levels in the brain. Mice receiving arginine also performed better in behavioral assessments and showed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes linked to neuroinflammation, a key contributor to AD progression. These results indicate that arginine's benefits may involve not only preventing aggregation but also providing broader neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," notes Prof. Nagai. "Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to clinical trials for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repurposing Existing Compounds for Alzheimer's Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the advantages of drug repositioning, a strategy that repurposes existing safe compounds for new therapeutic uses. Because arginine is already approved for clinical use in Japan and shows good brain permeability, it may bypass multiple early hurdles that often slow traditional drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that additional preclinical and clinical studies are essential to confirm whether these effects will translate to humans and to determine appropriate dosing strategies. Even so, the results present strong proof of concept that basic nutritional or pharmacological supplementation could reduce amyloid pathology and improve neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cost-Effective Approach With Global Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study deepens scientific understanding of how Aβ aggregation occurs and presents a practical approach that could be implemented at scale. Its findings point to a cost-effective, readily available strategy that may one day support people affected by AD across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common health problems of old age -- dehydration, delirium, malnutrition or falls -- can become catastrophic if they occur following a major surgery, a new study reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who suffer these issues while recovering from surgery are more likely to die within a year, and will require more time in hospitals or nursing facilities, researchers reported Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/journalacs/abstract/9900/new_onset_geriatric_syndromes_among_patients.1441.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American College of Surgeons&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A geriatric syndrome can be a 'canary in the coal mine,' signaling a patient's underlying vulnerability," senior researcher &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/timothy-m-pawlik" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Timothy Pawlik&lt;/a&gt;, a surgical oncologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's crucial we don't dismiss these events as just a normal part of 'getting older.' These are important warning signs that a patient needs closer monitoring and tailored support, both in the hospital and after discharge," Pawlik said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed Medicare claims data for more than 780,000 patients older than 66 who underwent one of five major operations between 2016 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operations included coronary artery bypass, lung removal, repair of an artery aneurysm in the abdomen, removal of the pancreas or removal of part of the colon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 11% of patients developed at least one new geriatric syndrome during their hospitalization -- delirium, dehydration, malnutrition, falls or loss of bladder or bowel control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydration was the most common problem, affecting 67% of patients, followed by delirium (25%) and malnutrition (13%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who developed one of these health problems of old age were far less likely to be discharged directly home. They spent a median of 16 fewer days at home in the three months following surgery -- 27% less than those who didn't develop a geriatric syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who developed any one of the problems also had a doubled risk of death within one year. That death risk more than tripled if a person developed two or more geriatric syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were older and had other existing health problems were more likely to develop a post-surgical geriatric syndrome, researchers found. The risk also was higher if they needed emergency surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, minimally invasive procedures were associated with a 49% lower risk of developing a geriatric syndrome, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings show that it's important to approach surgery for older people differently, researchers said, by taking into account their medical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By focusing on the unique needs of older patients, we can better anticipate, prevent, and manage these syndromes, which directly translates to helping patients get back home and back to their lives," Pawlik said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chopping and lightly stir-frying your broccoli may increase the amount of a specific antioxidant, called sulforaphane, thereby maximizing the health benefits you get from the vegetable, research suggests.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The paper, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, raises the question of whether there are “right” and “wrong” ways to cook broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that cooking inhibits another enzyme called myrosinase, which is essential for sulforaphane production. Therefore, longer, harsher cooking methods result in a greater reduction in sulforaphane levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It is widely known that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/raw-vs-cooked-vegetables-11812062" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prolonged cooking can degrade nutrients&lt;/a&gt; in broccoli, including sulforaphane,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephani-johnson-rdn-dcn-88856120/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Stephani Johnson, RDN, DCN&lt;/a&gt;, adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition services at the Rutgers School of Health Professions, told Verywell.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that lightly stir-frying broccoli actually helped decrease the activity of myrosinase during the cooking process, which translates to higher levels of sulforaphane on your plate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, researchers found that chopping broccoli into florets about 90 minutes before lightly stir-frying it was associated with the highest levels of sulforaphane.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This is likely because chopping activates myrosinase, facilitating the conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane before the enzyme is deactivated by heat,” Johnson said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study is limited in that the authors didn’t look at how other forms of preparation—such as microwaving or steaming—affect the sulforaphane levels in broccoli.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If raw broccoli sounds good to you, that’s a perfectly good reason to eat it, Johnson said. “Ultimately, eating broccoli in any form is better than not eating it at all, but raw or lightly cooked preparations are generally the best options for maximizing its health-promoting properties.”

While mitigation measures such as hunting may help slow its spread, it can't be stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because cervids are ubiquitous and free ranging, the interval from infection to symptom onset can take years, and prions spread easily from animal to animal and through environmental contamination, which can persist for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnston's daughter, Kristal Enter, 39, a fundraiser in Boston, is familiar with CWD and its potential implications for human health. "Seeing what my mom went through, I do not want anyone else to have to experience that, nor their family members," she told CIDRAP News. "The more we're on top of chronic wasting disease and thinking about it, the better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the frightening thing is that, for well over a month during the recent US government shutdown, no one was watching the human disease landscape for CWD, a highly infectious disease with no treatment or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;If cases slip by, it will be too late&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nine days after the government shutdown began, all four staff members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Prion and Public Health Office were sent home after receiving reduction-in-force (RIF) notices. While the end of the shutdown led all four to be reinstated through at least January, layoffs after that time are possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the past few months, two other researchers who had been part of the team also had to be let go after their fellowship contracts weren't renewed, per the administration's policy of blocking contract renewals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prion unit, which monitors the nation for human prion diseases, is part of the Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. It launched in the mid-1990s in response to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease") in UK cattle. BSE prions were inadvertently consumed by people who ate contaminated beef, causing the human form of BSE, variant CJD (vCJD). All infected people—more than 230—died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The initial goal of the Prion and Public Health Office was to watch for any cases of vCJD in the US population. Since then, its focus has expanded to include advising hospitals on how to prevent and respond to prion contamination of instruments used in neurosurgery (prions are resistant to many usual sterilization methods), as well as working with state health departments on disease surveillance. Unit members also answer questions from the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, as CWD continues its inexorable march across the landscape, exposing more and more people, the prion unit's priority is conducting surveillance for signs of a CWD species jump into high-risk people such as hunters. Without this expertise, no one will be able to evaluate whether a suspected case of CWD prion transmission to humans is likely from an animal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prion unit has launched several epidemiologic studies in collaboration with multiple states to look at whether more hunters are dying of prion diseases than would be expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an example of the unit's work, last spring, a cluster of CJD cases in Oregon was widely conjectured to be linked to CWD. Such cases require autopsy and an epidemiologic investigation to determine whether CWD was involved and, if so, what kind of public health measures are needed. The prion unit shared ideas and strategy with the Oregon state health department in this investigation, which, thankfully, found no link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts say that without anyone looking for these deviations from normal—particularly given that signs of illness may take years to appear—cases could easily go unnoticed, and it will be too late to implement public health measures that could mitigate some of these consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lawrence Schonberger, MD, MPH, retired chief of the Prion and Public Health Office, said that, as was the situation with BSE, CWD containment efforts must continue. "Unlike with mad cow disease, however, these efforts to date have not been successful," he said. Surveillance and research "should continue to help people recognize any emerging risk to humans from this agent now and in the future, when this agent's pathogenicity [ability to cause disease] may change."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Worst time to get rid of such a division'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brian Appleby, MD, is director of the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western University, which conducts diagnostic testing for human prion diseases and conducted Johnston's autopsy. The CDC funds the center, which collaborates with the Prion and Public Health Office on public health efforts and research projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To vape or not to vape?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's Tobacco Control Treaty and what they call "the tobacco epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597890/new-study-offers-first-evidence-of-vapings-long-term-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kill up to half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mea culpa!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. "I'm excommunicated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. "There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit," he says, arguing that this approach doesn't "recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In many other areas of medicine, the idea of "harm reduction" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: "Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach eventually founded the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's an important point to note about this group. It's funded by the tobacco industry. That connection has cemented his self-described excommunication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Yach is not a lone voice. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The U.K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that "for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not," Cummings says. "Many of us are legitimate scientists."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. "That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mass marketing harmful products"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the tobacco industry is "misappropriating" the medical term harm reduction and "mass marketing harmful products" while "cloaking" it in medical language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit," says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults," says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. "The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/5/e2025072337/204538/E-Cigarettes-and-the-Nicotine-Epidemic-Statement?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;/a&gt;"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone." The stakes, their position paper says, are high: "E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stella.bialous" target="_blank"&gt;Stella Bialous&lt;/a&gt;, the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One concern that's surfaced has been &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/07/16/disposable-e-cigarettes-study" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exposure to metals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254430/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have pointed in both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38411454/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's "not responsible" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"An unutterable scam"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is "actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'"&lt;/p&gt;

He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam," he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 15:05:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOejVvTGhKYVdYcVNxS0Y3QWJZM0M1VnJDYU5DNkMzZDBRN19CVGdRMmpNRjRPVDYzRzkxbEdKUTh0YVduOXlCemNTQzd5MHVUVHRjM25kSEdMdWQxUWFGellBUTFOSDR3ZEd6VjYxRnpvX0VaYUVOSFI4V1JuLVVqTWFfRzM0U2Z0N09xSFV4Y1dPRVBaVmZscHh3OWVwNFJTLXhhT1BNZw</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将耳鸣与您每天在不知不觉中使用的主要身体功能联系起来-印度国防评论</title><link>https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-just-linked-tinnitus-to-a-major-body-function-you-use-daily-without-realizing-it/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistent hum, hiss, or ring of &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus&lt;/strong&gt;—often described as a phantom sound—is not just a sensory glitch. For more than &lt;strong&gt;250 million people globally&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s an unrelenting companion that reshapes daily life. From mild irritation to full-blown sleep disruption and anxiety, the condition is often treated as untouchable: poorly understood, difficult to diagnose, and impossible to cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that assumption is beginning to shift. New research from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; has unearthed a surprising connection between tinnitus and one of the body’s most fundamental systems: &lt;strong&gt;sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, the patterns of neural activity that drive deep sleep may also act as a natural suppressor of tinnitus-related brain signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the center of this research is a radical reframe of tinnitus—not as a static condition of the ear, but as a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic brain state&lt;/strong&gt; that shifts depending on the body’s internal rhythms. That premise could open the door to a new class of therapies rooted not in external interventions, but in the body’s own architecture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sleep, the Brain’s Quiet Regulator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;, focus on &lt;strong&gt;non-REM (NREM) sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, the phase characterized by &lt;strong&gt;slow-wave brain activity&lt;/strong&gt; critical for cognitive recovery. These deep-sleep rhythms appear to directly counteract the &lt;strong&gt;hyperactive neuronal firing&lt;/strong&gt; linked to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; and a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;animal study&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;em&gt;Linus Milinski&lt;/em&gt; of Oxford’s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, researchers observed &lt;strong&gt;ferrets&lt;/strong&gt; after exposure to loud noise. Those that developed tinnitus also showed &lt;strong&gt;disrupted sleep patterns&lt;/strong&gt; and signs of &lt;strong&gt;overactive brain responses&lt;/strong&gt; to sound stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We could actually see these sleep problems appear at the same time as tinnitus after noise exposure,” Milinski said. “This suggested, for the first time, a clear link between developing tinnitus and disrupted sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

More detail on brain regions involved is shown in Figure 1 of the paper. Credit: Milinski et al., Brain Comms., 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During episodes of &lt;strong&gt;deep NREM sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, the abnormal hyperactivity in the auditory cortex was significantly dampened. When the animals remained awake or slept lightly, the tinnitus-related signals persisted—indicating that &lt;strong&gt;sleep may suppress or modulate tinnitus activity&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another study from South China University of Technology, cited by Milinski in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;, found similar patterns in human participants. Researchers noted that individuals with tinnitus were &lt;strong&gt;less able to suppress brain hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt; as they transitioned into sleep. During deep sleep, however, the abnormal activity was markedly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Neurological Loop With No off Switch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings go far beyond the lab. Clinical evidence supports a pattern that tinnitus and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/he-vanished-into-a-cave-for-63-days-and-came-out-with-a-groundbreaking-discovery-that-redefined-science/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78236" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; frequently &lt;strong&gt;co-occur&lt;/strong&gt;—and may &lt;strong&gt;reinforce each other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study published in the &lt;em&gt;International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology&lt;/em&gt; examined patients with chronic tinnitus and found that over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;72% rated their sleep quality as poor&lt;/a&gt;. More than a quarter experienced &lt;strong&gt;moderate insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;, and a significant correlation was found between &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus severity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another independent study in &lt;em&gt;Medicine (Baltimore)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000040303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; similar findings: patients with more severe tinnitus experienced &lt;strong&gt;greater insomnia symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, although no strong link was found to daytime sleepiness or risk of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep.jpeg" alt="Topographic Overlap Of Brain Areas Involved In Tinnitus And Nrem Sleep" class="wp-image-96181" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep.jpeg 520w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep-380x159.jpeg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topographic overlap of brain areas involved in tinnitus and NREM sleep&lt;em&gt;. Credit: Milinski et al., Brain Comms., 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to Milinski, “Tinnitus can make sleep worse, and poor sleep may, in turn, make tinnitus worse. It may be a kind of vicious circle, although I do not believe it is unbreakable.” This quote is taken directly from &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/hearing-research/silencing-tinnitus/how-does-sleep-affect-tinnitus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNID’s research page&lt;/a&gt;, where Milinski outlines the research goals and early findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus may represent “local wakefulness” during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;—a state where certain brain regions remain active while others are shut down—has also been proposed in a &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Oxford’s Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics. This mismatched brain state may prevent restorative deep sleep and allow tinnitus-related activity to persist, even as most of the brain rests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reframing Tinnitus as a Brain Rhythm Disorder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, tinnitus has been viewed through a peripheral lens—as a consequence of &lt;strong&gt;ear damage&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;age-related hearing loss&lt;/strong&gt;. But the research now points to a more central problem: &lt;strong&gt;cortical hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in the &lt;strong&gt;auditory cortex&lt;/strong&gt;, driven by abnormal neural feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="What does tinnitus sound like? Ringing, crackling, buzzing examples" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgIrfiyK4x8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This aligns with a broader theory in neuroscience that &lt;strong&gt;phantom percepts&lt;/strong&gt; like tinnitus stem from &lt;strong&gt;dysregulated spontaneous activity&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain. In this framework, tinnitus is not just a reaction to silence but a &lt;strong&gt;maladaptive brain prediction&lt;/strong&gt;, continually generating sound in the absence of real stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oxford-led review in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; introduces a new model: by amplifying or supporting &lt;strong&gt;deep sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, it may be possible to &lt;strong&gt;interrupt this pathological loop&lt;/strong&gt; and rebalance the brain’s auditory pathways. The researchers propose that enhancing &lt;strong&gt;slow-wave activity&lt;/strong&gt;, either naturally or through non-invasive neurostimulation, could become a &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic pathway&lt;/strong&gt; for future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Timing and Intervention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If confirmed through large-scale studies, these insights could change how tinnitus is treated—and when. Milinski and his team believe that &lt;strong&gt;early intervention&lt;/strong&gt;—in the hours or days after tinnitus onset—could prevent it from becoming chronic, particularly if sleep is supported during this period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Widening the scope in tinnitus research towards the brain’s natural dynamics will provide fruitful ground for understanding those of pathological nature,” Milinski said in &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford’s official research statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research will aim to identify &lt;strong&gt;neurophysiological markers&lt;/strong&gt; of tinnitus during sleep and test methods to reinforce deep-sleep brain activity. The goal is not just to mask tinnitus, but to &lt;strong&gt;interrupt the brain’s faulty feedback loop&lt;/strong&gt; at its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a third of Americans who were vaccinated against COVID-19 say they had side effects from the shot, and nearly half suspect the vaccines killed many patients,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 68% of American Adults say they got a COVID-19 vaccination, and a majority (60%) of vaccinated adults report no side effects from the vaccine. However, 26% say they had minor side effects and 10% reported major side effects from the vaccine. Based on a U.S. adult population of 258 million, this would mean 63 million had at least some side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, including more than 17 million who experienced major side effects.

&lt;p&gt;Among all American Adults (including those who didn’t get vaccinated against COVID-19), 46% believe it is likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths – down from 55% in &lt;a href="/public_content/lifestyle/covid_19/killer_shot_most_still_suspect_covid_19_vaccine_risk" target="_self"&gt;September 2024 &lt;/a&gt;– including 25% who say it’s Very Likely. Forty-four percent (44%) now don’t think a significant number of deaths have been caused by vaccine side effects, including 20% who believe it’s Not At All Likely. Another 12% are not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,292 American Adults was conducted on November 10-12, 2024 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See&lt;a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/about_us/methodology" target="_blank"&gt; methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who didn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine are more likely to suspect it had deadly side effects. Seventy percent (70%) of those who weren’t vaccinated, compared to 36% of those who did get the shot, consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who were vaccinated, 85% of those who reported major side effects think it’s at least somewhat likely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths. By comparison, 69% of those who reported no side effects from the vaccine consider it unlikely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly more men (72%) than women (66%) got vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and more men (12%) than women (8%) report experiencing major side effects from the shot. However, more women (49%) than men (43%) consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older voters are most likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and less likely to say they experienced side effects. Twenty-two percent (22%) of men under 40 say they experienced major side effects from the vaccine, compared to just seven percent (7%) of women 40 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-two percent (42%) of whites, 46% of blacks, 53% of Hispanics and 63% of other minorities believe it is at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths. Hispanics are most likely to have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, and also most likely to report having experienced major side effects from the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven percent (57%) of Americans with annual incomes between $30,000-$50,000 say it’s likelythat COVID-19 vaccines caused many deaths, compared to just 36% of those with annual incomes over $200,000 who say the same.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;About one in ten perimenopausal or menopausal women masturbate to relieve their symptoms, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that has generated &lt;a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/diagnostics/news/women-rate-masturbation-highly-for-managing-menopause-symptoms-407027"&gt;media interest&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention is likely because masturbation is a novel (and possibly somewhat salacious) strategy to ease these symptoms, and older women are &lt;a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=_onDEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA123&amp;amp;dq=older+women+treated+as+asexual&amp;amp;ots=8G12H9r5JV&amp;amp;sig=Ud_eYMUr6sdfTbe10Z0dsIZclb4"&gt;often seen as asexual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does masturbating really relieve symptoms, as the study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Menopause&lt;/em&gt; suggests? Let's see if the evidence stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-isnt-as-responsible-for-lost-libido-as-we-always-thought"&gt;Menopause Isn't as Responsible For Lost Libido as We Always Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The health benefits of masturbation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in the United States and was led by researchers at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, one of the world's best known research institutes that specializes in sex and relationships. The study was funded by sex toy company Womanizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4135/9781412963909.n363"&gt;representative sample&lt;/a&gt; of 1,178 perimenopausal and menopausal women aged 40–65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who reported changes in their periods but still had at least one period in the previous year were categorized as perimenopausal. Women who said they had not have a period in a year or longer were categorized as menopausal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About four in five of the women said they had ever masturbated. Of those, about 20 percent said masturbating relieved their symptoms to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For perimenopausal women, the most improved symptoms were sleep difficulties and irritability. For a small number of menopausal women, it helped most with vaginal pain, bloating and painful urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are consistent with previous research showing masturbating to orgasm may help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2024.2344812"&gt;reduce anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and psychological distress, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00033"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; and reduce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681990601149197"&gt;vaginal pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research on the health, social or relationship benefits of masturbation, including for menopause relief, is sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we cannot be sure exactly how masturbating might improve symptoms. But researchers propose the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sxmrev/qeaf023"&gt;relaxation effects&lt;/a&gt; of orgasm, and the release of endorphins, can improve mood, help sleep and reduce pain. Sexual stimulation may also induce vaginal lubrication and blood flow to the genital area, which can help maintain vaginal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of women in the study said masturbating worsened their symptoms, although it was unclear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182606" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182606" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the anatomy of a clitoris ." class="wp-image-182606 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram.jpg 1284w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-642x618.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-701x675.jpg 701w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-768x739.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-600x578.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182606" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The internal anatomy of the clitoris, with the clitoral hood and labia minora indicated as lines.

But it still carries a level of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-010-9722-0"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, often associate masturbation with sexual shame and tend &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2017.09.009"&gt;not to talk&lt;/a&gt; openly about their masturbation habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2012.745474"&gt;stigma and invisibility&lt;/a&gt; of masturbation means it is rarely the subject of clinical research investigating its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we have very little evidence on its effectiveness to relieve menopause symptoms, especially compared to other non-medical interventions such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-024-03243-4"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2515690X19829380"&gt;stress relief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US study showed women were substantially more likely to manage menopause symptoms through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2025.2548806"&gt;evidence-based strategies&lt;/a&gt; of physical activity, diet or stress reduction, than with masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many women in the study might have never considered masturbation to relieve their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masturbation isn't for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masturbation is free, relatively easy and, for most women, &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-29/its-time-to-close-the-masturbation-gap/10182068"&gt;enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;. There is no reason why it should not be promoted as an accessible menopause relief strategy that may benefit some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not always so simple. There may be barriers for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02071-z"&gt;Not all women&lt;/a&gt; masturbate or enjoy masturbation. The US study showed nearly one in five women surveyed had never masturbated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This number was higher among older, menopausal women, perhaps reflecting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J056v14n02_04?urlappend=%3Futm_source%3Dresearchgate.net%26medium%3Darticle"&gt;generational change&lt;/a&gt; in attitudes about masturbation. Some women in the study indicated a moral or religious resistance to masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have similarly shown that a number of women &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-006-9123-6"&gt;do not masturbate&lt;/a&gt;. There may be many reasons for this, from lack of desire through to &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/happyplaytime-app-hopes-to-help-women-masturbate-but-overlooks-the-real-reason-that-we-dont-logistics.html"&gt;limited privacy&lt;/a&gt; or "alone time".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.09.037"&gt;Older women&lt;/a&gt; may experience complex physical barriers, including loss of libido or limited dexterity and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence and stigma around masturbation may also make it difficult for health professionals to discuss masturbation with women. This was evident in the US study, with almost all reporting they had never spoken to a doctor about masturbation for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many women were open to these conversations, however, with about 56 percent of perimenopausal women indicating they would masturbate more often to treat menopause symptoms if their doctor recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masturbation as a novel strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there can be no guarantee masturbation will relieve menopause symptoms for all women, suggesting women give it a go is unlikely to cause harm. It is the &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/news/give-yourself-a-hand-the-health-benefits-of-masturbation"&gt;safest sex available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't talk much about masturbation, especially among older women. But by demonstrating that most older women do masturbate and this may offer health benefits, this latest study is novel and valuable.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270146/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/19/australia-ultra-processed-foods-consumption-rate-upf-lancet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half the calories they consume each day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The term was coined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366466/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/ultraprocessed-foods-what-they-are-and-how-to-identify-them/E6D744D714B1FF09D5BCA3E74D53A185" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt; that sorts foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two. Includes canned legumes, bread and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group four: ultra-processed foods which are commercial products made from extracts of foods, often with added chemicals, flavours and other ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there can be health harms from an unbalanced diet of foods in any of the groups – for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/24/the-truth-about-salt-how-to-avoid-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-hidden-killers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;those containing too much salt&lt;/a&gt; – researchers say the problem with group four is that the processes used to make them and the industrial ingredients they contain mean they are not “real food” and are more likely to cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they can be hard to spot. A long ingredients list with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;names you don’t recognise (hello maltodextrin and soy lecithin) is a giveaway for ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re unsure, the &lt;a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt; app lets you search for products and see their category.

Stay social&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another key brain health rule is to avoid social isolation. “As social beings, the human brain thrives on interacting with others. … When this does not happen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychiatry.uchicago.edu/news/how-social-isolation-affects-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="our memory and cognition can decline over time" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691f813de4b04484952391ac" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://psychiatry.uchicago.edu/news/how-social-isolation-affects-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;&lt;span&gt;our memory and cognition can decline over time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” Tan said. “It is important to keep engaged and connected with others.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn’t mean you have to transform into a social butterfly if you’re an introvert, but rather find a meaningful social activity to you.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some fitness enthusiasts take creatine and magnesium after a workout to boost muscle gains.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creatine is a compound made from amino acids, and magnesium is a mineral that supports protein synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Along with training, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/creatine-11714895" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;creatine can increase muscle strength and mass&lt;/a&gt;, and magnesium may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/nutrition-and-supplements-for-muscle-recovery-8374467" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;help with recovery and exercise performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2020 study of 16 trained soccer players found that a creatine–magnesium chelate improved sprint speed and power.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Another study from 2019 found that taking creatine with electrolytes, including magnesium, helps increase strength and power during certain exercises. You don’t need to take them together, though &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-are-electrolytes-11764438" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;electrolytes like magnesium&lt;/a&gt; may help the body use creatine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We know that creatine provides energy to the muscles during high-intensity exercise, and magnesium serves as a cofactor for energy utilization processes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you decide to take a combination creatine and magnesium supplement, consider taking it in the morning or with your workout.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The deeper and better you sleep, the more muscle mass and muscle recovery happens. In combination, creatine can help almost during the lift, when the muscles are ready to be in the hypertrophy phase, when they are ready to grow, and magnesium comes in at night to facilitate the recovery piece," Mergy said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people take a large loading dose of creatine to saturate their muscle stores before taking smaller daily doses.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Magnesium varies a bit by age and gender, but 350 milligrams would be the upper limit," &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/orthopedics/sports-medicine/team/sports-dietitians/sarah-wick-rd-cssd-ld" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sarah Wick, RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, director of sports nutrition at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Jameson Crane Sports Medicine Institute, told Verywell in an email.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You could try to get creatine and magnesium from food sources first, but if you want to take supplements, remember that higher doses are not always better. Speak with a healthcare provider before starting any supplements since your age, diet, training type, training intensity, medications, and health status might change dosage recommendations.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many people can take these without significant risks, don't expect overnight results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Both magnesium and creatine can take weeks to have beneficial effects because the body must reach certain levels, which takes time, to have an increased effect on health and physical activity," &lt;a href="https://mann.usc.edu/faculty/kari-l-franson-pharmd-phd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kari Franson, PharmD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, professor of clinical pharmacy and director of the sports pharmacy program at USC Mann, told Verywell in an email.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may experience uncomfortable gastrointestinal side effects when taking creatine and magnesium, such as nausea and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-do-if-creatine-makes-you-bloated-11812779" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. continues to face its &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worst&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fifth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/MEAS-AER-2024-Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;23 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Schwalbe calls those figures a "wake-up call."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;takes a toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v17060755" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to come in waves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Amid a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing trend&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An authoritarian past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization," says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. "It's multifactorial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/12/24/369593135/25-years-after-death-a-dictator-still-casts-a-shadow-in-romania" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ruled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Immunizations were &lt;a href="https://romania.europalibera.org/a/doctor-mihai-craiu-fake-news-medicina-vaccinare-stiinta-dezinformare/33569279.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;given&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. "Virtually all children were immunized," he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority," historian Dora Vargha &lt;a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.7765/9781526110916.00010/html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a book about vaccines. "If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;introduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the magic number for measles. "If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/1999/11/05/1066228/the-collapse-of-communism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adopted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians &lt;a href="https://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/articles/symposium2010/participant-papers/Simona_Vasilache_-_Romania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules," Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children," &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;read&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12013266" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008 campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cause&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as &lt;a href="https://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/view/195/191" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;headlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily, &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/wuenic-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-rezultatelor-estimarii-acoperirii-vaccinale-cu-2-doze-rro-la-5-ani-si-cu-1-doza-dtpa-la-14-ani_februarie-2024/?wpdmdl=127363&amp;amp;refresh=68f9bc5de5a3c1761197149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the share of those protected against measles decreased, &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=ROU&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pummeled the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't," says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. "Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A health system struggles to keep up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/21/romanias-health-care-system-the-eus-worst-struggles-to-reform" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fragile health system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that remains one of the most &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Healthcare_expenditure_statistics_-_overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;underfunded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, a &lt;a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-025-00985-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shrinking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11598722/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;absence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of mandatory immunization policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lack of funding for health care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-08-2025-new-study-exposes-barriers-to-childhood-vaccination-in-romanian-communities" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disproportionately affects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; minority groups like the country's &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/roma-eu/roma-equality-inclusion-and-participation-eu-country/romania_en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines," says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the years passed, the clergy &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccines-carry-tiny-knives-cut-veins-inside-romanias-toxic-anti/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-20133-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/romania-president-election-simion-trump.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advocating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2022.2080669" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; church services during the early years of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, far-right politicians &lt;a href="https://cepa.org/article/romanias-elections-a-victory-for-medical-populism/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;capitalized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, "God is not vaccinated" during a &lt;a href="https://spotmedia.ro/en/news/politics/romanian-mep-sosoaca-anti-vaccine-circus-in-the-european-parliament-until-her-microphone-was-cut-off-god-is-not-vaccinated-in-romania-88-are-not-vaccinated" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brief speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the floor of the European Parliament last year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A free fall in immunization coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-vaccination-coverage?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;ANTIGEN=MCV2&amp;amp;YEAR=&amp;amp;CODE=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lowest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.1787" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=170&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;administered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first at 12 months and then again at age 5.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small," the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. "Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recorded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf167" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mirrored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: "I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life," Schwalbe explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A different way to talk to parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. "It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now," Craiu explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When speaking with parents, Dumitra &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s500640" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uses motivational interviewing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065483" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'" Dumitra recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. "After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons from Romania's outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lost&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission, &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1,723 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its "own bubble" and often looks away from examples like Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'" Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson.

This message &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5615040/cdc-rfk-childhood-vaccines-autism" target="_blank"&gt;aligns with Health Secretary Robert F.

                The CDC has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧&lt;strong&gt; CDC scientists say they didn't change their website&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Department of Health and Human Services wouldn't divulge who ordered the adjustment to the wording, NPR's Pien Huang tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. There is &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;no new scientific evidence to support the claim&lt;/a&gt; of a link between vaccines and autism. Huang notes that it is interesting that a headline on the CDC's webpage still states that vaccines don't cause autism. However, there is an asterisk next to this statement, which explains that the agency will not remove it due to an agreement with Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who provided a key confirmation vote for Kennedy to become the HHS secretary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump's chief negotiator has presented a new 28-point plan for peace to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.&lt;/strong&gt; International observers are encouraged that Trump has not given up on peace between Ukraine and Russia, but the proposal requires major territorial concessions from Ukraine, which the country has repeatedly rejected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration continues to suggest these concessions because the president is focused on getting a yes to his plan&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Russian analyst Sam Charap notes that for Trump, the details don't matter as much. He simply wants the fighting to come to an end, unlike the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, who are &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;more focused on the details&lt;/a&gt;. Russia desires more strategic territory, while Ukraine has been adamant on security guarantees from Washington and its Western allies to ensure this type of invasion doesn't happen again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump will meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House's Oval Office today. &lt;/strong&gt;This will mark the first time the two will meet face-to-face. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, emerged as a national figure after his primary win earlier this year. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5615169/trump-mamdani-oval-office-communist-socialist" target="_blank"&gt;president has called Mamdani a "communist"&lt;/a&gt; on social media and repeatedly sought to paint him as too radical for the city that elected him mayor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The meeting is a reminder of the shift Mamdani has to make as he steps into the new role&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Elena Moore. The mayor-elect has a background as an activist, but today will be a &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;test for him in balancing his policy priorities&lt;/a&gt; and maintaining political diplomacy. As a reminder, Moore says, the president vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won the election, so the meeting comes with real stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of the Trump administration's interference&lt;/strong&gt; in the midterm elections, which are less than a year away. The president has consistently spread false claims about voting in the U.S. In the spring, he issued an executive order aimed at imposing significant changes to election systems. Although courts have largely blocked the order, he has hinted at the possibility of taking other executive action as well. The election community is concerned that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5599934/2026-trump-midterm-election-ballots-voting-national-guard" target="_blank"&gt;few things voting officials are watching for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deep dive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-97821" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Communities are already experiencing more severe storms, flooding, and heatwaves. Scientists warn that when the planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees, there could be massive, self-reinforcing changes that could have devastating impacts worldwide. These changes are sometimes referred to as climate tipping points. They can unfold over decades or centuries and may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for life on Earth. Here are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5593087/climate-tipping-points-cop30-brazil-coral-glaciers-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;most important and well-studied changes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Coral reefs have been dying around the globe. They are very sensitive to heat, and their loss would destabilize many countries. Numerous people rely on them for food, income and livelihoods. Marine life that can only be found on these reefs would be at risk of extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could melt and result in the rise of sea levels around the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Permanently frozen ground in the Arctic is thawing, which can cause the land to sink, resulting in cracks in the foundations of buildings, buckling of roads and the kinking of pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay up-to-date with the latest news&lt;/strong&gt; from the COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil, with this &lt;a href="https://app.npr.org/curatedplaylist/changingplanet" target="_blank"&gt;app-exclusive playlist of stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet over the past three decades, the bacterium's resistance to oral antibiotics has been growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades"&gt;Powerful New Antibiotic Was 'Hiding in Plain Sight' For Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, scientists from multiple countries sequenced the genomes of 3,489 S Typhi strains contracted from 2014 to 2019 in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and found a rise in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XDR Typhi is not only impervious to frontline antibiotics, like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but it is also &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing resistant&lt;/a&gt; to newer antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, these strains are spreading globally at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most XDR Typhi cases stem from south Asia, researchers have identified nearly 200 instances of international spread since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strains have been exported to Southeast Asia, as well as East and Southern Africa, but typhoid superbugs have also been found in the UK, the US, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The speed at which highly resistant strains of S Typhi have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern, and highlights the need to urgently expand prevention measures, particularly in countries at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/the-bacteria-that-cause-typhoid-fever-are-getting-better-at-evading-antibiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Stanford University infectious disease researcher Jason Andrews when the results were published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning about drug-resistant typhoid for years now.

By 2019, it had become the dominant genotype in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most XDR typhoid strains have been fought with third-generation antimicrobials, like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone_antibiotic"&gt;quinolones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"&gt;cephalosporins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"&gt;macrolides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the early 2000s, mutations that confer resistance to quinolones accounted for more than 85 percent of all cases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Singapore. At the same time, cephalosporin resistance was also taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;only one oral antibiotic is left&lt;/a&gt;: the macrolide, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"&gt;azithromycin&lt;/a&gt;. And this medicine might not work for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin are now also spreading, "threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment". While these mutations have not yet been adopted by XDR S Typhi, if they are, we are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, up to 20 percent of typhoid cases can be fatal, and &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/typhoid-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=Global&amp;amp;YEAR="&gt;in 2024, there were over 13 million cases of typhoid reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future outbreaks can be prevented to some extent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00055-X/fulltext"&gt;with typhoid conjugate vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, but if access to these shots is not expanded globally, the world could soon have another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-top-infectious-killer-claimed-1-23-million-lives-last-year-who-says"&gt;health crisis&lt;/a&gt; on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182576" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/map_4.20.1-642x361.jpg" alt="A world map highlighting regions where the typhoid vaccine is recommended.

It was the first nation in the world to offer routine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/current-vis/typhoid.html"&gt;immunization for typhoid&lt;/a&gt;. A small number of countries have now followed suit or are "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.127848"&gt;planning or considering introduction&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has prequalified four typhoid conjugate vaccines as of April 2025, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.127848"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, which states "these vaccines are being introduced into childhood immunization programs in typhoid-endemic countries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is one of &lt;a href="the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the world's leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the lives of more people than  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;/ &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-a-staggering-154-million-lives-in-the-last-50-years"&gt;Where available, vaccines are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(22)00210-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;some of the best tools&lt;/a&gt; we have to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/emergency-vaccines-reduce-disease-outbreak-deaths-by-almost-60"&gt;prevent future catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in June 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wb0xh000x26nm38yu3ng4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300063b6qbumk9n7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300073b6q4r090ism@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300083b6qydul6auy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute &lt;a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=26/data-item-view/item-number=225/" target="_blank"&gt;will categorize cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300093b6q21z4bafd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Registries &lt;a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=25/data-item-view/item-number=220/" target="_blank"&gt;currently specify&lt;/a&gt; whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000a3b6q17se4l2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            President Donald Trump in January issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000b3b6qobgcy9bm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000c3b6qeiv5yga2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000i3b6qndymsihv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/national-program-cancer-registries/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;97% of the U.S. population&lt;/a&gt;. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly half&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000j3b6q8x3f30pp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000k3b6q5qoca1f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28376186/" target="_blank"&gt;rising rates of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; among people &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5123715/" target="_blank"&gt;younger than 50&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, U.S. guidelines &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/colorectal_cancer" target="_blank"&gt;now recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559177/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas &lt;a href="https://cprit.texas.gov/news-events/articles/cprit-launches-new-liver-cancer-initiative-to-address-growing-texas-public-health-concern/" target="_blank"&gt;initiated a statewide effort&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000n3b6qv1j6fbzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000o3b6qgp5pclwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000p3b6qg7v1cjob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000q3b6qwx1hberc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000s3b6qs3byy5dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000t3b6qqdbrtu5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of CDC data&lt;/a&gt; by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000u3b6q8uj1q6ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000v3b6qe7osu334@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000w3b6q9dgunwe6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038608/" target="_blank"&gt;two to three times&lt;/a&gt; as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000x3b6qx36zw7jo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674526/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2800989" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000y3b6qfw1a8iuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000z3b6qaxwpnekt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300103b6q4xco0rl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300113b6qgw6o8ij7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/988-suicide-crisis-lifeline-hotline-lgbtq-press-3-option-ended-states-backfill/" target="_blank"&gt;stopping specialized services&lt;/a&gt; for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late-night brightness has become a defining feature of urban life. From &lt;strong&gt;blinking storefronts&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;LED-lit streetscapes&lt;/strong&gt;, artificial light surrounds us after dark — a modern comfort we rarely question. But a decade-long study out of Boston is casting this glow in a new light, suggesting it may be quietly undermining heart health while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research presented at the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025&lt;/a&gt; links nighttime exposure to &lt;strong&gt;artificial light&lt;/strong&gt; with heightened stress activity in the brain, inflamed arteries, and significantly increased cardiovascular risk. This emerging connection between environmental light and heart disease isn’t just theoretical — it’s been measured, tracked, and mapped at an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists followed hundreds of adults for over ten years, combining &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/satellite-images-worlds-most-colorful-lake/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81517" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;satellite data &lt;/a&gt;on light exposure with advanced &lt;strong&gt;PET/CT scans&lt;/strong&gt; to assess brain and artery function. They found a clear pattern: the brighter the nighttime light around a person’s home, the more their brain activated stress pathways known to fuel cardiovascular damage. For people living in high-noise or economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, the risks were even higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about sleeping under floodlights. Even &lt;strong&gt;low levels of ambient light&lt;/strong&gt; — like the soft glow from a streetlamp or neon sign — were enough to trigger biological responses typically associated with long-term heart disease risk. And most of us are exposed every night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chronic Exposure, Real Cardiovascular Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Dr. Shady Abohashem of &lt;em&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed 466 adults with no prior heart disease or cancer. Using PET/CT imaging, the team measured two key indicators of cardiovascular risk: &lt;strong&gt;stress-related brain activity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;arterial inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To estimate nighttime light exposure, the team relied on data from the Suomi NPP satellite, which uses the &lt;strong&gt;Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)&lt;/strong&gt; to detect ground-level artificial light, excluding natural sources like the moon or stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their results were stark. Each standard deviation increase in nighttime light was associated with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35% higher risk&lt;/strong&gt; of major heart events over five years&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22% higher risk&lt;/strong&gt; over a ten-year period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the follow-up, &lt;strong&gt;17% of participants&lt;/strong&gt; had experienced a serious cardiovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit:  American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“We found a nearly linear relationship between nighttime light and heart disease,” Abohashem said during the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;official AHA press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Even modest increases in night-time light were linked with higher brain and artery stress.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These stress signals are more than theoretical. When activated repeatedly, they can spark immune responses that cause &lt;strong&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, harden arteries, and set the stage for &lt;strong&gt;heart attacks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;strokes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Light Pollution Joins a Growing List of Urban Health Threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings come as attention turns to how &lt;strong&gt;environmental factors&lt;/strong&gt; — beyond diet and exercise — shape long-term heart health. While air pollution and noise have long been recognized, light has remained under the radar. That may be changing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HCQ.0000000000000139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2025 scientific statement&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt; outlines a framework for &lt;strong&gt;multidimensional sleep health&lt;/strong&gt;, emphasizing not only how long we sleep, but when, how consistently — and under what conditions. Artificial light, even at &lt;strong&gt;low intensity&lt;/strong&gt;, disrupts the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/to-sleep-better-science-recommends-doing-this-1-2-hours-before-bed-and-its-surprisingly-simple/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="87863" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; body’s circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, delays melatonin release, and impairs sleep quality — all of which have established links to cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AHA statement identifies light pollution as a factor that “can suppress melatonin, delay sleep onset and even at low levels has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Boston study’s strength lies in its &lt;strong&gt;methodological design&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike many sleep studies that rely on self-reporting, this one used hard imaging data and satellite readings — a fusion of cardiology, neurology, and geospatial science rarely seen in this field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the research has limitations. It was observational and included a largely homogenous population drawn from a single healthcare system, so findings may not generalize broadly. The study has not yet been &lt;strong&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/strong&gt;, though it has been vetted and presented at a major cardiology conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Compounding Effect of Social Stressors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all neighborhoods face the same&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/discovery-of-a-mysterious-substance-beneath-greenlands-glaciers-predictions-of-rising-sea-levels-questioned/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71366" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; level of risk&lt;/a&gt;. Participants living in areas with &lt;strong&gt;more traffic noise&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;lower household incomes&lt;/strong&gt; experienced a stronger link between artificial light and cardiovascular stress markers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This layered exposure mirrors broader health disparities. Residents in denser, under-resourced urban areas are often subject to more ambient noise, weaker insulation, and &lt;strong&gt;limited control&lt;/strong&gt; over light pollution from nearby buildings or infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers underscore that light exposure is “modifiable” — unlike many genetic or structural health risks. But addressing it will require more than better curtains. It will take &lt;strong&gt;policy-level interventions&lt;/strong&gt; in urban design, energy regulation, and housing standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City governments could implement &lt;strong&gt;shielded street lighting&lt;/strong&gt;, enforce curfews on commercial signage, or adopt &lt;strong&gt;motion-sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; lighting systems that reduce unnecessary illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Adults in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s show up in emergency rooms every day with sudden weakness, trouble speaking, or vision loss. In many stroke cases, a blood clot blocks an artery that feeds the brain. Without fresh, oxygen‑rich blood, brain cells die fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors call these events early‑onset ischemic strokes when they happen between ages 18 and 59. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re less common than strokes in older adults, but they hit people who may be in school, working, or raising families. Many want to know why it happened and whether genes play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMSOM&lt;/a&gt;) did a meta-analysis, searching the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-human-genome-map-could-transform-medicine/"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt; for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of people with early strokes is rising,” said study co-principal investigator Steven J. Kittner, MD, MPH, Professor of Neurology at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These people are more likely to die from the life-threatening event, and survivors potentially face decades with disability. Despite this, there is little research on the causes of early strokes,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittner and his team combined 48 studies and compared about 16,730 adults who had an early‑onset &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/work-stress-linked-to-higher-stroke-risk-in-young-women/"&gt;ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 600,000 adults who had not had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used a genome‑wide association study (&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome-Wide-Association-Studies-GWAS"&gt;GWAS&lt;/a&gt;), which scans millions of common DNA differences and asks whether any show up more often in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each small DNA change offers a tiny clue. Most of these common variants don’t act alone. Many nudge risk up or down by a little bit. Add those nudges across very large groups, and patterns start to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-genome-scan-found"&gt;What the genome scan found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One region stood out: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_(gene)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ABO gene&lt;/a&gt;, which helps determine blood type A, B, AB, or O. The strongest signals in the scan clustered in this region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specific genetic markers there pushed risk in opposite directions, a pattern that fits known biology of clot formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opposite push matters. It signals that some versions of the ABO region raise the chance a clot will form and travel toward the brain, while others lower it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABO gene does more than set letters on red blood cells. It also helps set levels of clotting‑related proteins, especially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Willebrand factor&lt;/a&gt; and factor VIII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with non‑O blood types tend to have higher levels of these proteins, and the A1 subgroup usually sits near the high end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII can make clots more likely. That connection explains why ABO biology shows up in a study of early stroke, which often begins with a clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shared-genetic-signals"&gt;Shared genetic signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested whether the same DNA signals in ABO influence several traits at once. They compared the markers tied to early‑onset stroke with markers tied to von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, and venous thromboembolism (&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/venous-thromboembolism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VTE&lt;/a&gt;), a condition where clots form in veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found strong evidence that the same underlying genetic signals in the ABO region affect all these traits, and statistical tests supported shared causes rather than random overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VTE often appears as a deep‑vein clot in a leg or as a clot that breaks off and travels to the lungs. Doctors already link higher von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels to a greater chance of venous clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic overlap connects these clinical observations to specific differences in ABO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our meta-analysis looked at people’s genetic profiles and found associations between blood type and risk of early-onset stroke,” explained study co-principal investigator Braxton D. Mitchell, PhD, MPH, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association of blood type with later-onset stroke was much weaker than what we found with early stroke.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Real-world blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic markers tell one part of the story; actual blood types tell another. People with early‑onset ischemic stroke were more likely to have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-this-blood-group-age-more-slowly-according-to-new-research/"&gt;blood group&lt;/a&gt; A and less likely to have blood group O than comparison groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The B subgroup did not show a strong association with early stroke in this study, unlike patterns sometimes seen with venous clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These real‑world blood group patterns line up with the DNA signals near ABO. They point to blood‑type biology as a key piece of early stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t know why blood type A would confer a higher risk, but it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-blood-vessels-may-fuel-the-spread-of-cancer-cells/"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots,” said Dr. Kittner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fine-grained-clues-inside-abo"&gt;Fine‑grained clues inside ABO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One genetic marker tagged the O1 blood subgroup and was linked to about a 12 percent reduction in the odds of early stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another marker tagged the A1 subgroup and was tied to about a 16 percent increase. The story is not as simple as “any non‑O type is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These opposite directions help explain why some people with certain ABO subgroups face higher risk while others see some protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Limits and what comes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with its large numbers, the project has limits. It is one of the biggest genetic studies of early‑onset ischemic stroke so far, but it was still smaller than some studies in other diseases, so very small genetic effects may have gone undetected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants had European ancestry, even though the study included people from other backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because genetic variants can differ in frequency and effect across populations, larger and more diverse studies will sharpen the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-stroke-and-future-health"&gt;Blood type, stroke, and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk does not arise from DNA alone. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels, infections, hormones such as those in some oral contraceptives, and everyday habits involving sleep, diet, and exercise all play roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point toward clotting‑related genetics having a stronger influence on strokes that happen earlier in adult life than on strokes that occur at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work can test prevention strategies that mix lifestyle information, medical history, and genetics for people who might benefit most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important and surprising research finding adds to our current knowledge about non-modifiable risk factors for stroke – including a person’s blood type,” said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs at &lt;a href="https://www.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study also highlights the need for future research to sort out the connection of blood group with clotting risk in more diverse populations. This will help us to better understand the strength of this association across different races and ethnicities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000201006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:56:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOZDFEV2FRNjhuSUtzUGN4dG85dFljdC1iTVQzOHNONHZocTlESWFnclF0MklEOXVKZnd4UmJXdjlMYl9yMm4xZXN2LUZTOGRKc2czaElIcjlHamwweURWWWdPcVRTUTRlMUNrbWRyTXJycTNHVDVFYzR1eVhaM3R6RHY0UFZtd08tcmtSb0JIWHZzeVpUdWpYR1ZYb05QRjcxcmc</guid></item><item><title>新药在临床试验中将“坏”胆固醇降低58% - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-lowers-bad-cholesterol-by-58-in-clinical-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A powerful new treatment has emerged in efforts to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-cholesterol-diets-speed-up-cancer-tumour-growth-100-times"&gt;high cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and the associated risk of heart health problems. In a new trial, the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlicitide_decanoate"&gt;enlicitide decanoate&lt;/a&gt; was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol by almost 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team tested the drug in a randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving people with an inherited condition that causes dangerously high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) – the 'bad' type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heterozygous &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22067-familial-hypercholesterolemia"&gt;familial hypercholesterolemia&lt;/a&gt; (HeFH) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is characterized by elevated levels of LDL-C from birth," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;Drugs That Lower Cholesterol May Also Reduce Dementia Risk, Says Huge New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 293 participants with HeFH, who were already taking cholesterol-lowering &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; that weren't having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A once-daily enlicitide decanoate pill was shown to reduce LDL-C by an average of 58.2 percent after 24 weeks. Those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;given a placebo&lt;/a&gt; instead actually saw a slight rise in the levels of LDL-C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In adults with HeFH, enlicitide is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for lowering the level of LDL-C," the study authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More positive results: side effects were limited and similar between the treatment and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; groups, and the benefits of the experimental drug remained consistent over the 52-week trial. Key cholesterol biomarkers associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-factor-in-walking-improves-your-heart-health-more-than-your-step-count"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in the treatment group too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg" alt="Cholesterol chart" class="wp-image-182563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;LDL cholesterol was significantly reduced in those who took the treatment.

The treatment is basically making sure the liver can do its &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;cholesterol-clearing job&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already PCSK9 inhibitors available, but they're administered via injection. Patients are more likely to stick to courses of drugs given in pill form, and here, 98 percent of the trial participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adherence with both the once-daily oral intervention and fasting instructions for dosing was notably high in both treatment groups," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High LDL-C is a problem for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.891929"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, not just those with HeFH. The main negative consequence is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, restricting blood flow and limiting how much blood reaches the heart and brain. Heart attacks and strokes become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, next the researchers want to see if this reduction in LDL-C has any meaningful impact on the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and test the drug more broadly. However, at least for this subgroup of people, we may now have a way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;lowering LDL-C&lt;/a&gt; back to regular levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;Eating Eggs Can Actually Lower Bad Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to get regulatory approval before it can be prescribed, but a phase 3 trial like this one is a key step – and the results are very encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without timely intervention to reduce plasma LDL-C levels," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt;, "individuals with HeFH face an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to cumulative lifetime exposure to elevated LDL-C levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientists in Norway and Australia have developed a “nano-boosted” vinegar solution that enhances acetic acid’s antibacterial properties using cobalt-doped carbon quantum dots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In mouse studies, a single topical dose of the solution eliminated 99.995% of MRSA bacteria within 24 hours and completely cleared infections within a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The research could lead to new non-toxic treatments for wound infections and is a promising step in fighting antimicrobial resistance, which causes millions of deaths annually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vinegar is undoubtedly one of the most versatile tools in both the kitchen and the rest of your home. Not only can you use it in dressings, marinades, and more, but it's also an excellent cleaning agent, helping to keep everything from your countertops to showerheads sparkling. And now, thanks to a few very smart scientists, it might be used to help heal wounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In September, researchers from the University of Bergen in Norway, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, and Flinders University in Australia published their &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on ways to "enhance vinegar's natural antibacterial power," the team shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051122.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team explained that it was able to supercharge vinegar’s antibacterial properties by combining acetic acid — the active component in vinegar, which gives it that signature sour smell and taste — with cobalt-based carbon nanoparticles to produce "cobalt-doped carbon quantum dots."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does that actually mean for people? According to the researchers, this "nano-boosted solution" can kill harmful bacteria such as MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis — a bacterium found in wounds that are difficult to heal — while appearing to remain safe for human use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reach this conclusion, the team tested the nano-boosted solution on mouse models. They found that in mice with MRSA-infected skin wounds, a single topical dose of the solution reduced bacterial levels by 99.995% within 24 hours. After a week, the wounds showed no detectable MRSA infection.

"Importantly, this approach is non-toxic to human cells and was shown to remove bacterial infections from mice wounds without affecting healing."

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is more than just a novel way to treat bacterial infections. The researchers noted in their study that this new solution could help save lives, as "the global fight against antimicrobial resistance… is linked to an estimated 4.5 million infection-related deaths each year."

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They emphasized that there are too few drugs in development to fight antimicrobial resistance, and that most new drugs in this vein are variations on existing antibiotics. In short, they say we need more innovative solutions to fight bacterial infections.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors, however, added an important caveat in the limitations section of the study, noting that wound healing in mice differs "fundamentally from that in humans." Although the scientists minimized those differences as much as possible throughout their research, future analyses with animals such as pigs could and should be conducted, as they can more closely replicate human skin healing. Regardless, this work is a great start.

                &lt;p&gt;Next-generation vaccines could make the flu season less of a snot-filled nightmare—if they ever reach the public, that is. Trial data out this week shows that Pfizer’s mRNA-based flu vaccine performed markedly better than a traditional shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416779"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of a Phase III trial on the vaccine, funded by Pfizer, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The experimental vaccine was significantly more effective at preventing flu than a standard vaccine, the researchers found. The vaccine appears to cause slightly more side effects than others, but there’s a bigger concern: It’s uncertain whether it will be approved in the U.S., given the government’s current skepticism and fearmongering around mRNA vaccine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Better but with a catch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved more than 18,000 healthy adult volunteers in the U.S., South Africa, and the Philippines. It took place over the course of the 2022 to 2023 flu season. People were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the experimental vaccine, dubbed modRNA, or Fluzone, a widely used inactivated flu vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur. Both vaccines covered the four most common types of flu predicted to be circulating that season: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There were noticeably fewer confirmed cases of influenza in the modRNA group compared to the control vaccine group (57 vs 87), the study showed. Overall, the modRNA vaccine was 34.5% more effective at preventing flu-like illness. The experimental vaccine also appeared to generate a higher antibody response to the influenza A strains and a similar response to the influenza B strains (nearly every confirmed flu case in the study was caused by influenza A).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This randomized trial showed that the modRNA vaccine provided both similar and improved prevention of a first episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That added protection may come with some tradeoffs, however. People given modRNA reported more local reactions (70.1% vs. 43.1%) after their shot, such as injection site pain. They were also more likely to report systematic adverse events in general, such as fever (5.6% vs 1.7%).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This finding makes sense, since a vaccine’s adverse events are often linked to the immune response it generates. So a stronger immune response tends to cause more side effects. But while adverse events were more common in those who took modRNA, these events were still usually mild or moderate in severity. In the end, the study researchers concluded that the adverse event profiles of the two vaccines were similar.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The RFK Jr. wrinkle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, the most serious hurdle to modRNA’s approval isn’t its potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his allies have systemically &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-buddies-are-back-to-undermine-vaccines-2000687069"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines during the second Trump administration. Just this week, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;changed &lt;/a&gt;its website to boost the debunked myth that they cause autism. But as much as Kennedy and his buddies may mistrust vaccines in general, they have an especially strong hatred for mRNA vaccines, the newest type of vaccine that first saw wide use during the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;(wrongly) stated&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna were the “deadliest” vaccines ever created, for instance. Anti-vaccination advocates have also falsely claimed that mRNA vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/parents-pack/parents-pack-newsletter/feature-article-are-mrna-vaccines-type-gene-therapy"&gt;gene therapies&lt;/a&gt;, that they &lt;a href="https://www.sierracounty.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx?QID=95"&gt;make people magnetic&lt;/a&gt;, and that they’re causing an explosion in cases of &lt;a href="https://globalvaccinedatanetwork.org/news/turbo_cancer_and_mrna_myth_that_defies_biology_and_physics"&gt;“turbo cancer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These unsupported fears of mRNA vaccines have had real-world consequences. In May, Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; the approval application for its combination flu/covid-19 vaccine (which also seemed to show &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-super-vaccine-for-flu-and-covid-works-now-politics-could-sink-it-2000599293"&gt;greater protection against flu&lt;/a&gt;) after the FDA asked for more data. In August, RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-yanks-500-million-from-critical-mrna-vaccine-research-2000639478"&gt;also pulled&lt;/a&gt; $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Contrary to claims from the anti-vaccination movement that mRNA vaccines are worse or more dangerous than other vaccines, this technology could actually strengthen our defenses against seasonal flu, and not just in terms of improved effectiveness. Since these vaccines typically take less time to tweak and produce than older types of vaccines, countries could wait longer to select the strains predicted to circulate during the season. That shortened lag could then prevent unexpected strains from causing a mismatch with the vaccine (a disastrous situation that’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095"&gt;now happening&lt;/a&gt; this winter).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna has said that it will seek approval for its stand-alone flu shot next year. And given these latest results, Pfizer will undoubtedly apply for approval of its modRNA vaccine, too. Typically, both vaccines would seem to have an excellent chance of approval. But nothing is typical these days.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                Many people who take GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss experience unpleasant side effects. Brain scientists are trying to find ways to avoid them. &lt;br&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have shed pounds with help from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But people who take these drugs often experience unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"They lose weight, which is a positive thing," says &lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/warren-yacawych" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Warren Yacawych&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan, "but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, Yacawych and other researchers held a session to describe their efforts to understand and solve the side-effect problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The weight-loss products are called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They work by mimicking a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could tweak these drugs to suppress appetite without making people queasy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center," Yacawych says. "It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's very challenging," Yacawych says, "to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A possible workaround came from a team led by &lt;a href="https://endocrinology.uw.edu/people/faculty/blevins-j" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ernie Blevins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/28/1152313319/a-new-study-casts-doubt-on-oxytocins-role-as-a-love-hormone" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxytocin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Not just nausea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem," says &lt;a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/DerekDaniels.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Derek Daniels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We had a happy accident in the lab," Daniels says. "And the happy accident involved a rat called the &lt;a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/2/ENEURO.0150-15.2016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brattleboro rat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that "target good places but not bad places," Daniels says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Appetite and addiction&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for "rewarding food, like a burger," says &lt;a href="https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/ali-d-guler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali D. Güler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPcXBROXhOVU1taFBmTjRxSmZYUS1ZZV9uSFczRGN4c1k5REp5WXVGTmJfcF9qWkNUSm8wWFNQeGZlX3VMX1c3WE5Cc29fa3Y3MmhYZjRnbDR2Rk43ZnJKTXJ1NG96VkhJYXZWak43WUZORXhLSVZuNTdNUlYxbXFBc2dVbG1oV1MyeDBZcEg2YlFCQl9xVGxZYUhtQVJOZG02WEE0VlpwNC1OYU9wVld4SnZLWTNpSzNkSG5YOUs5YU8</guid></item><item><title>关于恐慌和焦虑，过去的仪式教会了我们什么--心灵</title><link>https://psyche.co/ideas/what-rituals-from-the-past-teach-us-about-panic-and-anxiety</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy" id="_S_1_"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout our long history, people have always experienced panic, probably even panic attacks. Today, we have sophisticated medications – especially benzodiazepines – that people can use to help them with this panic. Benzodiazepines act fast, and can induce a calming or even euphoric high, which increases the risk of both psychological and physical dependence. But while benzodiazepines are relatively new, panic is very old. So what did humans in other times, civilisations and settings do when they panicked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who experienced panic attacks got burned as witches or accused of being possessed by demons or evil spirits. But it’s also true that the beginnings of a more clinical understanding of panic weren’t as far off as you might think. Greek physicians, such as Hippocrates in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;5th century BCE,&lt;/span&gt; described symptoms resembling modern panic attacks – such as heart palpitations, dizziness, and fainting – but &lt;a href="https://clinical-practice-and-epidemiology-in-mental-health.com/VOLUME/8/PAGE/110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; them under a broader condition known as ‘hysteria’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in &lt;em&gt;The Canon of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (1025) – yes, 1025 – Avicenna (Ibn Sina), described forms of sudden fear and anxiety as part of neuropsychological disorders. Though his explanations still blended physical and spiritual reasoning, his work laid the foundation for a more nuanced understanding of mental health. He wrote: ‘The movements of the soul begin in the heart and manifest in the body,’ suggesting a deep interconnection between mind and physiology. Ibn Sina also discussed what we would now call psychosomatic illness, noting that ‘strong emotions may alter the pulse and colour of the face.’ His holistic view – that emotional and spiritual states directly influence physical health – anticipated principles of modern psychosomatic medicine by nearly a millennium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;bn Sina is just one of many figures from the past who have gained or contributed real insight into treating mental illness, long before modern medicine. Take trepanation, for example – the act of drilling, scraping or cutting a hole into the human skull, while the person is still alive. While this practice wasn’t effective in treating panic attacks or other mental disorders, it may have been successful in nearly half of the cases when applied to physical conditions such as intracranial pressure. We still use a modernised version of trepanation today, known as a craniectomy, to relieve pressure inside the skull – just with better tools and sterile environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to panic attacks, though, force has never really been the answer. Across many cultures, the most effective approach has been to help the mind – or, as Islamic psychology often refers to it, the heart – relax. And for most people, that meant simply &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;cheering up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many peoples and societies have understood that ‘cheering up’ is intimately tied to the senses – especially the ears and eyes. Listening to something soothing often brings comfort. Seeing calming or familiar patterns can promote relaxation. In some cases, an intense or activating sensory pattern might be used to snap someone out of their panicked state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The ritual provides a structured space for emotional release, and reframes suffering as meaningful rather than shameful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for many centuries, across the Horn of Africa and in parts of the Middle East such as Egypt and Yemen, the Zār ritual has been a communal healing ceremony practised primarily by women. It &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4801492/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;addresses&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that closely resemble modern diagnoses of panic and anxiety disorders: shortness of breath, chest tightness, trembling, and dissociative episodes. But, instead of labelling these experiences as purely psychological, the Zār tradition interprets them as signs of possession by a restless spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afflicted person, usually a woman – often someone burdened by emotional or social constraints – becomes the focus of an intense, rhythmic ceremony involving drumming, incense, dancing and chanting. She may enter a trance, during which she might shake, weep or speak in a different voice – seen as the spirit expressing itself. Yet, beneath the surface, the ritual serves a powerful psychological purpose: it provides a structured space for emotional release, community validation, and a reframing of suffering as meaningful rather than shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And away from Africa, among the Evenki people of Siberia, shamans have also long used drumming, chanting and trance to address what psychiatry might call panic, dissociation or trauma. A person experiencing intense fear, recurring visions or emotional paralysis wouldn’t be labelled as mentally ill, but rather as someone &lt;a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ac.2001.12.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;being&lt;/a&gt; ‘called by the spirits’. In a sacred ritual, the shaman uses a large, oval drum – or the ‘spirit horse’ – to enter a trance, sometimes bringing the distressed person into it as well. Within this state, the individual can personify their fear and begin to reintegrate the experience through story, rhythm and movement. Far from isolating the person, the community embraces the event as meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient Egypt too, healing was never merely physical – it was ritual, musical and symbolic. Even when symptoms appeared purely physical, Egyptian physicians often spoke of ‘heart sadness’ as a possible cause of cardiovascular distress, describing conditions where ‘the vessels of the heart close up within.’ One of the earliest known medical texts, the Ebers Papyrus (&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;1550 BCE), &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13070860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mentions&lt;/a&gt; treatments for ‘the trembling of the heart’, likely referring to anxiety-like episodes. Healing took place in sacred sites, where repetition, rhythm and fragrance worked together to restore harmony between the body and the &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt;, the vital spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;What if we re-centred rhythm, sensory input and non-addictive methods of calming the mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a pattern? Exactly – it’s the pattern itself. All those older methods of treatment relied heavily on rhythm, sound, visual stimulation and community support. These elements weren’t just cultural flourishes – they were essential parts of the healing process. And yet, in many of our modern treatments, they’re largely absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, some studies of benzodiazepines &lt;a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.12023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; dependence in &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 per&lt;/span&gt; cent to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;44 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of long-term users, depending on dosage, duration and individual history, after just three to six weeks of daily use. Withdrawal can be brutal – bringing rebound anxiety, panic attacks, tremors and, in rare cases, seizures. Some studies even suggest a troubling connection between long-term benzodiazepine use and later misuse of opioids or alcohol, particularly in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this raises a critical question: what if we went back – not in time, but in principle? What if we re-centred rhythm, sensory input and non-addictive methods of calming the mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 2024, I worked on a brain research &lt;a href="https://research-archive.org/index.php/rars/preprint/view/1542/version/1682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; with Mayar Ashraf that explores the use of sleep-wave simulation as a treatment for panic attacks. Sleep waves are patterns of electrical activity in the brain that occur during various stages of sleep. We can measure them using electroencephalography (EEG). These waves reflect different levels of brain activity – some deep and slow, others light and fast. We looked at whether brainwave entrainment – via external auditory and visual patterns mimicking sleep frequencies – could coax the brain into calmer states. Though still under investigation, this approach resembles a modernised form of what our African ancestors once achieved with drums, chanting and trance. But, this time, it’s not about spirits – it’s about neurons. Still, the wisdom has some similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of clinical psychologists today are using group-based rhythmic breathing sessions, sometimes combined with drumming or humming, to help patients with panic and anxiety disorders. One such method, inspired by Indigenous healing ceremonies, is holotropic breathwork, a structured, fast-paced &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-breathe-your-way-to-better-health-and-transcendence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;breathing technique&lt;/a&gt; developed in the United States in the 1970s by the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof. Holotropic breathwork draws on shamanic and spiritual traditions found among Indigenous peoples of the Amazon Basin, Native North American tribes and Central Asian steppe cultures, where rhythmic drumming, breath control and chanting were used to reach altered states of consciousness for healing and emotional release. Participants lie on mats in a calm, darkened space, breathe rhythmically to steady drumming or music, and are encouraged to express whatever arises – crying, shaking and vocal release are all allowed. Facilitators provide guidance throughout the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden

class="pointer-coarse:-inset-4 -inset-1 absolute"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holotropic breathwork remains controversial in mainstream psychiatry, but a return to sensory and communal modes of healing isn’t regression – it’s reintegration. Science can learn from human history without abandoning clinical rigour, and recognise that ancient practices often held empirical truths, as well as misinterpretations. What Hippocrates observed as hysteria, and what shamans believed was a spiritual crisis, may very well map on to what we now understand as nervous system dysregulation. Rhythm, movement and sound work not because of magic, but because they engage the vagus nerve, stimulate neuroplasticity, and restore balance to an overwhelmed brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, imagine yourself back in that ancient setting – but now with EEG caps and signal processors alongside incense and drums. The future of treating panic might lie not in the time fight between the past and the present, but in understanding how both can satisfy the same human need: to feel safe, seen and soothed. In that sense, history isn’t just a backdrop to research on panic – it’s a map. And we’re finally learning to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;read it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Psyche</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPcTZ1QlNBRzZabkNWX1V3bDhaOFdLTnZOUGFackdkQi1PWTdKY05DVExMbDF2LUxpTjUwWkJncmNTb0t3THl1THFUTld0WTdoczZBcjYtbHpwZTBrVlFqNkVkRWpRSmtZanNNQjRwc2ZaQm95bnhlZjM0TGkyMHJwbmJUUkdsdWRhUC1N</guid></item><item><title>“我的头发成团掉落” —直到这款在售的液体维生素扭转了损伤- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/maryruths-liquid-hair-growth-black-friday-sale_l_691f6101e4b071a086ba26fa</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’ve tried every shampoo, mousse and mask under the sun, you may wonder if anything can help your strands be full and healthy.

April of this year, &lt;strong&gt;my hair began falling out excessively. Doctors couldn’t figure it out, everyone dismissed me until finally,&lt;/strong&gt; through some self-investigation and cycle tracking, I realized it was absolutely hormonal and I was likely hitting early perimenopause. I had been distraught over it for months and in a state of panic, noticing thinning in several spots. These two pictures are less than a month apart. The first is October 24 and the other is November 14 (today)! &lt;strong&gt;Not only has my hair noticeably thickened all around, but you can even see my eyebrows and lashes looking fuller as well!!

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the federal Indian Health Service posted dozens of flyers on Facebook promoting flu and COVID-19 vaccine clinics across the Navajo Nation, where the pandemic had inflicted a staggering toll just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notices, featuring photos of smiling families and elders in traditional clothing, tied immunization to tribal values like community responsibility and made a clear case for getting the shots. “Vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness or hospitalization,” one of them said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this year, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic, has put his stamp on federal immunization policy, IHS’ public messaging on vaccines has taken a stark turn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In internal emails obtained by ProPublica, IHS officials have flagged terms such as “immunizations” and “vaccines” for additional scrutiny, deeming them risky “buzzwords” that require approval from agency public information officers to be used in social media posts, pamphlets and presentations for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through mid-October, IHS had published far fewer posts on Facebook promoting vaccine clinics this year than last, ProPublica found. And in those posts as well as other notices, it replaced language touting immunization’s benefits with wording that frames both routine childhood vaccinations and annual flu and COVID-19 shots as a personal choice, advising patients to consult health care providers about their “options regarding vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current and former IHS clinicians told ProPublica the changes threaten vaccine uptake in Navajo communities and have left medical practitioners who serve this population feeling censored.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It seems to me that they’re trying to put up barriers,” said Harry Brown, a physician and epidemiologist who left IHS in 2016 and now works for a tribally operated health facility in North Carolina. In a 26-year career with IHS, he said, he had never encountered an effort to stifle public health campaigns or restrict what medical providers said publicly about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from Brown, the health care providers who spoke with ProPublica didn’t want their names used, concerned it could endanger their jobs. One physician said the new IHS restrictions on vaccine-related speech factored into her decision to leave the agency this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t keep people safe,” she said in an interview just before she quit. “I don’t have any of the words anymore to say anything I need to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHS’ shift in vaccine messaging has not been previously reported but aligns with widely publicized changes within the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. In the past 10 months, as measles cases have hit their highest levels in decades, Kennedy has been tepid in endorsing the vaccine to prevent the disease while taking several steps critics predict will undermine public confidence in immunization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s launched a federal probe into scientifically debunked links between immunizations and autism and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in contracts and research grants for mRNA vaccines. This technology was central to the speedy development of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, he removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy, replacing them with his own appointments, including several vaccine skeptics. Kennedy has also endorsed &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;the founders of Idaho’s medical freedom movement&lt;/a&gt;, who helped persuade the state to ban vaccine mandates this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IHS, the only branch of HHS that operates its own network of hospitals and clinics, the altered federal landscape on vaccine policy has had a more direct effect on patient care, clinicians said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said the redrafting of IHS’ public messaging materials was designed to encourage “shared decision-making” between patients and their health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Indian Health Service continues to provide accurate, evidence-based information on vaccines and infectious-disease prevention,” the statement said. “Our focus remains ensuring Tribal communities have clear, trusted guidance and access to the care they choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement didn’t address questions about what prompted the revamped messaging or concerns raised by doctors about its potential effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, Matthew Clark, the IHS’ deputy chief medical officer, insisted the agency’s approach to immunizations has remained consistent, even if its messaging about them has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We continue to advocate that every patient at every encounter be offered every FDA-approved and ACIP-recommended vaccine, when appropriate,” Clark’s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear yet what effect the changes are having. Data hasn’t been released showing this season’s flu and COVID-19 vaccination rates for the Navajo Nation. Through September, the uptake rate for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, for 2-year-olds has held steady at around 95%, the level of herd immunity needed to prevent outbreaks, IHS data shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, IHS clinicians said, the agency’s lack of public messaging about vaccines was especially notable during the winter and spring, when a measles outbreak emerged in Texas and then neared the reservation’s borders in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak had spurred alarm. Tribal health facilities, which operate independently from IHS, flooded Facebook with information about MMR shots at the end of February and urged residents to get themselves and their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet two IHS doctors said that at about the same time, the agency installed its new restrictions on vaccine-related speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a March 13 email that Ryan Goldtooth, a public information officer at one Navajo Nation hospital, sent to colleagues, members of the group had been instructed to take down social media posts or flyers that contained the terms “vaccines (namely Measles)” and “immunizations” from the agency’s Facebook pages. “We cannot forward or post to the public,” the email said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email also said that the terms “immunizations” and “vaccines” had been reclassified “from low to medium-risk.” As a result, if clinicians used these words in public presentations and printed materials, they needed to be cleared by a public information officer first, Goldtooth wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email listed several other topics or types of information that could no longer be freely shared or talked about publicly. Starting from the date President Donald Trump returned to office, any information shared from a state health department, for instance, had to be removed from Facebook, the email said, without providing a reason. Any posts about executive orders also had to come down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldtooth, who still works for IHS, did not respond to requests for comment about the email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laura Hammitt, the director of infectious disease programs for the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has worked closely with IHS staffers on vaccination efforts. Limiting what they can say about vaccines could harm their ability to respond to future outbreaks, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are really trying to be compliant with changes required by the administration but also have a responsibility to care for their patients,” Hammitt said. “Those two things can seem to be at odds.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation, the country’s largest tribal jurisdiction with around 170,000 residents, has long been a focal point and challenge for IHS. The reservation is served by four of the agency’s 22 hospitals, but pockets within its 27,000 square miles of mountains and high desert have no cellphone service, internet access or electricity, creating hurdles for clinicians when it comes to communicating information and delivering care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These structural issues had a devastating effect at the start of the pandemic, when the reservation’s rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths were among the highest in the country. The virus claimed the lives of at least &lt;a href="https://nec.navajo-nsn.gov/Data-Dashboard/COVID-19"&gt;2,300 Navajo citizens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the previous decade, vaccination rates among Navajos, especially for MMR and the flu, had regularly exceeded figures for the nation overall. They also exceeded rates for tribal communities in other regions served by IHS, which typically lagged behind the national average, according to the agency’s data. When the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in 2021, Native Americans’ uptake exceeded 60%, an effort bolstered by IHS public service messages and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Navajo Nation, IHS hospitals posted messages on their Facebook pages and circulated flyers that pushed community members to get the shots. “Protect yourself, protect your family, protect your elders,” the flyers said. Tribal members responded, arriving at clinics in droves, lining up in their vehicles to get vaccinated at hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who couldn’t travel to larger towns on the reservation that had health care facilities, teams working for IHS, the tribe and Johns Hopkins set up mobile clinics and made home visits to especially remote communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, IHS and tribal teams on the Navajo Nation sought to extend the COVID-19 shot success to routine vaccines. MMR immunization rates among 2-year-olds had dropped to 85%, but another coordinated effort restored communities on the reservation to prepandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IHS was the engine driving the campaign, said Hammitt, the Johns Hopkins doctor. Agency flyers and Facebook posts retooled appeals used to promote COVID-19 shots to endorse the MMR vaccine, adding a call to protect “future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of this year, however, the messaging began to morph again, with mentions of “measles” and “COVID” disappearing from IHS social media pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The weeks leading up to flu season and the new school year typically usher in a robust vaccine campaign in IHS hospitals. But this year, doctors took note of how few notices went out, they said, as New Mexico continued to contend with the measles outbreak that began in Texas and the Navajo Nation encountered a late-summer surge in COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One exception came in May, when IHS officials shared a New Mexico Department of Health alert on Facebook saying measles had reached Sandoval County, which overlaps with the eastern flank of the Navajo reservation. Another came that same month, when the IHS hospital in the town of Gallup, New Mexico, announced a clinic for people who wanted to get vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IHS hospital in Shiprock, New Mexico, was the only facility to post a public service announcement about a back-to-school vaccine clinic for children. It included language telling patients to talk to doctors about their options and didn’t specifically mention measles, COVID-19 or any other infectious disease as such announcements had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another measles outbreak surfaced in the Southwest in mid-August, this time just to the west of the Navajo Nation along the Arizona-Utah border. In early November, it had grown to at least 200 confirmed cases, according to Arizona and Utah health officials. IHS didn’t issue any advisories or notices on Facebook about this outbreak. The new approval processes for greenlighting public health alerts slowed down local administrators’ and hospitals’ response, the clinicians who spoke to ProPublica noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several clinicians said the restrictions on vaccine-related speech alter the relationship between IHS doctors and patients, even if they apply only to public communications and not to one-on-one consultations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is what we do for a living, and the most important thing we do is explain what’s going on to patients,” one of the doctors said. “If there is an external body interfering with that, as there is now, then that is shaping the fundamental trust between patients and the people trying to provide their care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A week of bad sleep that feels unusual, sharper mood swings than before, a sudden dip in energy that does not match your routine. Many women in their twenties and early thirties brush these changes aside, blaming long workdays or stress. Yet these subtle shifts can sometimes be early clues of hormonal transition. Hidden menopause symptoms do not always wait for your forties and fifties. For some women, the first signs begin sooner and build slowly, reshaping daily life in ways that are easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peer-reviewed study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Fulltext/2020/07000/Early_ovarian_aging_and_symptoms_in_women_under.6.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;journal Menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that nearly 28 percent of women aged 25 to 35 reported symptoms linked to early ovarian function changes. Researchers noted that early hormonal fluctuations can be mild yet persistent, which is why they often escape attention until patterns become harder to ignore. This does not mean full menopause is beginning, but it highlights how sensitive the body is to early changes in ovarian activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Menopause: Beyond the cliches - Dr. Nandita Palshetkar uncovers subtle symptoms and how women must self-care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms and the early hormonal triggers behind them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones rarely move in a predictable pattern. They rise and fall depending on genetics, stress, lifestyle, sleep quality and natural variations in ovarian reserve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these changes become irregular, hidden menopause symptoms start to appear. These may include irritability, low mood, headaches, unexpected tiredness, breast tenderness or changes in body temperature. Because these experiences can look like everyday stress, many women overlook the hormonal link. Yet even small shifts in oestrogen can influence energy levels, appetite, mood and thermoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms and subtle cognitive changes in young women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising early signals is cognitive slowing. Many women under 30 report difficulty concentrating or recalling information that once came easily. You may find yourself rereading messages, losing track of small tasks or feeling mentally cluttered by midday. Research has shown that oestrogen supports areas of the brain responsible for memory and focus. When levels fluctuate, cognitive function becomes less steady, and the brain works harder to maintain clarity. This leads to a subtle, gradual fog that disrupts daily flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms and sleep disturbances that creep in early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disruption is another early and often misunderstood symptom. You may fall asleep easily but wake repeatedly, feel warmer at night or struggle to return to sleep after early morning waking. These disturbances can build over weeks and affect your energy, mood and productivity. Oestrogen plays a major role in regulating core temperature and sleep cycles. When hormone levels dip, your body becomes more sensitive to light, temperature and stress, all of which interfere with deep rest. Over time, even mild sleep fragmentation can reshape how alert or calm you feel during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms linked to mood, anxiety and emotional balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional shifts often appear early and subtly. You may feel unusually sensitive, anxious or overwhelmed by situations that never bothered you before. This is not a sign of weakness. It is a physiological response to changing hormone activity. Studies consistently show that mood symptoms begin earlier in the hormonal transition than most women expect. Changes in oestrogen can influence serotonin, which stabilises mood, appetite and emotional reactions. When this balance is affected, emotional responses may become amplified, unpredictable or harder to regulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms affecting physical comfort and daily routines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical changes may also surface long before 30 but remain unrecognised. These include changes in skin hydration, increased bloating, irregular cravings, vaginal dryness, reduced lubrication, bladder urgency or mild joint discomfort. These shifts do not always appear together. Instead, they show up gradually, making them easier to dismiss as isolated issues. When observed collectively, they suggest the early influence of hormonal fluctuations. Even with regular menstrual cycles, the deeper hormonal patterns may be shifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to do if hidden menopause symptoms are affecting you before 30&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these symptoms feel familiar, the first step is awareness rather than panic. Track your cycle, sleep, mood and physical changes for at least two months. Patterns provide clarity and help your doctor understand what is happening. Medical guidance is essential because early symptoms can overlap with thyroid conditions, nutritional deficiencies or stress responses. Alongside professional advice, lifestyle habits can support hormonal balance. Strength training, balanced meals, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin D and a consistent sleep routine can help. Limiting caffeine after midday and managing stress through breathwork or gentle exercise can also reduce symptom intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms can begin earlier than expected, but early awareness gives you more control. Understanding how your body responds to hormonal shifts helps you make informed choices about health, lifestyle and medical care. If you are noticing subtle changes, it is worth paying attention rather than dismissing them. Knowledge is the first step to feeling better and staying ahead of what your body is trying to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

							&lt;p&gt;Your morning routine probably feels harmless enough. Splash some water, apply your products, get on with your day. But what if I told you that some of your most automatic daily habits are actually working against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years not really thinking about how I treated my face. I was too busy, too focused on other things, and honestly, I figured aging was just inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started noticing changes that seemed to happen faster than they should. Fine lines that appeared overnight. Skin that looked tired even when I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I started digging into the research. Turns out, science has quite a bit to say about the everyday things we do that speed up aging. And most of them are so ingrained in our routines that we don't even register them as choices anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Touching your face constantly throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you rested your chin in your hand today? Rubbed your eyes? Absentmindedly touched your cheek while thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of this habit during a particularly stressful period when I was working long hours. I'd catch myself in video calls with my hand on my face, over and over. Didn't think much of it until I read the &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a13196/why-you-shouldnt-touch-your-face/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on how our hands transfer bacteria, oils, and environmental pollutants directly onto our skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you touch your face, you're potentially introducing irritants that trigger inflammation. And inflammation is one of the primary drivers of premature aging. Your hands have been everywhere: keyboards, door handles, your phone. All that gets transferred straight to your pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this habit takes serious awareness because it's so automatic. I started by simply noticing when I did it, without judgment. That awareness alone cut down my face-touching by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days or when you're indoors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: when was the last time you wore sunscreen on a rainy day? Or while working from home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think sunscreen was only necessary for beach days or summer. The research tells a completely different story. UV rays penetrate clouds and windows. They're hitting your skin right now, even if you're inside reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/news/survey-shows-sun-protection-lacking-in-winter"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; reports that up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds. And UVA rays, the ones responsible for aging, pass right through glass. So that sunny spot by your window where you like to sit? Your skin is getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really got my attention was learning about cumulative UV damage. It's not the occasional sunburn that ages you fastest. It's the daily, unremarkable exposure that adds up over decades. Those few minutes walking to your car. The light coming through your windshield during your commute. It all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started treating sunscreen like brushing my teeth. Non-negotiable, every single day, regardless of weather or plans. The difference in my skin over just a few months was noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Using hot water to wash your face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something satisfying about washing your face with hot water, especially after a long day. It feels cleansing, almost therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what that hot water is actually doing: stripping away your skin's natural protective oils. Your skin has a barrier function that keeps moisture in and irritants out. Hot water damages that barrier, leaving your skin vulnerable to dehydration and environmental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8778033/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hot water increases transepidermal water loss. Essentially, your skin can't hold onto moisture as effectively. And dehydrated skin shows every line, every wrinkle, every sign of aging more prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this shift when I started paying attention to how my skin felt after washing. Hot water left it tight and uncomfortable. Once I switched to lukewarm water, that tight feeling disappeared. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal temperature is tepid, barely warm to the touch. It might not feel as satisfying initially, but your skin will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Sleeping on your side or stomach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one surprised me because I'd been a side sleeper my entire adult life. Turns out, the way you sleep matters more than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press your face into a pillow night after night, you're creating creases and folds in your skin. These "sleep wrinkles" are temporary, but as we get older and our skin becomes less elastic, they &lt;a href="https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2024/05/sleep-wrinkles-are-real-here%E2%80%99s-how-they-leave-their%C2%A0mark"&gt;become permanent lines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing a deeper line on the left side of my face, exactly where my face met the pillow each night. That was my wake-up call. I've been slowly training myself to sleep on my back, which is harder than it sounds after decades of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even switching to a silk or satin pillowcase can help. These materials create less friction against your skin compared to cotton. It's a small change that adds up over thousands of nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Applying products by rubbing and tugging at your skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you apply your moisturizer? If you're rubbing it in vigorously or pulling at your skin, you might want to reconsider your technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think I needed to really work products into my skin for them to be effective. Rubbing in circles, pulling upward, putting in effort. The reality is that your facial skin is delicate, and all that tugging stretches it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: your skin has elasticity, but it's not infinite. Every time you pull and stretch, you're challenging that elasticity. Do it multiple times a day for years, and you're essentially training your skin to stay stretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-apply-moisturizer-6824874#:~:text=Aim%20for%20about%20a%20quarter,to%20do%20this%20at%20night."&gt;Dermatologists&lt;/a&gt; recommend gentle patting or pressing motions instead. Let your products sink in through light pressure rather than friction. This approach is particularly important for the delicate skin around your eyes, which shows damage more quickly than anywhere else on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my entire skincare application routine to gentle pressing motions. It felt weird at first because I wasn't "doing" as much. But my skin responded well to the gentler treatment almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Skimping on sleep regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're busy, sleep is often the first thing to go. I went through years of functioning on five or six hours a night, thinking I could make it up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your skin repairs itself during sleep. That's not metaphorical, it's biological fact. During deep sleep, your body increases blood flow to your skin and rebuilds collagen. Miss out on sleep, and you miss out on this crucial repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266053/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; found that poor sleepers showed increased signs of skin aging, including fine lines, uneven pigmentation, and reduced skin elasticity. They also recovered more slowly from environmental stressors like sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really struck me was learning that even one night of poor sleep affects your skin's barrier function. But chronic sleep deprivation? That creates a cascade of aging effects that compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that on weeks when I prioritized seven to eight hours of sleep, my skin looked visibly different. Brighter, more even, less puffy. It was like getting a spa treatment just from sleeping properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Eating sugar and refined carbs throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This connection between diet and skin aging wasn't obvious to me until I started looking into the research on glycation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what happens: when you eat sugar and refined carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in your bloodstream. Excess glucose molecules attach to proteins in your body, including collagen and elastin, through a process called glycation. This creates harmful molecules called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGEs literally make your skin less elastic and more prone to wrinkles and sagging. &lt;a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/news-and-articles/the-link-between-sugar-and-aging"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that glycation contributes significantly to skin aging and that dietary choices directly impact this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to snack on sugary foods throughout the day without thinking about it. A cookie here, some candy there, refined carbs at every meal. When I became vegan and started paying more attention to what I ate, I naturally cut back on processed sugars. The change in my skin was one of the first things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you can never have sugar. Just be aware that regular consumption of high-sugar foods is doing more than affecting your energy levels. It's affecting how your skin ages at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, aging is natural and inevitable. There's no magic routine that stops time completely. But understanding what accelerates the process gives you the power to make different choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most about this list is how automatic these habits are. We're not consciously deciding to age our skin faster. We're just going through our days, doing what we've always done, not realizing the cumulative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know better, you can do better. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit from this list and work on changing it. Once that feels natural, move to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked on all of these over the past few years, and I can honestly say my skin looks better now than it did five years ago. Not because of expensive products or treatments, but because I stopped doing the everyday things that were working against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your face is with you for life. Treating it with a little more awareness and care isn't vanity. It's just smart maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;World ‘closer to a future free of cervical cancer’&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than 86 million girls in the most at-risk nations have received a vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) – the leading cause of cervical cancer – since 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s according to data published to coincide with the first World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day on Monday. Marking the commemorative date, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was “powerful momentum” globally to end the preventable disease, which kills around 350,000 women globally each year.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The WHO name-checked more than a dozen nations that launched HPV vaccination programmes this year, including Cuba, Pakistan and Rwanda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“More and more countries are scaling up HPV vaccination, improving screening, and expanding treatment, bringing us closer to a future free of cervical cancer,” said Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research shows the HPV vaccine to be highly effective. In 2024, a study revealed that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.positive.news/society/good-news-stories-from-week-4-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;no cases of cervical cancer had been detected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in young women in Scotland who received it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Doctors often emphasize that prioritizing your mental health is important.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to doctors, there is one particular aspect of your health that is often overlooked — and that's pelvic floor health for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials and doctors describe pelvic floor health as maintaining strong and flexible muscles that support your bladder, bowels, and uterus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common disorders concerning your pelvic floor include leaking urine, leaking stool, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clinic in Little Rock has been working to change that and encourages men and women in Central Arkansas to prioritize their pelvic floor health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Sally Oliphant is a doctor at Arkansas Urogynecology and Women’s Health who explained that pelvic floor disorders are often overlooked and under-addressed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think urinary issues may be something women ignore, and think is normal after childbirth or with aging,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why her clinic has been working to alleviate this burden for men and women by utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So we have a cystoscopy tower, and that's how we're able to look diagnostically in the bladder with a camera, and then do some of the treatments for urinary incontinence and inject the bladder with Botox, through a cystoscope. We can also inject the urethra with stress incontinence," she described.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic estimates nearly one in three women over the age of 20 may have a form of pelvic floor dysfunction. Though they suspect the number is much higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One habit that I think a lot of women get into is that we're always in a hurry, and you're emptying your bladder and you're pushing to get it done quickly. And that's really not a good bladder habit to try and push to get all that bladder out,” Dr. Oliphant said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she suggests taking your time, listening to your body, and recognizing when you need to check in with doctors.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's really important not to neglect the health of the vagina, the bladder, and the pelvic floor," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

And that risk could be even higher because of low uptake of the influenza vaccine so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Center for Infectious Disease Research &amp;amp; Policy (CIDRAP for short) at the University of Minnesota has been receiving reports that the dominant strain of flu this season in other parts of the world that get flu earlier — H3N2 subclade K — doesn’t match the new vaccine very well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pamela Gomez, respiratory disease epidemiologist in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, said people should still be vaccinated against the flu. “As soon as possible is the best action,” she told Deseret News, as even a less-than-perfect match will help keep those who get the flu from hospitalization. It should still reduce the severity should one be sickened by influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gomez noted that it’s also impossible to say what will be circulating in the U.S. when flu season really kicks up in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So far, doctors in the U.S. say they’re mostly seeing H1N1, another influenza A that matches the vaccine. But what’s dominant could change, including the H3N2 subclade K, later as other factors like international travel and who’s exposed change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The holidays — and in fact, winter itself — are key times for influenza and other respiratory illnesses to be passed around for a number of reasons. People gather together more indoors, Gomez said. She said it’s not uncommon to see more cases of such illnesses right after Thanksgiving, Christmas or other winter holidays because people come together during those, from extended family meals to special programs to celebrate. Gatherings and travel — think sitting with hundreds of strangers on public transportation — all raise the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="When-should-you-be-vaccinated" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;When should you be vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month would have been dandy, but it’s not too late. Gomez said the prime time to get the most immunity is September and October, but right away at this point is better than not at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This could be the second severe flu season in a row, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. Last winter ushered in more flu hospitalizations than the country has seen in close to 15 years. And at least 280 children died of flu, which is the highest number since public health started gathering the data in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-word-of-warning" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A word of warning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers in Canada are emphasizing the vaccine-virus mismatch to encourage the U.S. and its residents to pay attention to flu, since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been less active on flu than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This is not the time to be flying blind into the respiratory virus season,” Dr. Danuta Skowronski, chief influenza and emerging respiratory pathogens epidemiologist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, told &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;CIDRAP News&lt;/a&gt; last week. The Canadian researchers published a &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on the vaccine-virus mismatch in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Skowronski, one of the paper’s authors, said that Canada counts on what’s happening in the U.S. to help Canada prepare for its flu season, just as the U.S. pays attention to other parts of the world, especially the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is typically May to July and offers a peek at what might be coming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;What goes into each year’s flu vaccine is a best guess by experts who watch what is circulating elsewhere. North America takes note of what’s happening in South America, since that flu season plays out first. But subclade K showed up late in the season, so it did not influence the makeup of the flu vaccine preparation for this year. The early indications from the United Kingdom and Japan indicate it’s going to be a prominent strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But it also is unlikely to be the only strain of flu going around. Vaccination remains helpful. In the UK, the current vaccine has been about 70%-75% effective in keeping children with flu from needing hospitalization. It’s been about 30%-40% effective in keeping adults out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;U.S. public health officials say it’s still a guess what will circulate and dominate here. And Skowronski called the subclade K “a drift, not a shift,” which is clearly better. The subtype, she told CIDRAP, has been circulating in humans since 1968, changing along the way to stay viable against immune system attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="When-vaccination-rates-lag" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;When vaccination rates lag&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;IQVIA, a health information and research company, has reported that in the U.S., retail pharmacies have administered at least 2 million fewer flu vaccines than in the past. The pharmacy numbers matter because that’s where close to two-thirds of flu vaccines are taken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I’m not surprised,” Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of Brown University’s Pandemic Center, told CNN. She said that vaccine skepticism promoted even by some leaders at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Australia, where vaccination has also fallen and subclade K is dominant, there have been more than 443,000 cases of flu, which is a national record, per the article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="U.S.-case-counts" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;U.S. case counts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; that flu case counts are low, but climbing right now, up 2% for the week ending Nov. 8, which was the most recent report available. Most of the cases were influenza A(H3N2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Richard Webby, who studies the flu at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5607250/flu-season-h3n2-influenza-virus-shot"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; that H3N2 viruses “tend to be a little bit more problematic. When we have an H3N2 season, we tend to have a little bit more activity, a little bit more disease at the severe end of the spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC report said 1,665 people were admitted to hospitals with flu this week, but mortality data was not available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Tips-for-avoiding-flu" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Tips for avoiding flu&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Besides suggesting that people get vaccinated, Gomez offered some advice to help folks avoid the flu, regardless of which strain is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Basic hygiene is underrated but one of the best ways to stay safe,” she said. That means washing your hands regularly, especially if you are out and about and shaking hands or touching things other people commonly touch, like door knobs and handrails. Those items, at home and elsewhere, should be disinfected regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Anyone with symptoms of illness should stay home, and away from others as much as possible to help prevent spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Finally, she said to do healthy things like getting good sleep, eating nutritious food and exercising. Those all help one’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOMlN5M2lKOXdvSnh5R0M1NEh0NW9CRTctYndXVVZtTHA3MzdLc1h4aHpoTXlNems4ZGZVVm5qR1gzbUFSZWQ2Q295VE54VWoxQ2FhYWtYVUoxMUNEc0lCVF93eEJDcjA1Wkl0TVhaU2pWVldWSFdkRWZxNWVUUmo1RFNURTRjYjJkdTBtdkV3</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射：研究表明开始和停止的危险- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51407863/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

However, one woman got a taste of the latter even before the holiday began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jsvrx1/aita_for_canceling_thanksgiving/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I the [Jerk?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she explained that, just like each year, her sister-in-law demanded a separate meal due to her ever-changing dietary choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman tried to reason with her and searched for solutions that wouldn’t require her to put in additional effort in the kitchen (after all, she was already going to host the entire family), but it quickly blew up into what her husband called “ridiculous high school drama.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, she asked the internet to weigh in on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;This woman got a text from her sister-in-law, asking her to make a separate Thanksgiving meal to accommodate her fertility diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="sil-special-diet-canceling-thanksgiving-1"

healthy amount of physical activity in your daily life can make a difference in your probability of becoming fertile if you are experiencing problems with ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/11/changes-in-diet-and-lifestyle-may-help-prevent-infertility/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the Harvard School of Public Health, which comprised nearly 18,000 women, discovered a higher incidence of ovulatory disorder in those who consumed more trans fats, sugar from carbohydrates, and animal proteins. On the other hand, those who consumed more iron, fiber, and protein from vegetables had a higher fertility diet score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, “studies have shown that consuming a certain quantity of monounsaturated fats during the IVF cycle increased the success rate by three and a half times, as opposed to women who don’t eat good plant-based fats during that period,” &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/fertility/what-to-eat-to-get-pregnant/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alisa Vitti, integrative nutritionist and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X?tag=vilofjoy-20" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WomanCode: Perfect Your Cycle, Amplify Your Fertility, Supercharge Your Sex Drive, and Become a Power Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include avocados, nuts, and some oils (like olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things people who are trying to conceive should ignore, too. For example, if you’re having continued trouble, your doctor may suggest limiting dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re being exposed to dairy in mass quantities that’s more hormonally-driven, meaning the production of cow dairy has become very chemically manipulated,” Vitti explains. “These excess hormones may disrupt the conversation that the brain is trying to have with the endocrine system, particularly your ovaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can be overwhelming for someone to devise a menu that’s suitable for everyone coming over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving, despite its &lt;a
