Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen said last week that she anticipates more cases in Utah that are yet to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 1,227 measles cases this year, 95% of which were in unvaccinated people or people whose vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said with 90% of Utahns protected by a vaccine, there is "not a need for significant concern" around measles in Utah. Those who have been vaccinated, she said, will experience a milder infection, recover faster and not transmit the disease to others around them. She encouraged Utahns who are not vaccinated to discuss that decision with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., 12% of cases have required hospitalization, whereas in Utah, at least two of the nine cases have required hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the United States cases, over 700 were located in Texas and 89% of cases are connected to 23 separate outbreaks, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;update last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that new cases have been decreasing; however, its latest updates from June don't reflect the recent cases in Utah. It updates its page with new cases each Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash on the hairline typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, Utah's health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:47:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNZlJ3SHFOZFJWY0d0eWlGaVZUa1FXS3JEVl91UEdGd1gyQW5Jd1ZDVThlc1VyV0VualplQkxZU0J2NkRYanBzS2syY1RILVdHcGppeEY2V3BQR1AzOUkzNGZIT0tVaUtrR2pXVjNsSlNndzhmVE9XOU91ZVgzLV9TeWhOeEprb3Rua0pfcERzSXZGbFJlZEthRA</guid></item><item><title>65岁以上仍有患HPV癌症风险的女性，应接受宫颈癌筛查–研究–《卫报》 | Women over 65 still at risk from cancer from HPV and should be offered cervical screening – study - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSzdDXzRCVEtPRmhUTDM5ZXk1T0ZEclh0cVM2U3BZRnR0YmRpcmNYQW5pNHFqUjNDeGNTc0t5bE5KbmxnZFFuSklTbFlrN3JaeU1rc3IxdkRfR0dlSVFPUkliY2pDU2pSck9CRlE2TGdPVUNqQWZndzN1ZXhWdjQ3cHBMNjBtZDNaQ1I0WFlyMXVUUEdwcDlQY2g5VG1hNkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Routine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cervical-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cervical screening&lt;/a&gt;

on cervical cancer states that by 2030, all countries should vaccinate 90% of girls with the HPV vaccine by 15, screen 70% of women and treat 90% of those with cervical disease. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240014107" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Modelling&lt;/a&gt; suggests this would prevent 62m deaths and a cumulative 74m new cases of cervical cancer by 2120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Screening programmes vary from country to country, but most guidelines recommend stopping cervical screening after the age of 65 if previous test results have been normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet global cases of cervical cancer among people over 65 have been rising: in 2022, worldwide there were 157,182 new cases and 124,269 deaths from the disease among women aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the UK, while screening and vaccination rates are higher than many other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/cervical-cancer-elimination-by-2040-plan-for-england/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they have been falling&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. Cervical cancer leads to approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/cervical-cancer/mortality#heading-Zero" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;685 deaths a year in England&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a large-scale observational study published in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Medicine has found that older women are more likely to have HPV infections and to have abnormal cells in test results than younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers in China analysed cervical cancer screening data for more than 2 million women between 2017 and 2023. Of the 2 million, 17,420 were aged 65 and above; the remainder were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found greater prevalence of high-risk HPV infections and abnormal cells among women aged 65 and over than in younger women. Nearly 14% of those 65 and over tested positive for high-risk HPV infection types, compared with 8% of those who were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older women were also more likely to be infected with several different types of HPV and have abnormalities picked up on screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While acknowledging limitations to the study, the findings indicate that “women [aged 65 and above] are a high-risk group for cervical cancer incidence and mortality, necessitating urgent attention from countries worldwide”, the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Most guidelines suggest stopping screening for those with adequate primary screening and no high-risk factors, particularly for women under 65,” they say. “However, the situation differs for those over 65, who may not have been vaccinated or thoroughly screened. With increasing life expectancy, the risk of cervical cancer in this demographic is significantly heightened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Athena Lamnisos, chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said among people over 65, “there is a largely unvaccinated population who, if under-screened or if they have never attended screening, may well still be at high risk of cervical cancer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We would look to the National Screening Committee to examine the findings and see if there would be benefits in reviewing screening age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maxine Lenza, health information manager at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, said: “Recent improvements to the test in the UK means it’s an extremely effective way of preventing cervical cancer and saving lives, so those over the age of 65 and up to date with their cervical screening will have a very low risk of developing the disease. However, women over 65 who have never had cervical screening can request a test with their GP practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS cervical screening programme in England follows expert recommendations on age and frequency of screening by the UK National Screening Committee, which are based on regular reviews of the best evidence globally&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Women with an HPV-positive screening result at the age of 65 are invited for additional screening to monitor their ongoing risk and we would encourage all women to attend appointments when invited to ensure they have the best protection against cervical cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “The screening age brackets are based on robust scientific evidence and an expert recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee, however any women who are worried about their symptoms can speak to their GP who will decide the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is vital that we increase the number of women accepting their invitation for cervical cancer screening within the existing age bracket. As part of our 10-year health plan, those who are eligible will be offered convenient human papillomavirus self-sampling kits – breaking down barriers to healthcare as we shift from treatment to prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona, along with Mayo Clinic, the study analyzed 419 Parkinson's patients with a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project between 1991 and 2015 helped researchers compare Parkinson’s patients with a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk was seen in people living one to three miles from a golf course and the expansive lawns that come with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living within one mile of a fairway was linked to a 126% increase in odds of &lt;a aria-label="developing Parkinson's (opens in a new tab)"

found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in water service areas that included a golf course had nearly double the risk compared to areas without one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk jumped 82% for people living in under water service areas that also had vulnerable groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of PD [Parkinson’s disease] for nearby residents,” researchers concluded in the study, published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833716#google_vignette" target="_blank" aria-label="JAMA Network Open (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The strongest effects were in municipal water service areas with a golf course and in regions with vulnerable groundwater based on the bedrock and topography,” lead author Brittany Krzyzanowski, Ph.D told &lt;a

However, we didn’t include data on pesticides in this study, so future research is needed to better understand what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6366951661112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="ya4ahr7VZ" data-video-id-pending="6366951661112" data-brightcove-id="video_6366951661112_5067014667001-3039" id="video_6366951661112_5067014667001-3039" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;Peter Andre shares emotional moment he’s reunited with his mum Thea who’s battling Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical director of the MS Center at Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey, Dr. Mary Ann Picone, who was not involved in the research, weighed in on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has often been discussion regarding risks for development of Parkinson’s disease and environmental agents such as pesticides,” she told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research is needed with larger groups of patients, but this study does increase the concern about the association between pesticide exposure and risk of Parkinson’s,” Picone added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also warned that &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/us-news/1088965/coronavirus-experts-airborne/" target="_blank" aria-label="airborne (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;airborne&lt;/a&gt;

													MEASURES. WE’RE GOING TO TURN TO FIVE ON YOUR HEALTH RIGHT NOW, AND MORE AMERICANS ARE FACING A NEW DANGER AFTER DARK. RESEARCHERS ARE NOW PREDICTING THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEP APNEA COULD DOUBLE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS DOCTOR FAMILIAR FACE. WCVB CHANNEL 5. GOOD TO SEE YOU. TODD CHAIR OF MEDICINE AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH. SO LET’S LET’S START WITH THIS CONDITION. OKAY. ABOUT ABOUT 30 MILLION PEOPLE. IT’S A SIZABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE IT, BUT ONLY 6 MILLION ARE ACTUALLY DIAGNOSED. WHAT MAKES THIS SO HARD TO SPOT? RIGHT I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT. SO 80% OF PEOPLE WITH SLEEP APNEA DON’T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. WHY? FIRST OF ALL, SOME PEOPLE SLEEP ALONE. OBVIOUSLY THEY DON’T HAVE A PARTNER THAT CAN RECOGNIZE YOU’RE STOPPING BREATHING, YOU’RE SNORING SO MUCH. THAT’S ONE REASON. YOU KNOW, ANOTHER REASON IS THAT TO REALLY FORMALLY DIAGNOSE IT, YOU NEED A SLEEP STUDY. NOW, THERE ARE WEARABLE DEVICES THAT ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO SPOT, BUT YOU STILL NEED THAT SLEEP STUDY. AND SOME PEOPLE, SOME OF US THINK WE’RE NOT SLEEPING A LOT, AND WE MAY WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. WE’RE WORKING HARD, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU’RE NOT SLEEPING WELL, IF YOU WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HEADACHES OR WHAT WE CALL DAYTIME SOMNOLENCE WHERE YOU’RE SLEEPING MORE THAN YOU SHOULD DURING THE DAY, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT IT. SO SO YOU HAVE READ THIS, THIS STUDY, RIGHT? SO WHAT’S THE LINK TO IS THERE A LINK TO GLOBAL WARMING? RIGHT. THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATION. LOOKED AT OVER 100,000 PEOPLE KIND OF RETROSPECTIVELY, AND SHOWED THAT IN THE PARTS OF THE WORLD, THIS WAS A GLOBAL STUDY. AND THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WERE THE HOTTEST, THERE WAS A 45% INCREASE IN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA. 45. THAT’S RIGHT. AND SO IT JUST SHOWS THAT WE KNOW THAT HOT WEATHER DISRUPTS OUR SLEEP CYCLE. IT LEADS TO SHALLOWER BREATHING. IT LEADS TO MORE FREQUENT AWAKENING. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT REALLY IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY. YOU KNOW, OUR AIRWAY ABILITY. SO OUR RESEARCHERS IN THIS STUDY OFFERING ANY SOLUTIONS THERE ARE. REMEMBER, IF YOU’RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE’S AIR CONDITIONING, THAT HELPS. BUT MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT’S WHY I WANT TO TELL YOU AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH, WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE SLEEP CENTER. WE DO 2000 THIS YEAR. WE’RE PROBABLY ON TRACK TO DO 3000 SLEEP STUDIES PER YEAR. OKAY. IT’S RUN BY A NEUROLOGIST, JAMIE JOHNSTON. SHE’S A WONDERFUL MEDICAL DIRECTOR. IT’S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BRIGHAM. AND I JUST THINK I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, GO AND TRY TO GET A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS. BUT IT’S A COMMITMENT. IT’S AN INVESTMENT. IT’S A WORTHY INVESTMENT. REMEMBER, YOU MAY HAVE THE REASON YOU’RE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS REFRACTORY TO MEDS. COULD BE SLEEP APNEA. COULD BE OBESITY, CAN BE LINKED TO SLEEP APNEA, WORSENING DIABETES. A LOT OF THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW, IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE MORE ACCIDENTS. SO THERE’S LOTS OF BENEFITS. WOW. ALL THOSE ALL THO

              &lt;p&gt;An immunocompromised woman’s cat stirred up a lot more trouble than usual (for a cat). In a recent case report, doctors detail how the feline likely spread a seldom-seen bacterial infection that landed its owner in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in Slovenia wrote the report, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/25-0149_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the June issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 56-year-old woman, a kidney transplant recipient, developed a severe, rare bout of &lt;em&gt;Mycoplasma arginini&lt;/em&gt; infection that was eventually traced back to her cat. Thankfully, the woman’s illness was identified in time for proper treatment, and she ultimately recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman first sought medical care after three weeks of swelling, redness, and pain in her left forearm. Though she was prescribed an oral antibiotic, her condition continued to worsen, and five days later, she was admitted to the hospital. By that point, the swelling and redness had spread to her left wrist, which she was barely able to move. Tests confirmed the infection had spread through the main wrist joint, tendons, and skin surrounding her hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors quickly suspected the woman had some kind of unusual germ in her arm, and testing confirmed the presence of &lt;em&gt;M. arginini &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. Mycoplasma bacteria in general are pretty weird, since they’re incredibly tiny and lack a cell wall (some species can also invade and hide inside our cells to replicate, much like viruses). This lack of a cell wall makes them invulnerable to many conventional antibiotics, likely explaining why the woman’s first treatment failed. The woman also reported that she had recently been bitten by her cat on her left arm.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;With the mystery solved, she was switched to more effective antibiotics. And though she did briefly develop other complications, she and her arm eventually improved enough to be discharged from the hospital. Later follow-up visits confirmed her infection had cleared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt; bacteria are commonly found in the respiratory and genital tracts of many animals, pets included. The report authors collected samples from the woman’s three cats and dog. They found some sort of mycoplasma bacteria in one of the cats but couldn’t definitely confirm whether it was &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt;. Still, given the recent cat bite and lack of other plausible explanations, the doctors concluded that her cat was the likely source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are some common mycoplasma infections in humans, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mgen/about/index.html"&gt;sexually transmitted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;M.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;genitalium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt; isn’t one of them. The doctors were only able to find a handful of other cases documented in the medical literature. And as with this case, most involved people with weakened immune systems. People who receive donated organs need constant immunosuppressing drugs to prevent rejection, and the woman had received two kidney transplants, the latest occurring in 2022. While the average person doesn’t have anything to fear from &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt;, doctors treating immunocompromised patients should be aware of its “potential as a pathogen,” the report authors say, especially if their patients are regularly exposed to animals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/treatment-for-dog-and-cat-bites-and-scratches"&gt;Cat bites in general&lt;/a&gt; aren’t something to dismiss, since our furry roommates can carry all sorts of germs capable of sickening even the healthiest people. So you should always quickly wash a cat bite or scratch with running water and soap for at least five minutes. You should also keep a close eye out afterward for signs of infection, such as redness and swelling, and see a doctor immediately if they appear (if you’re in poorer health or were bitten by an unfamiliar animal, you should seek medical care regardless, just in case).&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists found that neurons in both flies and human models of tauopathy accumulate excess glycogen, which disrupts cellular stress management when it can’t be broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) helped redirect sugar metabolism into a protective pathway, reducing oxidative damage and extending lifespan in model organisms. The study also found that dietary restriction and certain drugs can boost GlyP activity, mimicking this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycogen Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in Alzheimer’s models build up excess glycogen, worsening tau-related damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating GlyP reroutes sugar into the PPP, reducing oxidative stress in neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Dietary restriction and drug treatments mimicking it improved brain health in both flies and human neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Buck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging has revealed a surprising player in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia: brain sugar metabolism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, the research uncovers how breaking down glycogen—a stored form of glucose—in neurons may protect the brain from toxic protein buildup and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111333"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)—a well-known intervention to extend lifespan—naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycogen is typically thought of as a reserve energy source stored in the liver and muscles. While small amounts also exist in the brain, particularly in support cells called astrocytes, its role in neurons has long been dismissed as negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications,” says Professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD, senior scientist on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stored glycogen doesn’t just sit there in the brain; it is involved in pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by postdoc Sudipta Bar, PhD, discovered that in both fly and human models of tauopathy (a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s), neurons accumulate excessive glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, this buildup appears to contribute to disease progression. Bar says tau, the infamous protein that clumps into tangles in Alzheimer’s patients, appears to physically bind to glycogen, trapping it and preventing its breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When glycogen can’t be broken down, the neurons lose an essential mechanism for managing oxidative stress, a key feature in aging and neurodegeneration. By restoring the activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP)—which kicks off the process of glycogen breakdown—the researchers found they could reduce tau-related damage in fruit flies and human stem cell-derived neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than using glycogen as a fuel for energy production, these enzyme-supported neurons rerouted the sugar molecules into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)—a critical route for generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and Glutathione, molecules that protect against oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies,” said Bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)—a well-known intervention to extend lifespan—naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They further mimicked these effects pharmacologically using a molecule called 8-Br-cAMP, showing that the benefits of DR might be reproduced through drug-based activation of this sugar-clearing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work could explain why GLP-1 drugs, now widely used for weight loss, show promise against dementia, potentially by mimicking dietary restriction,” said Kapahi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also confirmed similar glycogen accumulation and protective effects of GlyP in human neurons derived from patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), strengthening the potential for translational therapies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says the study emphasizes the power of the fly as a model system in uncovering how metabolic dysregulation impacts neurodegeneration.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Work in this simple animal allowed us to move into human neurons in a much more targeted way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi also acknowledges the Buck’s highly collaborative atmosphere as a major factor in the work. His lab, with expertise in fly aging and neurodegeneration, took advantage of proteomics expertise in the Schilling lab and the Seyfried lab (at Emory University) as well as the Ellerby lab which has expertise in human iPSCs and neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says this study not only highlights glycogen metabolism as an unexpected hero in the brain but also opens up a new direction in the search for treatments against Alzheimer’s and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell’s inner chemistry to fight age-related decline,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding—and perhaps rebalancing—our brain’s hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coauthors: &lt;/strong&gt;Additional Buck collaborators include Kenneth A.

Glycogen breakdown redirects glucose flux to the pentose phosphate pathway and alleviates oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings uncover a critical role for the neuroprotective effects of dietary restriction (DR) by increasing glycogen breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, we show a potential interaction between tau protein and glycogen, suggesting a vicious cycle in which tau binding promotes glycogen accumulation in neurons, which in turn exacerbates tau accumulation which further disrupts cellular homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our studies identify impaired glycogen metabolism as a key hallmark for tauopathies and offer a promising therapeutic target in tauopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 19:32:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9wUXcwY2l2QXgyWTJkX2toZUtYTlg5ZmFNZ01obUdvcTJrN1BEZmR0SnNsUk8zY3ZlYnFoSEFaaDQwc3d6V3MtV09iQTdWdF82aWdpUG1XVkFEaGNFQVlpNXBsaHN1VXZURzBvVGhn</guid></item><item><title>咳嗽药物有望减缓帕金森氏痴呆症-神经科学新闻 | Cough Medicine Shows Promise in Slowing Parkinson’s Dementia - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5QQjFDR0pmcVY3U2MxVjIzUjZoaXpEcEJEc1ZTUDRlTWtmZjN0eFVFbDEtaWc0Y1JQNm5EY2tFVkZwNFdqWWFFSDNRaFdLenh2a1ZCZVJPWmlDaXFRc2dsSXE1NWRRVnhWc1hVUlpqY25yZUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A clinical trial has revealed that Ambroxol, a common cough medicine in Europe, may help slow cognitive decline in people with Parkinson’s disease dementia. The 12-month study found that the drug stabilized psychiatric symptoms, protected against brain damage, and even improved cognition in genetically at-risk participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol boosts an enzyme called GCase, which is often deficient in Parkinson’s patients, contributing to brain cell damage. While not yet approved for use in North America, the drug’s safety profile and early benefits make it a compelling candidate for further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilized Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Ambroxol halted psychiatric decline seen in the placebo group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognition improved in those with GBA1 gene variants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; GFAP, a marker of brain damage, remained stable on Ambroxol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Lawson Research Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia poses a major health challenge with no safe, affordable treatments to slow its progression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Lawson Research Institute (Lawson), the research arm of St. Joseph’s Health Care London, are investigating whether Ambroxol – a cough medicine used safely for decades in Europe – can slow dementia in people with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111329"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows an elderly couple." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/parkinsons-cough-medicine-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When this enzyme doesn’t work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published today in the prestigious &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, this 12-month clinical trial involving 55 participants with Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) monitored memory, psychiatric symptoms and GFAP, a blood marker linked to brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease dementia causes memory loss, confusion, hallucinations and mood changes. About half of those diagnosed with Parkinson’s develop dementia within 10 years, profoundly affecting patients, families and the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Cognitive Neurologist Dr. Stephen Pasternak, the study gave one group daily Ambroxol while the other group received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to change the course of Parkinson’s dementia,” says Pasternak. “This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings from the clinical trial include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Ambroxol was safe, well-tolerated and reached therapeutic levels in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Psychiatric symptoms worsened in the placebo group but remained stable in those taking Ambroxol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Participants with high-risk GBA1 gene variants showed improved cognitive performance on Ambroxol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; • A marker of brain cell damage (GFAP) increased in the placebo group but stayed stable with Ambroxol, suggesting potential brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ambroxol is approved in Europe for treating respiratory conditions and has a long-standing safety record – including use at high doses and during pregnancy – it is not approved for any use in Canada or the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current therapies for Parkinson’s disease and dementia address symptoms but do not stop the underlying disease,” explains Pasternak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest Ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol supports a key enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is produced by the GBA1 gene. In people with Parkinson’s disease, GCase levels are often low. When this enzyme doesn’t work properly, waste builds up in brain cells, leading to damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasternak learned about Ambroxol during a fellowship at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, where it was identified as a treatment for Gaucher disease – a rare genetic disorder in children caused by a deficiency of GCase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now applying that research to explore whether boosting GCase with Ambroxol could help protect the brain in Parkinson’s-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research is vital because Parkinson’s dementia profoundly affects patients and families,” says Pasternak. “If a drug like Ambroxol can help, it could offer real hope and improve lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the Weston Foundation, this study is an important step toward developing new treatments for Parkinson’s disease and other cognitive disorders, including dementia with Lewy bodies. Pasternak and his team plan to start a follow-up clinical trial focused specifically on cognition later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuropharmacology and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e6828384c8808a878e8394929fa6958c8e85c88a8988828988c88988c88587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Debora Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sjhc.london.on.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lawson Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Debora Flaherty – Lawson Research Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.1687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ambroxol as a Treatment for Parkinson Disease Dementia A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephen Pasternak et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambroxol as a Treatment for Parkinson Disease Dementia A Randomized Clinical Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying a variation in the gene for β-glucocerebrosidase is a major risk factor for Parkinson disease dementia (PDD), and raising β-glucocerebrosidase levels lowers α-synuclein in cell and animals. Ambroxol is a chaperone for β-glucocerebrosidase, which increases the levels of β-glucocerebrosidase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the safety and tolerability of ambroxol in PDD, test the efficacy of ambroxol in improving or slowing the progression of cognitive deficits, and acquire pharmacological data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a 52-week, phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial conducted from February 2015 to June 2023. The study took place at a single center and was referral based. Included were patients with PDD who were older than 50 years, had Parkinson disease for at least 1 year before cognitive impairment, had mild to moderate dementia, were taking stable medications, and had a study partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interventions&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambroxol low dose (525 mg per day), high dose (1050 mg per day), or placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and tolerability outcomes were adverse events. Primary efficacy outcomes were the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale, version 13 (ADAS-Cog-13) and Clinician’s Global Impression of Change (CGIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 75 patients were screened, and 55 were randomized. Thirty-one individuals received ambroxol, with 8 patients (mean [SD] age, 78.8 [3.4] years, all male) in the low-dose group and 22 patients (mean [SD] age, 70.7 [7.6]; 19 male [86.4%]) in the high-dose group. One patient was excluded from the high-dose group due to a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 24 patients (mean [SD] age, 72.7 [6.3] years; 19 male [79.2%]) were included in the placebo group. Participants receiving ambroxol (23 of 193 adverse events [12%]) showed more gastrointestinal adverse events than those receiving placebo (9 of 172 adverse events [5%]). Statistical analyses compared ambroxol high dose vs placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence to suggest differences between groups on primary or secondary outcomes. Mean (SD) ambroxol high-dose concentrations were 7.48μM (3.17μM; 95% CI, 6.08-8.87μM) in plasma and 0.73μM (0.07μM; 95% CI, 0.64-0.81μM) in cerebrospinal fluid at the end of titration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mean (SD) β-glucocerebrosidase levels were higher at week 26 (ambroxol, 12.45 [1.97] nmol/h/mg; 91% CI, 11.54-13.36 nmol/h/mg); placebo, 8.50 [1.96] nmol/h/mg; 91% CI, 7.65-9.34 nmol/h/mg; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .05) in the ambroxol group compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of this randomized clinical trial reveal that ambroxol was safe, well-tolerated, and demonstrated target engagement.

That’s when an ultrasound discovered the devastating news — which Bowler was told while he was driving to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He asked if I was sitting down. I told him I was driving, and he asked me to pull over,” he said, adding that’s when “I knew it was bad news. He said they suspected cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumor, he said, was &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-of-4-stage-4-melanoma-under-fingernail-spreads-to-brain-8779683" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:melanoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt; — the most lethal form of skin cancer. While skin cancer is the “most common type of cancer” in the U.S., according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; melanoma accounts for only about 1% of cases. Still, it “causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Bowler / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Simon Bowler shares a photo while undergoing treatment for invasive skin cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, he underwent a successful surgery to remove the tumors and began a yearlong course of &lt;a href="https://people.com/immunotherapy-breakthrough-could-mean-fewer-cancer-patients-need-chemo-11724110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immunotherapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. But nine months later, Bowler says he knew something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms he had experienced when the lump was first discovered returned, he explained: “To be honest, I didn't feel right in my head. I started having blurred vision again, and I couldn't switch off at night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer had &lt;a href="https://people.com/teddi-mellencamp-sobbing-extreme-pain-brain-tumor-diagnosis-11696738" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spread to his brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spread to his brain&lt;/a&gt; — or as he said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/simon-bowler-the-start-of-my-journey-and-only-17-months-in" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;, “I had 2 minuscule melanoma cells in my brain. The consultants reassured me that following my neck procedure this was not uncommon,” and the treatment prescribed was targeted radiation to “zap it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in March 2025, Bowler struggled with the treatment, having a severe gastrointestinal reaction that caused him to be hospitalized for 10 days. While there, he had an adverse reaction to steroids, which caused nerve damage to his limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt numb, battered. It was like I'd been hit by a truck. I've got wobbly legs now and a right hand that can barely grip a racket, let alone type. But I'm still trying,” said Bowler, who shared that he's thankful for the support of his wife, Tracey. “That hospital stay nearly broke me. When I got home, I'd just burst into tears for days. It stripped away everything that felt like me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Bowler / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Simon Bowler with his wife, Tracey.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with paying for treatment, the GoFundMe is intended to help Bowler launch a company that makes tennis accessories, as he’s struggling to work. “With my physicalities as they are, a successful lesson is me not falling over,” he explained in the fundraiser, which is also donating to mental health and cancer charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he told &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, “It's OK to cry. It's OK to admit you're not OK. I've been stripped of a lot of my identity — but I haven't lost my will to keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just want to get back to helping people, mentoring young players, and showing them what resilience looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/tennis-pro-gets-intoxicated-after-one-drink-lethal-sign-11764264" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 18:19:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFA0WEREZmVMNzVJVzBWdTZWcXZ2QlZpSUlta3gyTW9BVHBSUHNTc0xlTkVNUy1Oa3ZvUUV3LXB2Uzl4Y0JNWWF6VzZDZGkwRlZLd2d3eWRnNnpYaE5WOGdfbnl5NEgzVGIyXzYwSzBHaUtwbVJl</guid></item><item><title>气候变化正在改变传染病的地理位置--法国24 | Climate change is changing the geography of infectious disease - France 24</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxObTFCZ0tEaE9BR0ZNM1NfNmpKZ3hFY1dteUhWcEMyN1N4ZDZqdnF1YUNzajhSVjBnbjJOM0pqWmVnajdtUHNyd3hGLXQxUGVsUXJIWFBKbVZYbnd6VGp5WEtxUEVpV2FodU03dUdWZkpUSmhpaGtHVWdZSFZ0Mi1KaVZ0bndMamk3ZUVWSE5ydHB2TjNaa0pXbUhZQUVNZGVYaU4zbU85SXp0aXBuckt6RFJ0c09ILVlyd251aU40YmRSTDA4aFV1UUc5OA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="a-loader-error__content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CASPER, Wyo. — The Wyoming Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles in an unvaccinated child from Natrona County. This case is the first reported in Wyoming since 2010.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was in the Banner Wyoming Medical Center Emergency Department Waiting Room while infectious on June 24 from roughly 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and on June 25 from 12:55 to 2:55 p.m. People in the location at those times were possibly exposed to measles. The WDH reports that it is working with Banner Wyoming Medical Center to notify these individuals.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are asking individuals who were potentially exposed to self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days past the exposure date, and consider avoiding crowded public places or high-risk settings such as daycare centers,” WDH state health officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said.






&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the child’s measles exposure was not identified.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious infection that can cause severe illness. People exposed to measles typically develop symptoms seven to 21 days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, coughing, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash that usually starts several days later on the face and spreads down the body.





&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have received the MMR vaccine or were born before 1957 are generally considered immune.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjijo00123b760qx6zt7s@published"&gt;My boyfriend wants to be pegged. I am usually pretty open to trying things, but for some reason, this is a hard no for me. The thought actively turns me off. My boyfriend is having a hard time accepting my hard no because so far I haven’t turned him down for anything else. How do I get it through his stubborn head that this is not going to happen?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjipx00153b76yl7at7js@published"&gt;The first time we say no to someone is often when we find out how they actually act when it comes to respecting the boundaries of others. This is one of those moments that tells you something important about who you’re dating. Are they able to hear you saying, “No” and accept that? Or are they going to push, wheedle, and whine until they break down your resolve? And, for the record, engaging in acts that are a hard no for you (for whatever reason) strikes me as going beyond &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/good-giving-game-research-confirms-dan-savages-sex-advice-works/"&gt;good, giving, and game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From there, you’ll have to decide whether you want to leave the relationship. You do get to choose your path forward here. Go ahead and weigh what you get out of the relationship and how important it is to you. Consider whether your boyfriend’s stubbornness has caused difficulties in other areas, and whether there have been other instances—maybe outside of your sex lives—where he’s steamrolled your boundaries or even preferences. Once you’ve thought through the whole dynamic, a single ultimatum is worth a try. Something along the lines of, “I’ve said this is a hard limit for me on multiple occasions, and if you continue to pursue this, I will end our relationship” should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjted001j3b7670gxlnzy@published"&gt;My wife, a 33-year-old woman, and I, a 36-year-old man, got married six months ago after a three-year dating period. It’s the best choice I’ve ever made in my life, and she’s the light of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtee001k3b76xd5lslbu@published"&gt;She was always a little concerned about her body image. Before the wedding, it got more intense as she went on a big kick to get herself thin for the “perfect” wedding dress. She looked amazing, and I did my best to support her in that process. After the wedding, during the honeymoon, and after, she stopped counting calories for the first time since I got to know her. As a result, she’s easily put on maybe 30 to 40 pounds, and I cannot tell you how much I’ve enjoyed this process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckr891f00603b76qxg975jp@published"&gt;Eating dinner and splitting desserts with her has made dinners more fun, getting drunk-ish with her a couple of times a month has been a shared joy, and she’s been more inclined to let loose. If I’m honest, she looks better for it. She still eats a healthy balance of foods, and she hasn’t stopped exercising, but she doesn’t do either of those things with the fanatic attention or self-starving ethos she once had (and maybe concerns me in retrospect). She’s still the woman I fell in love with and wanted to marry, but more carefree, less on-edge, and simply happier.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjteg001l3b76jxa416rx@published"&gt;The problem is that she keeps mentioning the weight as stuff that “needs to go.” When I compliment her looks, she will describe this stage as “temporary” and even made the joke that I need to say “goodbye” to her breast growth. When I’ve tried to bring up her change in mood, it gets shut down by her getting concerned about the appearance of her thighs or other parts of her body. Every time I try to be positive about her body, she will immediately start nitpicking and almost spiraling. On one hand, I love this woman and will support her in just about any choice she makes about her appearance that isn’t harmful to her health, and know that her relationship to self-image isn’t one I can internalize but one I can empathize with and find pathways to be supportive of. On the other, I want to share my perspective that she’s the happiest, most relaxed, and sexiest version of her that I’ve known. Any ideas on how to approach this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtei001o3b76onkr2atd@published"&gt;In your letter, you describe giving your wife compliments on her body, and also bringing up these recent changes to her mood. She might be receiving the latter as criticism of her mood and behavior in those previous moments. If you haven’t tried this yet, you might lead with something closer to what you wrote in your second-to-last line—plainly and simply stating what you appreciate about her mood at this time, and avoiding comparisons to previous times. Stay entirely focused on her demeanor and the way you perceive her level of happiness. I want to caution you to remember that we can state our perspectives, but we can’t guarantee that the person we’re expressing ourselves to will hear, much less internalize, what we’re saying to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtek001p3b76iy4zweum@published"&gt;Your wife, like many others who are unhappy with their bodies, has responded to your physically-driven compliments with self-criticism, so I’d steer clear of those for a while. And framing positive feedback about her current state in terms of improvement over the past could be landing as negativity, crucially, about what she feels she has to do to have the body she prefers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcknjtek001q3b76m3q0edu9@published"&gt;You’re absolutely correct that her body and her relationship to self-image are hers to sort through or change if she desires. Shoring up the self-esteem of our loved ones is often romanticized, but in reality, there’s little we can do to instill in them a sense of satisfaction around something they’re sensitive about. If you’re looking for ways to be supportive, get curious about why a certain weight or shape means so much to her. Ask her how important being happy is, what gives her feelings of happiness, what “relaxed” means to her, and how much she values that, too. From there, you might understand more about where she’s coming from or be able to support her happiness and relaxation in areas other than her relationship to her body.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, one woman, “Bailey,” asked if she could include her new boyfriend, “Ron.” After talking it over with everyone, we agreed so long as Ron gets screened for STIs first. Bailey was insulted and got angry that we didn’t think Ron was “clean.” I told her we are just being cautious and would ask this of any new person. This is a reasonable request, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, it’s great to work with members of any group we’re a part of to understand moments where feelings were hurt and decide how to navigate them. Also, though, without knowing Ron’s status for various STIs, you don’t know what Becca is being exposed to and therefore may be bringing into the group.&lt;/p&gt;

But sometimes, these seemingly banal experiences signal something more serious, like an infection, blood disorder, or autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms aren’t waning—or your gut is telling you something just isn’t right—it may be worth talking to your doctor. Ahead, learn more about 20 everyday symptoms that may be signs of a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bloodshot Eyes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons you might have bloodshot eyes. According to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14908-cory-fisher" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cory Fisher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cory Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a family medicine physician at Cleveland Clinic, red eyes are often caused by conjunctivitis (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26391702/pink-eye-or-allergies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pink eye;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pink eye&lt;/a&gt;)—an infection involving common &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a22498824/cold-vs-flu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cold symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cold symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, like a runny nose, sore throat, and cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if your bloodshot eyes aren’t going away, you might have a bigger problem. “If the red eyes are prolonged—longer than a week or so—or come with pain or vision changes, it may indicate something more serious, like a deeper infection of the eye or glaucoma,” he says. Glaucoma is a serious condition that can cause vision loss and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;DawnPoland - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Smelly Vaginal Discharge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking care of your vaginal health is incredibly important for your well-being. Case in point? Having foul-smelling discharge could actually be a sign of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection of your reproductive organs that’s usually caused by a sexually transmitted disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9129-pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an STD—like gonorrhea or chlamydia—isn’t properly treated, the infection can spread and cause chronic pain and infertility, in addition to abnormal discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Maria Korneeva - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skin Rashes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin rashes can certainly mean nothing. Maybe your skin was just exposed to an allergen or is too dry and needs some lotion, says Dr. Fisher. But they can also be an early symptom of something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Occasionally, a skin rash can be part of a more significant disease process. Be more concerned if the rash is painful, spreading rapidly, or not responding to initial treatments,” he explains. “Many disease states can present with a rash, including some infections, hematologic diseases, or connective tissue disorders, like lupus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;chokja - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dry Mouth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, there may be an easy fix: Hydrate. But if lack of fluids isn’t the issue, another possibility is Sjogren’s syndrome—an autoimmune disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth, among other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s possible to develop the syndrome at any age, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fsjogrens-syndrome%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20353216&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-conditions%2Fg65224049%2Feveryday-symptoms-serious-disease%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says it’s more common in women over 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Portra - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excessive Sweating&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sweating could be the result of a common disorder called hyperhidrosis, which affects around 3% of the population.

But if you’re constantly craving ice, that could be a sign of pica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pica is a disorder where you have an appetite for items people wouldn’t normally consider food—like dirt, paper, and chalk, which have no nutritional value.

And, when you go to Italy, or even read about going to Italy, it does make you wonder. They eat cookies for breakfast. Lunch and dinner are typically multicourse meals, with a pasta or risotto as a first course and a meat dish as a second. There are sometimes antipasti as well. Even &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34067077/" target="_blank"&gt;schoolkids&lt;/a&gt; often get multicourse meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZFUUSGLTNZET5GK7L5DMJP75BM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the foods! Charcuterie! Cheese! Ravioli! Pizza! Focaccia! Gelato! On its face, it doesn’t seem like a recipe for avoiding weight gain. Yet, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#country/106" target="_blank"&gt;U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the obesity rate among Italian adults was 17 percent in 2022. In the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#country/231" target="_blank"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, it was 42 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VOD6OX7AR5DYDKPW2R3PCZYPXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because I know you come here for hard-nosed empiricism, let’s take a look at what we know about the differences in Italian and American diets. But don’t expect it to tell us much. Countrywide data is a blunt-force instrument: Many other things vary from country to country, and data is often collected in different ways. Still, let’s set the stage. (Unless otherwise noted, the data is from the FAO.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="T2UFQYFWRBHDVARCP74XKOFVB4" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italians &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=ESP~CHN~BGD~GBR~GRC~ZAF~IND~ITA~USA" target="_blank"&gt;eat more fish&lt;/a&gt; than Americans do, 64 pounds per person per year to Americans’ 49 pounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They drink &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption" target="_blank"&gt;quite a bit less alcohol&lt;/a&gt; overall, according to data from the World Health Organization. To account for differences in the alcoholic content of beer, wine and spirits, the numbers are expressed as pure alcohol: 1.9 gallons worth per year for Italians vs. 2.6 gallons for Americans. But they drink more &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wine-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=ITA~USA" target="_blank"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;: enough to contain 1.1 gallons of pure alcohol for Italians, 0.4  gallons for us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the International Pasta Organization  (and really, it should know), &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/annual-report/" target="_blank"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; eat more pasta (51.2 pounds per person per year) than anyone on Earth. At &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/news/wpd-2024-in-philadelphia-how-pasta-won-the-hearts-of-americans/" target="_blank"&gt;19.4 pounds&lt;/a&gt;, Americans don’t hold a candle to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though vegetables are a vaunted part of the Mediterranean diet, Italians &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/vegetable-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=IDN~WSM~KAZ~ITA~USA" target="_blank"&gt;don’t eat more vegetables &lt;/a&gt;than Americans do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italians do, however, eat much less meat. Americans eat &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-type?country=USA~PRT~JPN~OWID_WRL~ESP~DEU~ITA" target="_blank"&gt;67 percent more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Italians also eat slightly less added sugar, &lt;a href="https://www.helgilibrary.com/charts/sugar-consumption-per-capita-rose-174-to-322-kg-in-italy-in-2021/" target="_blank"&gt;71 pounds per person&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, compared to 74.3 pounds &lt;a href="https://www.helgilibrary.com/indicators/sugar-consumption-per-capita/usa/#:~:text=Sugar%20consumption%20per%20capita%20reached,of%2026.6%20kg%20in%201985." target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Relatedly, Italians drink less soda. It’s hard to find comparable data, but U.S. consumers buy an average of about&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8676708/" target="_blank"&gt; 37 gallons&lt;/a&gt; of soda a year, about three times what &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8676708/" target="_blank"&gt;Italians drink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They certainly don’t eat low-carb; Italians get a slightly higher percent of calories from &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-dietary-energy-supply-from-carbohydrates-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; than Americans do (48.5 percent vs. 46.4 percent).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKRKXCP2KBGNLCFDNHDD5HUBRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To avoid American-style weight gain, though, Italians don’t have to eat differently; they just have to eat less. That’s the simple thermodynamic truth. And although eating different foods can certainly contribute to eating less, many other factors come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MQ3AYRG7Y5ADDGKQB2ZRRWJPKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two of them, in particular, are on vivid display in Italy. Two really important ones, which could easily account for the weight-gain gap: portion size and snacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LYSWJZDJSRG4POC2PDQYVFASIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many years ago, U.S. de facto nutrition-expert-in-chief &lt;a href="https://www.foodpolitics.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;Marion Nestle&lt;/a&gt; told me that portion size in the U.S. could single-handedly account for all the excess calories Americans consume; when portion sizes double, we eat, on average, about &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.12.0303" target="_blank"&gt;a third&lt;/a&gt; more. Italian portions of just about everything are smaller, although it’s impossible to say just how much. (When I asked Nestle whether there was any rigorous assessment, she laughed in my face, to the extent you can do that by email.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ABI7MMU3JCU5HTDWCK3SCAGUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Snacking, though, may be an even bigger issue, and it is just as resistant to reliable data. But all the Italians I spoke with, including faculty members at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in northern Italy, agreed. Eating between meals (or after dinner) isn’t nearly as common in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PF44DLOPUJBD5BL76CPUI3POYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it’s not just about eating between meals. It’s about living in a food environment that doesn’t facilitate eating between meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YFOSORXIIFFQDETWNI3DDNEDJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I spent time in both small towns and large cities in the northern half of Italy, and there wasn’t food everywhere. The only foods I saw people eating on the street were gelato (a lot!) and focaccia or pizza (not as much). There weren’t places to duck in and get a quick Frappuccino. There were no shops selling giant cinnamon buns, or pretzels, or soda. The pharmacies and hardware stores didn’t have a rack of candy and salty snacks at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSZ2MJXT2FGTPFLY2HIZSORRIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The places where there was food had very little that you could just pick up and eat. The outdoor markets (and most cities have one) had stall after stall stocked with vegetables, fruit, cheese, charcuterie, bread and meat (alongside clothing, housewares and leather goods). But there were no funnel cakes. There were no smoothies. There were no corn dogs. People browsed the markets without eating. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W32WA55PYVFITOXHMCMY4G26FQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And now the question changes. Why have the people who created the American food environment — Big Food, but also many smaller producers and franchises — been so much less successful in Italy than other places? &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00394-021-02733-7.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Italians eat less processed food&lt;/a&gt; than Americans do, but they also eat less of it than almost anyone in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5LAB7YW4VVD5VFZ6ZRKSXCLNXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m certainly not going to swan in, spend a month in the country and form a theory about how food is wrapped up in Italian identity. There are people who spend their entire careers studying Italian food culture, which has no simple through-line. Italy, as we know it, didn’t even exist until the 19th century, and scholars argue about the origins of some of the foods we think of as iconically Italian (pasta and pizza, for starters). Historian Rachel Laudan, author of “&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/45HkAxK" target="_blank"&gt;Cuisine and Empire&lt;/a&gt;,” told me that it wasn’t until about the 1960s that what we think of as Italian food fed most Italians. Before that, meat, cheese and eggs — key ingredients of the Italian menu — were mostly unaffordable for the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FHOTWNEVORETPLY5YXKX2VSD64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However it happened, there’s no question that food, and a way of eating it, is central to many Italians’ sense of Italianness. And a cuisine that forms part of a national identity is something America, a nation of immigrants, doesn’t have. Although I’m a big fan of a patchwork food culture where I can enjoy food from around the world, food here is something we eat, not something we are, so we never had that bulwark against the incursion of cheap, junky food everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="633KZGQ2HZEXNGTVGUFXU6HBXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m not sure Italians can hold out forever. For the time being, they’re maintaining a way of eating that means they eat less; there are about &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-supply#caloric-supply" target="_blank"&gt;200 calories fewer per person&lt;/a&gt; per day in their food supply than in Americans’. But obesity &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/obesity-prevalence-adults-who-gho?tab=chart&amp;amp;country=WHO_EUR~WHO_AFR~WHO_AMR~WHO_SEAR~WHO_WPAC~WHO_EMR~ITA" target="_blank"&gt;is on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, reports the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BKMXS67WRAN7NYC2FGBPLUWUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But if you ever wonder why Americans are fat and Italians aren’t, spend a month in their shoes. Sure, there are differences in what we eat.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'go-to' way many clinicians measure healthy weight may be deeply flawed, according to new research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A population study from the University of Florida (UF) has found that BMI, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt;, is not the best option for predicting future health risks associated with weight – not by a long shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another method, which directly measures body fat and has been around for decades, has now put BMI to shame. &lt;span&gt;It's called a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioelectrical_impedance_analysis"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bioelectrical impedance analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (BIA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nationally representative analysis, those with high body fat levels, as measured by BIA, faced a&lt;span&gt; 262 percent increased risk of death from heart disease compared to those with lower levels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-obesity-definition-shifts-focus-from-bmi-heres-the-science-behind-it?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;New Obesity Definition Shifts Focus From BMI – Here's The Science Behind It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BMI scores, &lt;span&gt;which simply compare a person's weight to their height&lt;/span&gt;, failed to turn up any significant association with mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Let's face it, the magnitude of risk this study shows is enormous," cardiologist Andrew Freeman, who was not involved in the study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/bmi-versus-body-fat-wellness"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; CNN's Sandee LaMotte. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's scary to think that we may have been using a surrogate – BMI – that may not have been all that accurate over the years."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166339" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIA-device-642x856.jpg" alt="BMI Is an Awful Mortality Predictor.

Some medical organizations have even advised doctors to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-weeks-ago-the-bmi-was-quietly-wound-back-as-the-go-to-weight-measure-in-the-us"&gt;deemphasize the use of BMI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health services researcher, Arch Mainous, and his colleagues at UF have now proposed a much-needed alternative, and it takes less than a minute to carry out. BIA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a direct measurement of body fat using a portable, inexpensive device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The contraption works by sending a weak electric current into body tissue to determine muscle and fat composition. The technology has been commercially available since the 1980s, but only recently have modern fitness trackers and smartwatches begun to incorporate BIA sensors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166281" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice-642x254.png" alt="BIA Wrist Device" class="size-medium wp-image-166281" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice-642x254.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice-600x237.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BIAdevice.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166281" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;BIA wrist device.

"This is the ultimate Coke versus Pepsi test. And BMI failed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure, BMI is simple and easy to compute, but it comes with some serious limitations. People who are muscular, for instance, can sometimes be deemed overweight or obese. And on the flip side, those who have a normal BMI but elevated body fat percentages may be unaware that they may face added health risks, such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or type 2 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mainous and colleagues argue that BIA is a more accurate alternative, and the devices that measure it are inexpensive and compact enough to become a regular feature of medical clinics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The UF team predicts that if their results are validated in larger and more diverse cohorts, "it is likely that measuring body fat percentage with BIA will become a standard of care".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These data will drive better discussions in the doctor's office as well as public health initiatives with the goal of improving the health of all," the researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.240330"&gt;&lt;span&gt;conclude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.240330"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Annals of Family Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In the early days of the West Texas measles outbreak, Thang Nguyen eyed the rising number of cases and worried. His 4-year-old son was at risk because he had received only the first of the vaccine’s two doses.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;So, in mid-March, he took his family to a primary care clinic at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By the end of the visit, his son, Anh Hoang, had received one shot protecting against four illnesses — measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. He also received a second shot against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, as well as a flu shot. His twin daughters, who had already had their measles vaccinations, got other immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nguyen, who is a UTMB postdoctoral fellow in public health and infectious disease, said he asked clinic staff whether his family’s insurance would cover the checkups and immunizations. He said he was assured that it would.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Then the bills came.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="ac3a4283-803b-47d5-a180-ef6d6dba8eae" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The medical procedure&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The first measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-measles-vaccination"&gt;licensed in 1963&lt;/a&gt; and became part of the combination measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in 1971. Today the vaccine against chickenpox, or varicella, is sometimes combined into what is known as the MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A first dose of the measles vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months, with a second between ages 4 and 6. Experts may recommend vaccinating children at younger ages during an outbreak — like the ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, which has led to more than 1,200 cases, 750 of them in Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 95% of the cases have occurred in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccine status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Recommendations affecting administration and insurance coverage are made by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;. In mid-June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the committee, adding vaccine skeptics. The new panel, which &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/"&gt;met last week&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to scrutinize past recommendations, including for the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;h3 id="cba1b003-6cb6-4bfb-ac49-8b6d8683bd1f" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The final bill&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/48732a34914bec5eea15825e5cce6c5e/0629%20Nguyen%20Measles%20Bill%20KFF"&gt;UTMB billed $2,532&lt;/a&gt; for the boy’s office visit and three shots. The MMRV shot alone was billed at $1,422, plus $161 for administering it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="b439648f-c239-45f8-a7a2-43d2d38208d4" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The billing problem: Coverage gaps and provider ‘errors’&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;There are guardrails in the U.S. health system intended to prevent recommended vaccines from being prohibitively expensive. They did not help the Nguyen family.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Their health plan, purchased from &lt;a href="https://taianfinancial.com/"&gt;insurance broker TaiAn&lt;/a&gt; for Nguyen’s wife and children and administered by the &lt;a href="https://www.imglobal.com/"&gt;International Medical Group&lt;/a&gt;, does not cover immunizations. And, initially, the family was not offered assistance under the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt;, a federally funded effort, created after a measles outbreak more than 30 years ago, that provides free immunizations for uninsured and underinsured children.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;So the family was exposed to the sticker shock of U.S. medical care without insurance, with providers setting prices. In this case, UTMB’s price for the child’s MMRV shot was about $1,400, more than five times what the CDC says it costs in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nguyen was surprised when their insurer did not pay anything, leaving bills for his three children’s checkups that, combined, were close to $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He said the family’s income, from his job in UTMB’s labs, is less than $57,000 a year. Nguyen’s job provides him health insurance, but he balked at the $615 a month it would cost to cover his family, too, and instead purchased the one-year policy from TaiAn, which totaled $1,841. The policy covers certain types of office visits, emergency room care, hospitalization, and chemotherapy, but not immunizations or checkups.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nguyen and his wife, who are from Vietnam, are living in the country on temporary visas while he completes his studies. In Vietnam, Nguyen said, the total cost of the preventive care his family received at the clinic would probably be no more than $300.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He was concerned about the high prices set by the clinic for the vaccines, particularly during a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s insane,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Carly Kessler, a spokesperson for International Medical Group, confirmed in an email to KFF Health News that the family’s plan does not cover preventive care, including immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After UTMB was contacted by KFF Health News, its vice president of clinical contracting strategies, Kent Pickering, looked into the matter. “This situation should not have happened” but did so because of “a series of errors,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most insurance offered in the U.S. must cover, without copays, a variety of preventive care services — including the measles vaccine — under &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/"&gt;rules in the Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;. But some plans are exempt from those rules, including short-term plans or travel insurance. International students on temporary visas do not have to buy an ACA-compliant plan during their first five years in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But what about the cost of the vaccines?&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hospitals and other providers may set their own prices for services, creating price lists called chargemasters. Insurers negotiate discounts for services they agree to cover. People with no insurance coverage are generally on the hook for the full amount.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“One of the most frustrating parts of our health care system is that people who don’t have health insurance coverage have to pay far more than even a health insurance company would pay,” said Stacie Dusetzina, a professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While prices can vary, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program price list&lt;/a&gt; shows the MMRV vaccine — also known by the brand name ProQuad — costs about $278 in the private sector. Consumer prices for ProQuad at Galveston-area pharmacies range from about $285 to $326, according to the prescription cost-tracking website GoodRx.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;UTMB’s Pickering told KFF Health News that, initially, the Nguyen family’s insurance was entered incorrectly by the clinic staff, so they did not pick up that his plan didn’t cover vaccines. If they had, UTMB likely would have checked whether the Texas Vaccines for Children Program would cover the cost of the shots, charging only the program’s small administration fee.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A second error was uncovered when Pickering looked into the bill. He said UTMB’s chargemaster had been updated a few months earlier and the vaccine prices for those who do not receive shots through the children’s vaccine program were listed at incorrectly high amounts, resulting in the price Nguyen’s son was charged.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Pickering said the prices had been corrected, though he declined to cite exact figures.&lt;/p&gt;

          Because of gaps in their insurance coverage and what an official with the health provider described as billing errors by the primary care clinic, the Nguyen family of Galveston, Texas, ended up owing nearly $5,000 for checkups and immunizations for their three children. That included about $1,400 for an MMRV vaccine for 4-year-old Anh Hoang, administered amid the ongoing measles outbreak.
        &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;h3 id="5c30eb82-cf5c-4829-9a63-5045a99bf6a6" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In addition to contacting the insurer, Nguyen reached out to the financial offices at UTMB, asking for a reduction or waiver of the fees.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In mid-May, UTMB sent Nguyen a revised bill for his son’s office visit. It applied a 50% self-pay discount, which its website says is offered to those who are uninsured. His revised total was $1,266, $711 of which was for the MMRV vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I expected them to waive the vaccination cost for my children or at least reduce it more, especially for MMRV vaccine,” said Nguyen, noting that his family would still be strapped trying to pay their bills.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After Pickering spoke with KFF Health News, a customer service representative reached out to Nguyen, waiving the cost of the vaccines. His new bill was $202.75 for his son’s office visit, as well as similarly smaller amounts for his daughters’ medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="1d4e8942-cf80-4533-84e1-74660558fe43" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Medical billing experts say it’s always a good idea to check with your insurer before elective treatments like checkups or vaccinations to find out what is covered and how much you might owe.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;International students and others who purchase non-ACA-compliant plans, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/short-term-health-plan-surprise-billing-7k-colonoscopy-bill-of-the-month-march-2025/"&gt;such as short-term coverage&lt;/a&gt;, should carefully review their benefits, because there are often limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For some services, including vaccinations, there may be lower-cost options.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Constance Almendarez, the immunization manager for the Galveston County Health District, said in an email that many public health departments, including Galveston’s, offer free vaccinations through the children’s vaccine program to those 18 and under who are eligible, including people without insurance or whose insurance does not cover vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But those programs &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/vaccine-clinics-canceled-measles-surge-federal-funding-cuts/"&gt;are potentially threatened&lt;/a&gt; as the Trump administration institutes layoffs of federal workers and moves to cancel grants to health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Finally, you can ask for a discount. Medical providers may offer self-pay discounts for patients who are uninsured or underinsured, or charity care policies to those who meet specified income requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, the steps you can take to prevent infection are straightforward and effective, like dumping standing water and wearing repellant, especially at dawn and dusk. We want to make sure people know what to do, and do it now.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;When the health department finds a positive sample, the Technical Environmental Services team is in charge of contacting residents in the neighborhood so they can protect themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is West Nile virus?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne illness that can create a wide range of symptoms for people who are infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The incubation period for the virus is normally between two to six days, but can be two to 14 days for some people, Cincinnati Health Department says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;About 70% to 80% of those infected will not show symptoms. One in five people infected may develop the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Headache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Body aches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joint pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vomiting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While most people make a complete recovery, less than 1% of those infected may develop a serious neurologic illness, such as meningitis. Symptoms of neurologic illness include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Headache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High fever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neck stiffness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disorientation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tremors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seizures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paralysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Recovery from a serious case could take several weeks or even months, and even then, some neurologic effects may become permanent, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Additionally, about 10% of people who develop severe symptoms due to West Nile virus will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Although it’s the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the U.S., the Cincinnati Health Department says there is no vaccine for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to protect yourself against West Nile virus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;May through September is considered “mosquito season,” and although populations increase during these warmer months, there are ways people can protect themselves, according to the Cincinnati Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limit outdoor activity at dusk and dawn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wear light colors, loose-fitting pants, long sleeves and shoes with socks outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use mosquito repellant, specifically &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents"&gt;EPA-approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid stagnant water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Repair/replace torn screens along home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use BTi (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) briquettes in standing water that can’t be drained. People can find this at hardware stores. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can pets get West Nile virus?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While cats and dogs can get West Nile virus, they are less likely to become seriously ill or die compared to humans and horses, the health department tells FOX19 NOW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Birds, including pet birds, are also susceptible to the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there a way to prevent mosquitoes from breeding?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, even if the amount of water is very small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The health department encourages people to get rid of these potential breeding sites and sources of standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Ways residents can do this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clean gutters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Empty out kiddie pools and turn them over to dry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;For larger pools, keep the water circulating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Replace water in bird baths and outdoor pet dishes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“If there are ponds or larger areas of water collecting on a property that will not drain, ‘mosquito dunks’ are safe products that will kill mosquito larva and prevent them from becoming mosquitoes,” health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Has West Nile virus ever been detected in Cincinnati?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The health department reported 24 West Nile virus mosquito pools in 2024, which was “far above the average of six pools in the past 10 years.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;However, there were no reports that a person was infected that year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The last time a Cincinnati resident was diagnosed with a West Nile infection was in 2015, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please click here to report it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

&lt;p&gt;Two men were left riddled with parasitic worms after they received infected kidney transplants at two U.S. hospitals, a new case report reveals.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two kidneys had come from the same organ donor, who had resided in the Caribbean before death, according to the report, published June 18 in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the two kidney recipients, a 61-year-old man, had undergone transplant surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital (MassGen). Ten weeks after receiving the transplant, he was transferred back to MassGen after an initial admission to a different hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had developed nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, abdominal discomfort, back pain and a fever. At the first hospital, doctors found fluid building up in his lungs, and the man began breathing quickly, feeling as though he couldn't get enough air, and his oxygen levels dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he entered respiratory failure and shock — meaning he had dangerously low blood pressure — he was transferred to the intensive care unit of MassGen, where doctors documented a purple rash, like a constellation of bruises, spreading across the skin of his stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors began an extensive investigation into the patient's medical history and ran a battery of tests to pinpoint the cause of his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 scary parasitic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xiobYnRD9vYBSnqmmhKNri" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xiobYnRD9vYBSnqmmhKNri slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was on immunosuppressive medications to prevent his body from rejecting his new kidney, making him more susceptible to infections. The medical team, including infectious disease and organ transplant expert &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17244/camille-kotton" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/17244/camille-kotton" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Camille Kotton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had the challenge of whittling down a lengthy list of possible infections to find the most likely cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could rule out bacterial infections, because the man had been given antibiotics and wasn't improving. He was also taking an antiviral and had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. That left some kind of parasite as a likely culprit. This was backed up by the fact that levels of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a type of white blood cell that fights parasitic infections, had also spiked in the man's blood. These cells can also spike due to drug reactions or transplant rejection, but those causes were unlikely given the man's symptoms, Kotton noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A photograph obtained on admission to the intensive care unit shows a purple rash on the man's abdomen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: The New England Journal of Medicine ©2025)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kotton &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005911/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37005911/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;had heard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575239/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23575239/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;of cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which transplanted organs infected their recipients with a small roundworm called &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/em&gt;. She contacted New England Donor Services, a regional organ-procurement organization, about the potential contamination. Although the kidney donor was deceased, they were able to test a vial of the donor's blood, which had antibodies for &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt;, meaning the donor's immune system had at some point encountered the worm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests of the patient's blood samples showed that he did not have antibodies to &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt; before the transplant, but he did afterward. When the medical team sampled various sites across the man's body, they found that the worms had spread far and wide, invading his abdomen, lungs and skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Panels A through C of this figure show worm larvae found in clinical samples from the MassGen patient.

U.S. doctors cannot use organs from people with certain active infections, such as tuberculosis, and donated organs are tested for infectious diseases, but these tests don't always catch everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review noted 13 proven or probable &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt; infections over a decade, accounting for 42% of all parasitic infections transmitted by organ transplants. Prior to this review, fewer than 1 in 4 organ transplant organizations regularly screened for &lt;em&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/em&gt;, but in 2023, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hrsa.unos.org/media/gwvejhen/optn_dtac_endemics_bp_june2023.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://hrsa.unos.org/media/gwvejhen/optn_dtac_endemics_bp_june2023.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network called for universal testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for this parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MassGen medical team treated the man with ivermectin, a powerful antiparasitic drug. They received special permission to administer the drug directly underneath his skin to combat the full body infection, which ultimately cured him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other medical centers that had transplanted organs from the same deceased donor were notified. This flagged a 66-year-old man who was being treated at Albany Medical Center for fatigue, low white blood cells and worsening kidney function following a transplant operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing notes with the MassGen team, the doctors were able to successfully treat this second patient, who had received the donor's other kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organ transplants save lives," a spokesperson for Albany Medical Center told Live Science in an email. "In rare cases like this, the communication and coordination between our hospitals and the involvement of infectious disease physicians at both hospitals was critically important, as was the alert our regional organ procurement organization provided us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Science have contacted MassGen for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep could forestall the declines in brain health that can eventually lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166354" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study of 62 older, cognitively healthy adults, researchers from the University of California (UC) Berkeley, Stanford University, and UC Irvine in the US found individuals with brain changes associated with Alzheimer's performed better on memory function tests as they got more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was irrespective of education and physical activity, two factors along with social connection known to contribute to cognitive resilience in older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with similar Alzheimer's-linked changes who failed to get as much deep sleep didn't fare quite as well on the same tests. &lt;span&gt;By comparison, sleep made little difference to those individuals with few deposits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results, which were published in May 2023, imply having a generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the following video for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of deep sleep almost like a life raft that keeps memory afloat, rather than memory getting dragged down by the weight of Alzheimer's disease pathology," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of California (UC) Berkeley neuroscientist Matthew Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is especially exciting because we can do something about it. There are ways we can improve sleep, even in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143047" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Older lady sleeping " class="size-full wp-image-143047" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/DeepSleepAlzheimersOlderPerson_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143047" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A generous amount of solid shut-eye could help support the decline in memory that sets in as dementia begins to take hold.

Likewise, clumpy amyloid-beta proteins might only be a sign of Alzheimer's disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;not its root cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-compound-in-rosemary-could-help-fight-alzheimers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A Hidden Compound in Rosemary Could Help Fight Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, levels of amyloid-beta proteins are commonly used as a marker of Alzheimer's disease, as research suggests they – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-find-biological-changes-visible-up-to-30-years-before-alzheimer-s-symptoms-appear"&gt;another protein called tau&lt;/a&gt; – can start clogging up brain cells decades before symptoms of the disease arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research from Walker's group found significant levels of amyloid-beta aggregating in the brains of older adults can disrupt deep sleep – also known as non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep – and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4035"&gt;impair memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some folk appear to stave off the decline that comes with Alzheimer's disease, even when levels of amyloid-beta proteins are relatively high. To find out why, Walker and colleagues monitored participants' brain waves as they slept, and then asked them to complete a memory test the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those whose brain scans revealed similarly high levels of beta-amyloid deposits, getting a good night's sleep seemed to make a critical difference in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect was only seen when the researchers looked specifically at non-rapid eye movement slow wave sleep, and not at other sleep wave frequencies or sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143046" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg" alt="Illustration of Brains " class="size-full wp-image-143046" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-434x415.jpg 434w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GraphicOfDeepSleepAndMemory-600x574.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143046" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In people with similar amounts of beta-amyloid protein deposits, more deep sleep corresponded with improved memory function.

It also points to sleep quality being important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a certain level of brain pathology, you're not destined for cognitive symptoms or memory issues," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UC Berkeley neuroscientist and lead author Zsófia Zavecz &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of the study findings in 2023.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although people may display molecular changes indicating a progression toward Alzheimer's disease, Zavecz says their findings suggest lifestyle factors can help buffer against those effects. "One of those factors is sleep and, specifically, deep sleep," she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, though small, also hints at why getting good sleep naturally might be a better option than taking sleeping pills to get some shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other research shows users of sleeping pills &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sleeping-pill-may-reduce-the-build-up-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;appear to have lower levels of amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; in their cerebrospinal fluid, which washes the brain clean at night. But these medications come with side effects; they may also lull people into shallow bouts of sleep rather than deep sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, to set yourself up for a good night's sleep, Zavecz suggests cutting out  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="166354" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; late in the day, doing some exercise, avoiding screen time, and taking a hot shower before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you snooze, rest assured scientists are working hard to figure out the knotty problems of Alzheimer's disease, which affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02811-z"&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in May 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The study found that axonal boutons—sites where neurons form connections—had reduced turnover in Alzheimer’s mice, indicating impaired brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a single rTMS session, the turnover of one bouton type significantly increased, matching levels seen in healthy mice. These changes suggest that rTMS can partially reverse synaptic deficits, potentially improving brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic Turnover Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; rTMS increased turnover of terminaux boutons by up to 213% in AD mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Only terminaux boutons, not en passant boutons, responded to rTMS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; rTMS restored impaired synaptic plasticity to near-healthy levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SPIE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition that affects a significant proportion of older people worldwide. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synapses are points of communication between neural cells that are malleable to change based on our experiences.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In AD, synaptic plasticity, the brain’s ability to regulate the strength of synaptic connections between neurons, is significantly disrupted. This worsens over time, reducing cognitive and memory functions leading to reduced quality of life. To date, there is no effective cure for AD, and only limited treatments for managing the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that uses electromagnetic pulses to target specific brain regions, has therapeutic potential to manage dementia and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From previous studies, we know that rTMS can promote synaptic plasticity in healthy nervous systems. Moreover, it is already used to treat certain neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. However, individual responses to rTMS for AD management are variable, and the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers from the University of Queensland (Australia) and the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre at the University of Tasmania investigated the effects of rTMS on synapses in the brain cortex of mice with Alzheimer’s type dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their report is published in &lt;em&gt;Neurophotonics&lt;/em&gt;. “Since synaptic dysfunction is a key mechanism in AD, in this study, we quantified the changes in synaptic axonal boutons in AD mouse model in response to rTMS, comparing them to those in healthy mice,” explains corresponding author Dr. Barbora Fulopova, a professor at University of Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axonal boutons are specialized endings of an axon, which is the long slender part of a neuron that connects neurons by transmitting neural signals. These are sites where synapses form, allowing neurons to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, any change in the number or function of these boutons can have profound effects on brain connectivity. In this study, the researchers observed structural changes of two types of excitatory boutons&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;namely “terminaux boutons” (TBs) (short protrusions from the axon shaft typically connecting neurons in a local area) and “en passant boutons” (EPBs) (small bead-like structures along axons typically connecting distal regions). They used two-photon imaging to visualize individual axons and synapses in the brain of a live animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted on the APP/PS1 xThy-1GFP-M strain of mice, which is a cross between the APP/PS1 strain (genetically modified to show AD-like symptoms seen in humans) and the Thy1-GFP-M strain, which expresses a fluorescent protein in certain neurons. This combination causes axons to glow during imaging, enabling precise tracking of synaptic bouton changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team monitored the dynamics of the axonal boutons in these mice at 48-hour intervals for eight days, both before and after a single rTMS session. They then compared these findings to healthy wild-type (WT) mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that both TBs and EPBs in the AD mouse model had comparable density to those in healthy WT mice. However, the turnover of both bouton types was significantly lower in the AD mouse model before rTMS, likely due to the amyloid plaque buildup, a key marker of dementia, and potentially causing diseases like AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a single session of low-intensity rTMS, the turnover of TBs in both strains increased significantly, while there was no change in the EPB turnover. Notably, the largest changes were observed two days after stimulation with an 88 percent increase in TB turnover for the WT strain and a 213 percent increase in the APP-GFP strain. However, this increase returned to pre-stimulation levels by the eighth day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in the AD mouse model, this increased turnover was comparable to the turnover levels in the WT mice seen before stimulation. This indicates that low-intensity rTMS can potentially restore the synaptic plasticity of TBs to those seen in healthy mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the fact that only TBs, and not EPBs, responded to rTMS points to the possibility that the mechanisms of rTMS might be cell-type specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first study to provide evidence of pre-synaptic boutons responding to rTMS in a healthy nervous system as well as a nervous system marked by the presence of dementia,” remarks Fulopova.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the established link between synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in dementia and the use of rTMS for the treatment of other neurodegenerative conditions, our findings highlight its potential as a powerful addition to currently used AD management strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study marks a significant step forward in understanding AD. While further research is required, the findings of this study pave the way for targeted rTMS treatments that could improve the quality of life of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain stimulation and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbbfbab5bebeafa89ba8abb2bef5b4a9bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Daneet Steffens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spie.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SPIE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Daneet Steffens – SPIE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.NPh.12.S1.S14613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increases synaptic plasticity of cortical axons in the APP/PS1 amyloidosis mouse model&lt;/a&gt;” by Barbora Fulopova et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurophotonics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation increases synaptic plasticity of cortical axons in the APP/PS1 amyloidosis mouse model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Significance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ID0EH"&gt;Growing evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in diseases causing dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Although its efficacy hasn't yet been tested in humans, the compound could bypass&lt;span&gt; some of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;harmful side-effects&lt;/a&gt; associated with similar drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the famous family of &lt;span&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs, this new candidate targets the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-2_adrenergic_receptor"&gt;β2-adrenergic receptor&lt;/a&gt; (β2AR). Drugs that do this aren't new:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salbutamol"&gt;salbutamol&lt;/a&gt; (sold as Ventolin among other brand names) is widely prescribed for use in short stints to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenbuterol"&gt;Clenbuterol&lt;/a&gt; is also prescribed for asthma in some countries, though it's better known as a performance-enhancing drug, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2165/11537540-000000000-00000"&gt;banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; for its anabolic effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more than a decade, scientists have been trying to find a way to harness the benefits of β2AR agonists, without setting off their harmful effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They&lt;/span&gt; can stimulate skeletal muscle glucose uptake and burn fat, mimicking the effects of exercise – but they have been considered &lt;span&gt;too risky for treating diabetes or obesity, because of their tendency to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24851-beta-agonist"&gt;wreak havoc on the heart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-weight-loss-strategy-is-5x-more-effective-than-ozempic-trials-show?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;One Weight Loss Strategy Is 5x More Effective Than Ozempic, Trials Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The body's β2-adrenergic receptors are coupled with G proteins, and when activated for long periods (by β2AR drugs, for instance), &lt;span&gt;the G proteins set off a chain reaction which leads to cardiovascular problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Ideally, it should be closer to between your shoulder blades than sitting on your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d3cc7" class="body-graf"&gt;For your first walk, Linkul recommends a time-based goal, like walking out for 10 minutes and back for 10 minutes. He suggests doing that three times a week and increasing the time gradually as you get more comfortable with rucking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98a216" class="body-graf"&gt;If going outside isn't an option for you, rucking on a treadmill is a great alternative.

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are protein bars actually healthy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re marketed as nutritious snacks that can give you a boost of protein, vitamins and fiber when you’re on the go. But there are many protein bars on the market, and they’re not all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some protein bars are made from whole-food ingredients such as nuts, fruits, oats and seeds. Others contain so much sugar, fat and artificial additives that they can seem like glorified candy bars, said Julia Zumpano, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some top-selling protein bars contain emulsifiers and synthetic preservatives — such as &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6"&gt;polysorbate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6"&gt;carboxymethyl cellulose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590883/"&gt;butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9003278/"&gt;sodium benzoate&lt;/a&gt; — that have been linked to gut inflammation and various health problems. At the same time, plenty of protein bars are laden with artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes such as erythritol, sucralose and acesulfame potassium that have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10822749/"&gt;associated with a heightened risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you find the healthiest options, we analyzed hundreds of protein bars and interviewed dietitians and nutrition experts. They said that whenever possible, you should always prioritize getting your protein from real food, such as plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, nuts and sliced turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s fine to have a protein bar several times a week for convenience, said Zumpano, especially if the alternative is junk food. “I would rather someone choose a protein bar over a bag of chips from a vending machine,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you should avoid when choosing protein bars — and better ingredients and brands to seek out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Avoid these red flags&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive amounts of added sugar: It’s OK to eat protein bars that are lightly sweetened with such things as dates and honey, especially if you exercise, said Amy Stephens, a sports dietitian at New York University. Carbohydrates replenish your body’s glycogen stores and help your body use protein to build muscle, she added. But you should avoid bars that are loaded with added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, look for bars that have an added sugar content that is less than half the total amount of carbs, Stephens said. If a bar has 20 grams of carbs, for example, then it should contain less than 10 grams of added sugar. If it has more than that, it’s best to find another option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fake” sugars: Don’t be duped by bars that claim they have little or no sugar. In many cases, these bars are made with artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes. “If a protein bar has one gram of sugar but it’s loaded with artificial sweeteners then I would not consider that healthier than a protein bar that has just a little honey or dates in it for sweetness,” said Zumpano at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of sugar you’d be cutting from your diet is likely minimal anyway, and research suggests that sugar substitutes may have surprising side effects. Some have been linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, said Allison Sylvetsky, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. “That raises the question of whether they really are helpful or not,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common sugar substitutes in protein bars include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Sugar alcohols such as erythritol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Artificial sweeteners such as sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame potassium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• “Natural” sweeteners such as stevia, allulose and monk fruit extract. These low and no-calorie sweeteners are derived from plants, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re better for you, Sylvetsky said. “There’s a consumer perception that they’re healthier because they’re from plants,” she added. “But there’s not much evidence to support that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to pick a healthier protein bar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High quality protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Look for proteins such as egg whites and dairy, which may be listed as casein or whey protein. “These contain all the essential amino acids that your body can’t make and that you need for muscle growth,” Stephens said. If you’re vegan, look for plant proteins like soy and pea protein. “These are also great sources of protein,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least 10 grams of protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose bars that have between 10 and 20 grams of protein. “That’s a decent amount,” Zumpano said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating fiber helps keep you full and satiated, and it nourishes your gut microbiome. Look for bars that have about 3 to 5 grams of fiber per serving, Zumpano said. But the more the better. “If a bar has more than 5 grams of fiber, that’s great,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole food ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose bars that are made from “real food” ingredients such as oats, seeds, egg whites, dates, almonds and peanuts. “The ingredients should be things that you can pronounce and recognize,” Stephens said. “If you’re not really sure what an ingredient is, it’s likely something that’s highly processed and that might not be good for your health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The healthiest protein bars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aloha.com/collections/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aloha protein bars:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These bars are relatively low in sugar, high in fiber and have a good amount of protein. Most of the bars have 14 grams of protein and in some cases as much as 10 grams of fiber. That’s roughly a third of the recommended daily fiber intake for adults. The bars are made with mostly simple ingredients, such as almonds, rolled oats, brown rice protein, cashew butter and chocolate chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ingredients are awesome, and the bars are plant-based,” Stephens said. They’re available in at least 21 flavors, including almond butter cup, blueberry, chocolate caramel pecan, and chocolate chip cookie dough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.trubar.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoprIJf2ehASiwZ7cVYORz5YXs15YhZrkAPugUsFlYDwAo2-K97j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUBAR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; These bars contain 12 grams of protein and large amounts of fiber — up to 14 grams per bar, which is about half your recommended daily amount of fiber. They’re relatively low in added sugars compared to other bars, and they’re not artificially sweetened. They contain a blend of plant proteins along with such things as almonds, organic coconut and unsweetened chocolate, and tapioca fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/protein-bars.html"&gt;RXBAR:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;These protein bars are a favorite among dietitians because they’re made from just a handful of simple ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen, such as dates, egg whites, nuts, coconut and other dried fruit. They contain 12 grams of protein, four to six grams of fiber, and 14 to 17 grams of sugar. While these bars are generally on the sweeter side, their sugar content comes from the dates and other dried fruits — not from table sugar, corn syrup or other added sugars. “These bars can be great in the afternoon for a quick snack,” Stephens said. “I like them because they have a moderate amount of protein and ingredients that you can recognize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good option are &lt;a href="https://shop.rxbar.com/shop/minis-variety-pack-1680840075.html"&gt;RXBAR Minis&lt;/a&gt;, which contain about half the calories and total sugar of the regular RXBARs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://allrealnutrition.com/products/ultimate-pack"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Real protein bars:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Each bar contains 12 or fewer ingredients, including grass-fed milk protein. They also have more protein – 16 grams – than a lot of other bars we analyzed. They’re high in fiber and contain little or no added sugar, and they’re made from real-food ingredients such as peanuts, dates, almonds, cocoa, chicory fiber and coconut. They’re available in nine flavors, and they come in plastic-free packaging, including compostable wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;

(Rey Lopez / For The Washington Post)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/"&gt;GoMacro:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These vegan protein bars contain a lot of nutritious whole-food ingredients, such as organic almond butter, organic rolled oats, organic sunflower seed butter, and a blend of organic plant proteins. They’re slightly sweeter than some other protein bars, with around 7 to 13 grams of added sugar per bar. But they also have a decent amount of protein (10 to 12 grams) and fiber (2 to 3 grams) per bar. They’re available in 15 flavors, and they’re gluten-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend their &lt;a href="https://www.gomacro.com/shop/protein-bars/white-chocolate-macadamia-nuts/"&gt;“Celestial Delight” protein bar&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with white chocolate and macadamia nuts. It has one of the best nutrition profiles of any GoMacro bar, with 12 grams of protein, 7 grams of added sugar and 2 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://88acres.com/collections/protein-bars"&gt;88 Acres protein bars:&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The main ingredient in these bars is pumpkin seeds. But they contain a lot of other wholesome ingredients, including sunflower seeds, cherries, bananas, dark chocolate and cinnamon. Each bar has 12 grams of protein, and they come in a variety of flavors, such as banana bread, dark chocolate brownie and chocolate chip blondie. They’re also allergy-friendly: They’re vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and made without wheat, soy, eggs and other top allergens, making them a good choice for people with food allergies and sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bars"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic Bars:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Most protein bars are sweet. But these Paleo-friendly Epic bars are a good choice for people who want a savory option that’s not plant-based. They’re made from a handful of whole-food ingredients such as bison, pork, grass-fed beef and venison, along with a variety of spices and seasonings. They’re slightly lower in protein than other bars — ranging from about 7 to 13 grams of protein per bar — but they’re also fairly low in fat, sugar and calories, Stephens said. One caveat is that some of the flavors are high in sodium. We recommend the &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/bisonbaconcranberrybar"&gt;Bison Bacon Cranberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/best-sellers/products/beefaplebaconbar"&gt;Beef Uncured Bacon + Apple bars&lt;/a&gt;, which are among the flavors that are lowest in sodium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other good protein options from Epic are their &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/bites/products/salmon-maple-coconut-oil-bites"&gt;“salmon bites”&lt;/a&gt; made from wild Alaskan salmon, and their &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips"&gt;“snack strips”&lt;/a&gt; made from &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/wagyu-beef-steak-strips"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://epicprovisions.com/collections/snack-strips/products/smoked-salmon-maple-fillet-strips"&gt;wild salmon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars"&gt;Picky Bar protein bars:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Picky Bar company was founded by a group of professional endurance athletes. Their protein bars contain a mixture of plant proteins, healthy fats and complex carbs thanks to such ingredients as nut butters, dried fruit, oats and seeds. Their protein bars have 10 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 2 to 6 grams of added sugar. They also fit a variety of dietary restrictions: They’re vegan and gluten, dairy and soy-free. They come in two flavors: &lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars/products/apple-cinnawin"&gt;“Apple Cinnawin”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pickybars.com/collections/nut-butter-bars/products/peanut-chocolate-champ"&gt;“Peanut Chocolate Champ.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The data showed a sharp rise, since 2020, in Americans reporting serious difficulty remembering, concentrating or making decisions, which are among the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Moments earlier, my colleague had presented a graph with a nearly identical curve – this one tracking the steep increase in adult stimulant prescriptions since 2020. By 2023, CDC data had confirmed that a record &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;7.8 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of American adults reported an ADHD diagnosis. Google searches for ‘ADHD’ surged, and TikTok videos tagged #ADHD had racked up more than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20 billion&lt;/span&gt; views. At the very most, we could be experiencing an adult ADHD epidemic in the United States. At the very least, ADHD was now suddenly very fashionable to the public. Yet, a third explanation is also possible – for better or worse, the ADHD diagnostic category might be becoming more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can adults develop ADHD? Let’s examine the possibility of an adult ADHD epidemic. This option could be possible only if adult-onset ADHD were a valid phenomenon. ADHD is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder in the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;), a handbook published by the American Psychiatric Association to govern responsible diagnosis of mental disorders by healthcare practitioners. The neurodevelopmental disorder category (which also includes intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder) is characterised by disrupted brain functioning stemming from abnormal neural development. ADHD is largely inherited through a person’s genes but also influenced by environmental factors such as stressors and protective supports. As the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; defines neurodevelopmental disorders, onset is in childhood, but the course usually lasts a lifetime. In the case of ADHD, the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; requires onset of at least some symptoms – difficulties in self-regulation such as attention problems, hyperactivity, mental restlessness and impulsivity – by &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;age 12.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;’s description, research suggests that ADHD is a chronic and lifelong experience for most with the diagnosis. Studies investigating the possibility of true adult-onset ADHD have largely &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-021-01159-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;come up&lt;/a&gt; empty handed. So, what explains rising rates of adult ADHD in the US over the past five years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor may be that the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; has become more inclusive. In 2013, the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; was revised to its fifth edition with several changes that formally relaxed ADHD’s diagnostic criteria. However, it is unclear what impact these changes had on future diagnostic rates. &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pushed the age of onset cutoff from seven to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;12 years&lt;/span&gt; old, reduced the number of symptoms needed (from six to five) for an adult ADHD diagnosis, loosened the level of impairment (problems in daily life functioning) needed for diagnosis, and allowed individuals with autism spectrum disorder to receive a co-occurring ADHD diagnosis. Ultimately, by expanding the diagnostic category, these changes could have increased rates of ADHD diagnosis in adults and children. However, the revision happened in 2013, so it seems unlikely to have triggered the sudden spike in adult ADHD diagnoses in the 2020s. Still, relaxing the adult ADHD criteria in 2013 may have been one source of kindling for the 2020s’ later explosive trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; portrays ADHD as a disorder you either have or have not, ADHD is actually a false binary – comprised of symptoms that appear across a range. Indeed, the diagnosis of ADHD demonstrates a condition that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17995483/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;represents&lt;/a&gt; the extreme end of a trait continuum (like hypertension or obesity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers often use a checklist of behaviours which, in aggregate, form a person’s level of ‘trait ADHD’. Everyone falls somewhere on this continuum, which includes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a person’s abilities in areas such as paying attention, organising tasks, remembering daily activities, and modulating their verbal and motor activity levels. People with very low trait ADHD do very well with most of the behaviours on the checklist. People with high trait ADHD will struggle with many of them. If a person describes above-average ability on the checklist, we call it a strength. When someone has below average ability, we call it a weakness or a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trait ADHD displays a bell curve in the US population and providers must decide where to draw the line between weakness and clinical diagnosis. Formally, the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; offers a symptom cutoff for adults – at least five of nine formal symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Yet, ADHD-symptoms are common and relatable – in fact, the average US adult &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ijcp.13260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; two to three. How severe is enough to deem a symptom present? Conventional clinical wisdom advises that when a person can’t manage in everyday life because of many prominent and chronic ADHD symptoms, an ADHD diagnosis is appropriate. Yet, inevitably, clinicians encounter a grey area when individuals present with mild ADHD weaknesses and no obvious struggles in daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;aking an adult ADHD diagnosis can be done with confidence in someone like Jake*, a 26-year-old I first met when he was a visibly hyperactive third-grader. If Jake walked into a mental health clinic seeking evaluation for adult ADHD, he could share clear stories from his childhood as an athletic but severely bullied child who received special help at school due to disabling problems focusing and completing schoolwork. His highly invested parents could corroborate Jake’s account with their own struggles wrestling with him over personal hygiene and sacrificing their free time to provide Jake the academic support needed to eke across the high-school finish line. As a young adult still living at home, he appears friendless, withdrawn, and immersed in his video games. Though it took him six years, he completed a bachelor’s degree in education, hoping to become a teacher. But with inconsistent motivation to engage in an employment search and challenges with social interactions, he has been working at the local zoo’s ticket counter. Since Jake does not have a car (he totalled the last two and could not afford a new one), his father drops him off each morning on his way to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake’s impairments due to his ADHD would be obvious to a clinician. He has experienced many negative consequences because of chronic, elevated trait ADHD, and these consequences reduce and interfere with his daily life functioning. Like Jake, adults with ADHD experience a range of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-024-00495-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt; that can include employment instability, educational under-attainment, strained relationships with family members, limited social relationships, driving and safety incidents, and challenges managing a household. They also can experience hidden psychological impairments with self-esteem, stress response, anxiety/self-doubt, and feeling disconnected from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, healthcare providers are meeting with patients who come in complaining of a lighter form of ADHD. When Rebecca* walked into a clinic for a possible first-time ADHD diagnosis, she was 41. It had not occurred to her that she might have ADHD until Facebook ads started popping up on her feed during the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; pandemic. One said: ‘Working hard but not moving up? You might have undiagnosed ADHD.’ Another said: ‘Indecisive? Anxious? A two-minute quiz can tell you if you have ADHD.’ One day, her curiosity got the better of her, and she clicked on an image. Looking back on the past &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20-plus&lt;/span&gt; years of her adult life, she wondered whether a diagnosis of ADHD would explain some of the struggles and disappointments she had experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Rebecca’s clinician might feel stuck on whether to make this borderline diagnosis of ADHD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notable to Rebecca was her lack of success in the dating department. Sure, she had a serious boyfriend of four years who was a great, laid-back guy. He owned the house they lived in together and had a successful job. He was eight years younger and, like her, saw the prospect of children as a ball and chain to be avoided. Prior to this relationship, though, she had been devastated by two broken-off engagements and one long-term partnership in which she had been cheated on for years. Her entire social circle had known it was happening, but no one had said anything. Rebecca processed these experiences as personal failures that were her fault, though she could not quite explain what she had done wrong. She had many, many close friends and was gifted at several hobbies, including surfing and pottery – her pieces showed in local galleries and were a dependable income source. Nonetheless, Rebecca felt that she was not the full package. It was not just intimate relationships that had been a source of emotional pain for her. Although Rebecca had graduated from a topnotch college with honours studying industrial design, she had bounced between jobs over the years, chronically indecisive about whether she preferred to work for herself or someone else. As a talented jack-of-all-trades, she could easily pick up work in several different arenas, but ultimately found these endeavours curtailed by the temptation to take off to work and travel abroad for months. Now, in midlife, she was questioning the life decisions that had left her living paycheck to paycheck, with no savings or assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca would be a much more challenging diagnostic scenario for clinicians than Jake. With no obvious childhood history of ADHD symptoms, some might dismiss the possibility of ADHD immediately. Yet, Rebecca reports a moderate amount of relationship and employment instability, as well as financial impacts of her life decisions, paired with persistent feelings of self-blame and self-doubt. These negative experiences can be linked to a pattern of restlessness (a form of mental hyperactivity) in her life, but she reports only three symptoms of inattention and two symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity on an ADHD checklist – not enough for a diagnosis. Rebecca’s clinician might feel stuck on whether to make this borderline diagnosis of ADHD. Yet, performing the due diligence of interviewing her boyfriend, Rebecca’s clinician becomes a bit more confident. The boyfriend describes forgetfulness, difficulties with follow-through on household tasks, talkativeness, and distractibility that are just ‘a part of who &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;she is’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the clinician evaluating Rebecca returns as his anchor to the question of whether her symptoms are interfering with her functioning, and decides to make the diagnosis. But, just as easily, another clinician could dismiss Rebecca’s ‘ADHD-Light’ as subclinical (not severe enough for diagnosis), noting that the symptoms are not substantially interfering with her daily life and that her childhood history of ADHD is inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, like Rebecca, sit in a grey area of the ADHD bell curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before dismissing Rebecca’s ADHD entirely, let’s consider the defensible argument for treating adults with light or what practitioners call ‘subclinical’ ADHD. First, many go on to experience full ADHD at another point in their life – so helping Rebecca now (with an evidence-based approach like cognitive-behavioural therapy or a low dose of medication) could be viewed as a form of prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that subclinical ADHD is not always associated with ADHD’s signature cognitive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239562030056X?casa_token=-2fHo6Pv2aYAAAAA:zjQMUNMYPHoYO7bLXvj5jMqhsNJ4ZvWZmyttWUBk-1PFXmrqTE5-XQMp7dl574eWtRoQEwhG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;differences&lt;/a&gt; like executive function difficulties, and is less likely to be associated with a family &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.10.1720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of the disorder. Individuals with subclinical ADHD often do not experience meaningful impairments or co-occurring diagnoses and are more likely to notice benefits like creativity from their ADHD than people with moderate to severe ADHD. Yet, compared with the general population, they are at elevated risk for secondary complications from their ADHD symptoms – such as substance use &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10550490601082767?casa_token=gdxOUpW_a-oAAAAA:JnqB-1ViBzqGwm9fTbiCLvWrH8dOV95ybN6JwIShCSFP4qo2qEBKXUPOrGD2JM-Tj_y1f9JmpCY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disorders&lt;/a&gt;. They also appear to respond to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/17/6/961/692761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; in similar ways to individuals meeting full ADHD criteria. So, if Rebecca’s provider thought she could benefit from treatment, they might make the diagnosis to qualify her for care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;ne factor that may be nudging subthreshold and mild ADHD patients, like Rebecca, into clinics is the emerging neurodiversity movement. Diagnosed with ADHD, Rebecca feels she is seeing her life clearly for the first time, and experiences meaningful relief with treatment. This transformational experience, felt by many late-diagnosed ‘ADHD-Light’ adults, is calling into question the historical rigidity of ADHD’s diagnostic requirements. The argument is that people like Rebecca – who might not meet ADHD’s traditional impairment and childhood onset criteria – should not be denied the opportunity to hold a diagnosis that feels true to their identity and resonates with their lived experiences. This framing is part and parcel of the neurodiversity movement, whose ideas caught fire in the ADHD community during the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; pandemic. The neurodiversity framework encourages a more inclusive definition of adult ADHD as a fundamentally disabling neurotype, regardless of one’s external impairment level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinician adhering to the neurodiversity conceptualisation of ADHD might consider the concepts of masking (camouflaging ADHD symptoms to assimilate to social norms) and compensating (employing strategies that mitigate the impact of symptoms on daily life) when forming diagnostic conclusions. Ultimately, they might override the need to demonstrate objective impairment or childhood symptoms if they can point to identifiable masking or compensatory factors that prevented their emergence. The neurodiversity movement also raises questions about whether the exhaustion from constantly suppressing one’s ADHD can supplant the impairment criterion. Interestingly, many common mental disorders in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have a ‘distress and/or impairment’ criterion for establishing clinically sufficient severity, but ADHD employs only an impairment criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca’s clinician might point to her intelligence and sought-after talents as strengths that masked her childhood symptoms and allowed her to compensate for ADHD as an adult. If she had not been so good at school and so charismatic in her personality, perhaps ADHD traits would have visibly emerged in childhood. If she had not had multiple monetisable skills, and a boyfriend providing free housing, her prominent restlessness could have become a serious threat to her financial survival. Even Jake found ways to offset his ADHD with help from his parents – what would his life be like today if they had not pushed him through his education, given him a stable place to live, and provided him with reliable transportation? Still, if a person is a sum of their parts, then it’s also defensible to take a holistic view of ADHD – that Rebecca is a person whose net impairment level is not that meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The 2020s have witnessed a powerful great awakening of women who came to identify with ADHD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several pandemic-related factors may have also contributed to the tug-of-war over ADHD’s diagnostic borders. As Americans began to spend more time online, many people increasingly shared their diverse lived experiences with ADHD. An explosion of ADHD anecdotes shared on social media posts may or may not have &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; with scientifically validated information about the disorder but certainly stretched the public’s conceptualisation of ADHD’s many faces. Because novel rather than tried-and-true information garners the most social media clicks, a long list of ‘secret’ or ‘unrecognised’ crowdsourced ADHD symptoms began to proliferate online. As this list grew, so did the number of people who found the ADHD diagnosis to be relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the #ADHD world also created some money-making opportunities. Many ADHD posts touting lived experience linked directly to purchasable products or services such as supplements or coaching. Most notably, several large-scale digital startups seized an opportunity in the midst of relaxed US laws for prescribing stimulant&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; (the main class of medications for ADHD), and began offering quick and easy online diagnoses to support their economy-of-scale business models. They unleashed a sea of digital ads upon their potential consumers (like the post that caught Rebecca’s eye). These ads also may have influenced self-referral rates for ADHD – through a digital startup or otherwise. It is worth noting that a few ADHD-centric prescribing companies (like &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/telehealth-company-cerebral-agrees-pay-over-36-million-connection-business-practices#:~:text=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cerebral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/founderceo-and-clinical-president-digital-health-company-arrested-100m-adderall-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Done&lt;/a&gt;) later fell under federal investigation for predatory practices and subsequently folded their ADHD-prescribing operations. At the very least, we can say that the internet had developed a vested interest in expanding the definition of who could benefit from ADHD products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing women’s movement within the ADHD community may also be increasing self-referrals for ADHD diagnoses. As the CDC and other sources &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/php/adults/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reveal&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of adults seeking diagnosis and treatment for the first time are women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. The 2020s have witnessed a powerful great awakening of women who came to identify with the ADHD diagnosis for the first time by sharing lived experiences with one another online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge of women makes sense. It is well established that ADHD historically has been diagnosed at lower rates in girls than boys. Because research on ADHD has historically excluded girls, we do not fully know if this trend reflects a structural inequity, later-onset of ADHD in girls and women (perhaps influenced by hormonal factors), or a lower prevalence of girls and women at the extreme end of the ADHD-trait distribution (perhaps due to protective &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X2400275X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt; of being biologically female on the expression of ADHD genetic risks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Emerging research has revealed that ADHD can be highly unstable across an individual’s lifespan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a grassroots fashion, the ADHD women’s movement is mobilising around the sentiment that women with ADHD were missed &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;en masse&lt;/span&gt; during childhood due to diagnostic criteria that favour men and boys. One action item of this ADHD advocacy &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/improve-gender-equity-in-the-diagnosis-of-adult-adhd-petition-to-apsard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; is a push to expand the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; criteria to better address the clinical presentations of women with ADHD. The diagnostic implications of the women’s movement within ADHD are complex, and women are indisputably expanding definitions of what ADHD can look like. These new portraits of women-specific ADHD, and cries of structural inequity, have caught the attention of sympathetic clinicians. However, research has not yet sorted out best practices for identifying ADHD in girls and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD’s recent surge is probably not just a societal change in how we define and recognise the disorder, though. Recent studies reveal that ADHD can wax and wane. Thus, it’s possible that more Americans are experiencing clinically meaningful difficulties with ADHD since the pandemic. Emerging research from the past few years has revealed that, within an individual, ADHD can be highly &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21010032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;unstable&lt;/a&gt; across the lifespan. Many, if not most, individuals with ADHD, will meet formal diagnostic criteria for the disorder during some years but not others. Some research confirms that fluctuations in environmental demands can &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/fluctuating-adhd-multimodal-treatment-of-adhd-mta-study/?trk=public_post_comment-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;influence&lt;/a&gt; the ups and downs of an individual’s ADHD. What’s more, ADHD symptoms can wax and wane even in people &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17030298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of thinking lines up with the idea that genes and environment work together in ADHD. In other words, whether someone’s genetic risk for ADHD shows up in real life can depend on what’s happening around them. So, if certain things in society made ADHD symptoms worse, people who were already on the edge of having ADHD might have started feeling a lot more symptoms all at once – and many may have looked for some kind of support at the same time, whether that meant medication, therapy, coaching or even supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea matches what a large &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10870547231158750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies found: around the world, ADHD symptoms went up during the pandemic. It also fits with the census data I went over with my colleague from the CDC back in Baltimore. So, if ADHD symptoms got worse during the pandemic and people started talking about it more online through #ADHD social media content, it makes sense that more people in the grey area started wondering if they had ADHD. But what actually caused the jump in official diagnoses? One likely reason is the rise of easy-to-access telehealth services, like those offered by online mental health companies. According to a 2024 CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7340a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, about one in five adults with ADHD got their diagnosis using online modalities, and half have used telehealth for ADHD care in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat is a clinician to do? Should a practitioner provide a diagnosis to a usually subclinical individual during a unique period when their ADHD spikes into the clinical zone? Doing so is probably not overdiagnosis since the individual will likely meet all criteria for ADHD (the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; requires &lt;em&gt;several &lt;/em&gt;symptoms to be present since childhood, not the full syndrome). In future years, the broader field will likely recognise ADHD’s fluctuating course across the lifespan and the factors that trigger ADHD flare-ups. The ADHD diagnosis will inevitably become more inclusive as the science of ADHD’s fluctuations translates into clinical practice. Clinicians may be less likely to refuse a diagnosis to people with a form of ADHD that tends to turn off &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;and on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising themselves in the expanding list of relatable, crowdsourced ADHD symptoms, more adults than ever may be self-diagnosing or wondering about possible ADHD. Some may have hopped offline to raise this possibility to their longstanding healthcare providers. Today, providers are faced with increasingly challenging diagnostic dilemmas as patients describe their ADHD as being mostly characterised by popularised, crowdsourced &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;non-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; symptoms such as ‘hyperfocus’, ‘emotional reactivity’, and ‘rejection sensitivity dysphoria’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether adoption of the neurodiversity framework is as widespread among clinicians as it is on social media. However, there is certainly a growing tension between traditional and alternative ways of thinking about ADHD diagnosis within the clinician workforce. The supposition that clinicians must wade through a pit of what-ifs to unearth a largely unimpaired individual’s true ADHD neurotype is a tall order for many. Although an individual’s level of trait ADHD correlates highly with their genetic load for the disorder, there is no definitive biomarker for ADHD. Some people with elevated genetic risk of ADHD do not display the disorder. Other people with ADHD do not demonstrate a strong genetic load. Trait ADHD is influenced by an interplay of complex biological, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Some clinicians fear that the boundaries of ADHD will become too subjective, which will bruise its credibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, ADHD is best conceptualised as a bundle of cognitive subtraits (like working memory, response to rewards, ability to inhibit one’s behaviour) that contribute to an overarching ADHD behavioural trait. People who achieve a high score on an overall trait-ADHD behavioural checklist will show widely varying combinations of these cognitive subtraits. Thus, there are undoubtedly different neurobiological paths to ADHD, and the volume may be turned up or down on those paths based on a range of stable or transient factors. Since ADHD is such a neurocognitively diverse category, there is no objective cognitive test that can reliably confirm the diagnosis. Instead, we clinicians rely on documenting a stable and impairing pattern of observable behaviours consistent with ADHD that are substantiated by multiple individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, there are both vocal advocates and opponents of the neurodiversity framing of ADHD. I have also met open-minded clinicians who feel the neurodiversity framework makes a lot of sense but are hesitant to step away from upholding the strict impairment and childhood-onset criteria. They fear that the boundaries of ADHD will become far too subjective, which will bruise its credibility. They are very protective of a diagnosis that is clearly so disabling to those who meet its strict criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD has always experienced stigma from sceptics in the public and in the broader medical field. For various reasons, similar scrutiny has not been passed on to sister diagnoses like autism spectrum disorder or learning disorder – or spectrum-based medical diagnoses like hypertension or diabetes. Since ADHD traits are on a continuum, and can show up in the general population, the impairment and childhood-onset criteria have acted as important checks and balances. The diagnostic line will inevitably become much blurrier if we kick these checks and balances out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is already vulnerable to misdiagnosis and so affixing an overdiagnosis narrative has always been tempting to those outside the ADHD community. As a standard part of the adult ADHD diagnostic process, clinicians must wade through a complicated process of differential diagnosis (ruling out other suspects) with so-called ADHD ‘mimics’. After all, difficulties with concentration are the second-most common &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37665038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of any disorder in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. There are many non-ADHD-related factors that alter the neurochemical environment of brain structures implicated in ADHD, creating an ADHD mimic (eg, psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression, side-effects of medications taken for reasons unrelated to ADHD, normal responses to stress or poor sleep, endocrine disorders and transitions such as hypothyroidism or perimenopause). Differential diagnosis is often the most time-consuming part of a properly performed adult ADHD diagnostic evaluation. Multiple, long encounters are sometimes needed to confidently complete this process. Modern healthcare systems cannot always accommodate this level of due diligence, which creates a vulnerability to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ut for just as many occasions where ADHD is improperly diagnosed, it also is likely missed. Many adults with ADHD who are late-identified initially come into contact with the mental health system for co-occurring diagnoses such as anxiety, substance use disorders or depression. Often, undiagnosed ADHD is at the root of these secondary complaints, but it is missed by the untrained eye. Thus, for every adult ADHD overdiagnosis there is likely an underdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/span&gt; pandemic created global exacerbations in mental health concerns &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032721010570?casa_token=Z5P4KKzkG48AAAAA:uVW46x4ZEBl94zjm2el0uucXNmvKFnZC9GSJKMjTytI83mENxx_dLgEZ_68yZIt5uZdSm1k2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; and a subsequent influx of people seeking help for ADHD and beyond (eg, the US &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-announces-shortage-adderall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt; of the stimulant Adderall spawned by increased demand for ADHD treatment). This unprecedented demand required an expansion of the provider workforce, which shifted new providers into the task of making first-time adult ADHD diagnoses. It appears that many primary care doctors and nurse practitioners stepped up to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10870547241238899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meet &lt;/a&gt;this need (in addition to the instant-diagnosis digital startups referenced earlier in this article). Newer providers who are first learning to diagnose adult ADHD acknowledge they get some information from popular sources. While they may be more vulnerable than a veteran ADHD specialist to confusing ADHD for a mimic, they may also be more open to inclusive viewpoints on the nature of ADHD in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it time to partition the ADHD diagnosis into separate disorders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Our diagnostic categories need to do a better job of capturing the many faces of ADHD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long understood ADHD as a &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050817-084917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of related disorders that impact self-regulation, making it vulnerable to becoming a catch-all category for anyone with attentional concerns. This diagnostic lumping may be expanding the inclusiveness of the ADHD category and producing diagnostic rates that cause public discomfort. Partitioning, rather than discrediting ADHD, may be a consideration. For example, the past &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;75 years&lt;/span&gt; has witnessed the &lt;em&gt;DSM&lt;/em&gt; partition the previously singular diagnosis of depression into separate categories that include major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Perhaps it is time for it to do the same with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of subdividing ADHD into a broader class of multiple disorders must be done through careful research that examines the full implications of diagnostic changes. The vocabulary surrounding future changes is also important. As with depressive diagnoses, reorganisation of a broader category of disorders of attention and self-regulation might consider severity (is there a lighter form of ADHD that mainly impacts psychological factors?), course (are there female sex-specific versions of ADHD with pubertal or perimenopausal onsets?), persistence and stability (is there ADHD that fluctuates with environmental factors?), and features (is there a form of ADHD that is largely experienced as emotion dysregulation?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical point here is that everyone’s experience of ADHD-like difficulties, and their impacts on how one walks through life, are valid. Our diagnostic categories need to do a better job of capturing the many faces of ADHD and helping patients and clinicians see eye to eye on diagnostic conclusions. Until diverse disorders of attention and self-regulation are properly sorted, ADHD will continue to become more and more inclusive, as additional forms of self-regulation concerns are recognised and pushed into the only diagnostic category available to them. Though we can point to many reasons why diagnostic lumping is problematic, people like Jake and Rebecca still need help, and we want to make sure they can &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that adults 55 and older who drank two to four (European-sized) cups of coffee daily were less likely to become frail over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antioxidants, polyphenols, and bioactive compounds in coffee help reduce inflammation, maintain muscle mass, and improve metabolic health — all of which contribute to preventing age-related frailty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study also found that decaffeinated coffee was associated with a lower risk of frailty, suggesting that non-caffeine components are key; however, adding excessive sugar or heavily sweetened syrups to coffee can cancel out these health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people start their mornings with a cup of coffee because of its soothing taste and the energy boost it provides. But beyond its ability to wake you up on even the dullest mornings, a recent study published in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-025-03683-0?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found habitual coffee consumption may protect you against frailty in old age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study examined the relationship between coffee consumption and the risk of frailty among adults aged 55 and older in the Netherlands. Researchers assessed current and midlife (ages 40 - 65) coffee intake and found that those who drank more than four cups a day were less likely to become frail as they aged, says &lt;a href="https://beverlyhillsconciergedoctor.com/ehsan-ali-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ehsan Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, an internal medicine physician fellowship-trained in geriatric care and founder of Beverly Hills Concierge Doctor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even those who drank two to four cups daily over a seven-year period saw significant benefits, Ali notes. “In simple terms, according to the study, the more coffee people drink (within reason), the lower their chances of developing frailty in later life.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At first glance, more than four daily cups of coffee might seem excessive, but it’s important to note that one cup of coffee in this study is equal to 125 milliliters, or roughly 4.2 fluid ounces. In the United States, a standard cup size is 8 fluid ounces, says &lt;a href="https://bodytosoulhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jennifer Bianchini&lt;/a&gt;, RD, a functional dietitian, mind-body wellness expert, and founder of Body to Soul Health. In other words, when the study mentions four cups of coffee a day, that’s actually closer to two American-sized cups. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, how exactly does coffee protect against age-related frailty? Here’s what experts have to say.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Emerging research suggests that coffee’s protective effects against frailty are likely due to several interconnected factors. Experts emphasize four main ways coffee promotes healthy aging: by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, preserving muscle mass, and improving metabolic function. Here’s a closer look at how each of these factors helps prevent age-related frailty.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which combat oxidative stress (an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants that can lead to cell damage) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5927356/#:~:text=At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20oxidative,%29%2C%20including%20sarcopenia%20and%20frailty." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to aging and frailty, Ali says. Furthermore, when oxidative stress increases, Bianchini says it triggers inflammation, accelerates aging, and increases the risk of chronic disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammation is a &lt;a href="https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-023-00410-3" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;known factor in frailty&lt;/a&gt;, but Ali says the bioactive compounds in coffee may help reduce systemic inflammation. Antioxidants are well-regarded for their anti-inflammatory effects, and the polyphenols in coffee also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6266803/#:~:text=Studies%20of%20plant%20extracts%20and,cardiovascular%20diseases%2C%20among%20other%20conditions." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;help reduce chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, further decreasing the risk of age-related frailty, Bianchini says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1390309/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that coffee may help preserve muscle mass and strength, two vital factors in preventing frailty. “As we age, we lose muscle mass and have an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23167-sarcopenia" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;, the age-related loss of muscle tissue, but coffee intake may possibly slow or prevent the condition,” Bianchini says. This is because coffee’s bioactive compounds &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457722004648" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;support healthy mitochondrial function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037023003355" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;promote cellular renewal&lt;/a&gt;, both of which enhance muscle energy and strength, she explains.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ali says that coffee has been linked to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8066601/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531720304449" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, which can indirectly lower the risk of frailty. Recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11294012/#:~:text=Results,P%20for%20interaction%20%3E0.05%29." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked long-term insulin resistance to frailty, as it causes chronic inflammation, decreases muscle mass, and exacerbates oxidative stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, while the study points to an exciting potential connection between daily coffee consumption and healthy aging, the current findings are observational, meaning they show a relationship but not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, Bianchini says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Beyond its potential role in reducing frailty, moderate coffee consumption is linked to several other health benefits:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improves cognitive function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223802/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; to boost alertness, improve focus, and support overall cognitive function by stimulating the central nervous system. Caffeine also has neuroprotective effects, with regular coffee consumption &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10630722/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, Ali says. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8641656/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; even found that higher coffee intake was connected to slower cognitive decline in executive functioning and attention span.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Enhances athletic performance  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://biomedres.us/fulltexts/BJSTR.MS.ID.007008.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that caffeine may enhance athletic performance by increasing adrenaline, a hormone that prepares the body for stressful or challenging situations. This not only energizes the body, but the heightened adrenaline levels might also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9824573/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;enhance endurance&lt;/a&gt; and reduce the perception of effort, or how hard you feel you’re working.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports longevity  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moderate caffeine consumption has been linked to longevity, with studies &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/17348/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;showing&lt;/a&gt; a connection between coffee drinking and a reduced risk of early death. Specifically, Ali says that regular coffee intake can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1050173821000888?via%3Dihub" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower the risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-021-02411-5" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-10991-7" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;protect against liver condition&lt;/a&gt;s like cirrhosis and liver cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-coffee-should-you-drink-to-reap-these-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How much coffee should you drink to reap these benefits? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee affects everyone differently, so intake varies based on personal tolerance. Bianchini generally recommends one to two regular 8-ounce cups of coffee a day. “For most people, this amount provides plenty of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits,” she explains. “Just remember that in the study, one cup of coffee is equivalent to approximately 4 ounces, which is about half of what we typically call a ‘cup’ in the United States, so if you’re drinking one to two standard U.S. cups (8 ounces per cup) you’re already getting all the benefits you need relative to this study.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most healthy adults, consuming up to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#Footnote" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;400 milligrams of caffeine daily&lt;/a&gt; (about four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee) is generally safe, but too much coffee can cause stomach upset, jitteriness, increased heart rate, anxiety, dehydration, and insomnia, Ali says. Therefore, it’s important to watch your individual tolerance and adjust your intake as needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for the type of coffee, the study specifically examined regular brewed black coffee and its decaffeinated version. “Interestingly, higher decaf coffee intake was associated with a lower risk of frailty, which suggests it’s not just caffeine, but it may be the antioxidants and plant compounds in coffee that matter most,” Bianchini says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, sweetened coffees, blended drinks, or coffee with syrups and whipped cream are not the same thing, so Bianchini says it’s best to drink coffee in its simplest form — black or with a splash of regular or plant-based (additive-free) milk. “When you load coffee with syrups, whipped cream, flavored creamers, sugar, or artificial sweeteners, you completely change the health profile, and those extras spike blood sugar, contribute to inflammation, and cancel out the potential anti-inflammatory benefits of plain coffee,” she says.&lt;br&gt;

A tiny insect called a midge spreads the disease, and the earliest known case &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938780/"&gt;dates back to 1955&lt;/a&gt; in a forest worker near a village called Vega de Oropouche in Trinidad. Since most people who were infected with the virus recovered on their own and since cases were so infrequent, it barely registered as a public health concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a few years ago, something changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A major Oropouche fever outbreak beginning in 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666517425000689?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected at least 23,000 people&lt;/a&gt; across Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Peru. It wasn’t just confined to remote wilderness areas but was spreading in metropolises like &lt;a href="https://www.ioc.fiocruz.br/en/noticias/instituto-confirma-primeiro-diagnostico-de-febre-oropouche-no-rio-de-janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, travelers were infected and then brought the virus home: So far, Oropouche fever has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON545"&gt;sprung up&lt;/a&gt; in the US, Canada, and Europe in people returning from the afflicted region. The outbreak has killed at least five people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The sudden rise of Oropouche disease startled scientists and health officials. Since its discovery, there have only been around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12159208/"&gt;500,000 known cases&lt;/a&gt;. By contrast, there are upward of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue"&gt;400 million dengue infections&lt;/a&gt; each year. It’s likely then that many more Oropouche infections have gone undetected, especially since its symptoms overlap with those from other diseases and there’s little active screening for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="what-youll-learn-from-this-story" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you’ll learn from this story&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What Oropouche fever is, how you can identify it, and what spreads the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What researchers know about the startling outbreak across South American in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The threat the disease’s spread poses to the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, researchers are looking back at the outbreak to try to find out what they missed and what lessons they can apply to get ahead of future epidemics. Oropouche virus is a critical case study in the complicated factors that drive vector-borne diseases. Dynamics like deforestation, urban sprawl, international travel, and gaps in surveillance are converging to drive up the dangers from infections spread by animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And as the climate changes, new regions are becoming more hospitable to the blood suckers that spread these diseases, increasing the chances of these seemingly-remote infections making it to the US and getting established. That means more people will face threats from illnesses that they may never have considered before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s very likely that these public health problems that people before called ‘tropical disease’ are not so tropical anymore and are basically everywhere,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.uky.edu/users/wmde227"&gt;William de Souza&lt;/a&gt;, who studies arboviruses — viruses spread by arthropods like insects — at the University of Kentucky. “Vector-borne disease is not a local problem; this is a global problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The rising specter of Oropouche fever comes at a time when the United States is cutting funding for research at universities, pulling back from studying vector-borne disease threats, and ending &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/"&gt;collaborations with other countries&lt;/a&gt; to limit their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-oropouche-virus-is-a-classic-case-study-in-how-humans-worsen-vector-borne-disease" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The Oropouche virus is a classic case study in how humans worsen vector-borne disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Oropouche virus belongs to the family of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8004/"&gt;bunyaviruses&lt;/a&gt;. They appear as spheres under a microscope, and they encode their genomes in RNA, rather than DNA as human cells do. RNA viruses tend to have &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(08)00055-4"&gt;high mutation rates&lt;/a&gt;, making it harder to target them with vaccines and increasing the odds of reinfection. Oropuche’s relatives include the viruses behind Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, spread by ticks, and Rift Valley fever, spread by mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Oropouche spreads mainly through the bites of a 1- to 3-millimeter-long insect called, appropriately, a biting midge (Culicoides paraensis). Midges are sometimes called sand flies or no-see-ums in the US, and they breed in damp soil, rotting vegetation, and standing water. Like mosquitoes, they feed on blood to drive their reproduction, but their minuscule bodies can easily slip through mosquito nets. When a midge bites an infected host, it can pass on the pathogen to a human during a subsequent bite. There’s also evidence that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article"&gt;virus may be sexually transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/20/g-s1-34891/oropouche-virus-sexual-transmission-brazil"&gt;no such cases have been documented yet&lt;/a&gt;. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that male travelers from regions where Oropouche is spreading &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/prevention/index.html"&gt;should not have sex for six weeks&lt;/a&gt; if they show symptoms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Vector-borne diseases like Oropouche continue to surprise us because there are so many variables that have to align in order to spread them — the pathogens, the vectors, the hosts, and the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unlike diseases like Covid-19 or influenza, vector-borne illnesses don’t spread directly from person to person. Instead, they require an animal, often arthropods like ticks, midges, and mosquitoes. The range, reproduction, and behavior of these organisms add another confounding factor in the spread of the diseases they carry. Globally, vector-borne diseases account for 17 percent of infectious diseases, leading to more than 700,000 deaths per year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. But not every part of the world is equally vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In cooler regions, vector-borne infections are often a minor public health concern, but in countries like Brazil, “it’s at the top,” said &lt;a href="https://climaesaude.icict.fiocruz.br/autores-publicacoes/tatiane-cristina-moraes-de-sousa"&gt;Tatiane Moraes de Sousa&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro. “Oropouche before 2024 was concentrated just in the Amazon. Last year, we saw the spreading of Oropuche in almost all Brazilian states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That gets to the first obstacle in tracking Oropouche: Which animals are the reservoirs for the virus and where are they? So far, researchers have detected the virus in animals including sloths, capuchin monkeys, marmosets, domestic birds, and rodents. These organisms form what’s known as the sylvatic, or forest, cycle of the virus. How the virus jumps between all these animals and which ones are most concerning for people is not known. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, it may be possible that other insects may be able to carry the Oropouche virus, but it’s not clear whether they can spread it to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The pattern that does emerge is that when people spend more time inside and around the fringes of tropical rainforests, where the animals that harbor the virus and the insects that spread them reside, they’re more likely to get infected. With deforestation and development, more people are moving into areas where the disease naturally spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This is a classical example of how human behavior can lead to the emergence of a pathogen,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/62379/tilston-lunel-natasha"&gt;Natasha Tilston&lt;/a&gt;, who studies Oropouche virus at the Indiana University School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;An aerial view of a logging yard in the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Tarcisio Schnaider via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People can travel great distances, and as people move back and forth from the wilderness to cities, they can unwittingly carry viruses like Oropouche. If enough of them gather in cities where vectors are present, they can trigger an urban epidemic cycle as the virus travels from person to midge to person. This was likely the pattern in the 2023–2024 outbreak in major cities in South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s also true that more health workers were on guard for Oropouche and thus identified more infections. “The outbreak is probably a combination of one, there are more cases, and two, we’re also looking for a lot more than we did before,” Tilston said, noting that some past outbreaks of dengue may have actually been Oropouche as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-set-off-the-outbreak" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What set off the outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One factor is that the virus &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03300-3"&gt;likely evolved&lt;/a&gt;. Viruses mutate all the time, and most mutations are either inconsequential or detrimental to the virus, slowing or stopping its reproduction. But occasionally, a change can confer an advantage or make the pathogen more destructive. The Oropouche virus has a genome structure that makes it even more prone to a type of mutation called reassortment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Reassortment is when you have two similar viruses infect the same cell and they mix genomes,” explained University of Kentucky’s de Souza. “People previously infected by the old virus are now susceptible to new infection. This could help explain why the Amazon region, where this has been circulated for a long time, saw this emerge, because people were probably reinfected.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The strain behind the outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00619-4/fulltext"&gt;appears to reproduce faster and cause more severe illness&lt;/a&gt; than prior varieties as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Part of the reason this outbreak racked up so many infected people is that health officials were starting to deploy the tools to identify on a wider scale. Particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, more health departments across the region built up their tools to detect viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But researchers still aren’t sure exactly what spurred the virus to spread so suddenly across so many countries. Travel restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic started relaxing in 2023 and made it easier for people to move back and forth from the rural areas where the virus is endemic to the cities where it became established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The 2023–2024 outbreak also coincided with a &lt;a href="/climate/23992678/el-nino-south-america-peru-bolivia-flood-drought-dengue-cop28-climate"&gt;powerful El Niño event that brought gargantuan amounts of rain&lt;/a&gt; and triggered &lt;a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/el-nino-linked-rains-trigger-devastation-brazil"&gt;unprecedented flooding&lt;/a&gt; across many parts of South America. These were also years that set &lt;a href="/climate/23864998/heat-wave-south-america-brazil-australia-argentina-hemisphere-winter"&gt;new temperature records&lt;/a&gt;. Higher temperatures can speed up the reproduction of the virus inside midges. But scientists aren’t exactly sure how this heat and water affected the vectors, though Brazil has seen &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12030144/"&gt;outbreaks of other infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of floods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“El Niño and other climate phenomena have been associated with the change of the patterns of many different vector-borne diseases,” de Souza said. “For Oropouche specifically, we don’t have the answers yet, but the likelihood of impact is very high.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On top of all this, there aren’t any specific ways to keep an outbreak in check once it ignites. There are no vaccines or treatments for Oropouche fever yet. So when all the factors align to spread the disease, there isn’t much people can do to target the disease, and when it reaches a new area, there aren’t as many people with immunity and few health workers who know what they’re dealing with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A health worker fumigates against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector of the dengue, zika, and Chikungunya viruses in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2024, as the country faced a substantial increase in dengue fever cases. The mosquito species has also been identified as a potential spreader of Oropouche virus, though plays a minor role compared to the biting midge.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Douglas Magno/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-the-us-is-preparing-for-diseases-like-the-oropouche-virus" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How the US is preparing for diseases like the Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Fortunately, the Oropouche outbreak has died down, but a variety of infections are gaining a toehold in new places as infected people travel and as vectors move into new habitats, and the US is increasingly vulnerable. According to the CDC, the number of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vector-borne-diseases/php/data-research/national-strategy/index.html"&gt;vector-borne disease cases per year&lt;/a&gt; has doubled in the US since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last year, the US saw transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-eee-eastern-equine-encephalitis-mosquito-borne-virus-symptoms/"&gt;Eastern equine encephalitis &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2024/08/28/maryland-confirms-1st-2024-human-west-nile-virus-case-how-to-fight-it/74967082007/"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt;. Malaria, a disease once eradicated across the country, saw the first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00494.html"&gt;local infections&lt;/a&gt; in 20 years in 2023 in Florida and Texas. Vectors like the &lt;a href="https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/ent-87"&gt;Asian tiger mosquito&lt;/a&gt; are spreading further north as the climate changes and expands favorable conditions for its survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With travelers moving back and forth from regions where diseases are endemic, many will unwittingly bring back dangerous souvenirs, whether a stowaway insect in their luggage or an infection in their blood. And with midges, mosquitoes, and ticks spreading to new regions, dangerous pathogens are extending their reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are ways to slow the spread of these diseases, however, and the US has managed to do so before. The US famously launched a successful campaign to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.html"&gt;eradicate malaria&lt;/a&gt; within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The first step is to simply acknowledge the threat. As Oropouche showed, there may be diseases lurking closer than we realized that we simply haven’t bothered to look for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s fairly simple to do things like dump standing water where insects can breed or spray insecticides on midge breeding grounds. But some places are getting creative, working to build up habitats for fish, bats, birds, and dragonflies that are &lt;a href="https://www.wbrparish.org/394/Natural-Mosquito-Predators"&gt;natural predators&lt;/a&gt; of mosquitoes and midges to limit their spread. Limiting the destruction and development in wilderness areas can reduce the likelihood of diseases spilling over from animals into humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some regions are looking at even more drastic ways to stymie vectors. One measure that’s gaining traction is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/irradiated-mosquitoes.html"&gt;deploying sterile male mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;. When they mate, they produce eggs that won’t hatch, thus reducing the population of the insect. Brazil recently inaugurated a factory that breeds mosquitoes to carry a bacterium known as Wolbachia that prevents the mosquitoes from reproducing easily, slowing the viruses that cause dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, a disease that can cause fever and joint pain, now established in the Americas. Hawaii is using these mosquitoes to &lt;a href="/down-to-earth/416699/hawaii-endangered-species-birds-mosquitoes"&gt;arrest the spread of avian malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Vaccines and treatments are critical tools for addressing the diseases directly. Many pathogens can be controlled with these measures, but because they more commonly spread in poorer countries, there is less investment in containing them. Many vector-borne diseases like Oropouche are considered “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/neglected-tropical-diseases#tab=tab_1"&gt;neglected&lt;/a&gt;,” and so when they do spread beyond their typical range, there isn’t much available to help those who get sick. But the growing burden of these diseases demands a new generation of tools that can target multiple threats. “We are seeing so many outbreaks that we need broad vaccines,” said Fiocruz’s Sousa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Additionally, vector-borne diseases aren’t each waiting for their turns. Countries can have multiple outbreaks at the same time on top of all the other health concerns that emerge during severe weather like extreme heat or the health care disruptions in the wake of a disaster like a major storm. “We are seeing cumulative threats because we are seeing not just one vector-borne disease,” Sousa said. “In a lot of scenarios, we are also maintaining high levels of communicable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Right now, some health departments are being proactive, keeping an eye out for sick travelers, collecting mosquitoes in the wild to see what kinds of germs they’re carrying, and coordinating with researchers across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’ve been having biweekly meetings with CDC to talk about the potential for Oropouche coming into the US and spreading,” said Bethany Bolling, zoonotic virology group manager at the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We’ve seen in the past that Florida and Texas are some of the primary areas where these new viruses start to establish, so in Texas, we’re trying to be aware of Oropouche and what the vectors are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For the US, Brazil’s experience with Oropouche is an important lesson that could help health officials prepare and counter the disease when it inevitably arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;“There is a real threat to the United States,” Tilston said. “I think we have all the right settings, and I think it’s just a matter of everything being in the right place at the right time. With climate change, it’s just really a matter of when it’s going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQOUZNR0VMM0tCdm0zSVI4SEF5V2lhY3RiTmFiQWZIckRxbmR0a3dENm91RzdYTEpjZWl0cExfN2NDcUVBUWRyaFRxeVllYmhmUG5RYkRxRXpvQ1V3S2xJRkxJUXBPZWp1X0hxNU93MXlsOHBVZFhNcUtQT0QtTGxYa3hyVFRmRFlUS3lpU3pULWlFQWM5</guid></item><item><title>与ChatGPT的亲密关系如何导致男子在警察手中射击- AOL.com | How an Intimate Relationship with ChatGPT Led to a Man's Shooting at the Hands of Police - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE44TmYzclBBRGxkMzZHQUlIRDNTMkNYUXRlbzJ5SkdNcHNWNDBUcEJRak1xU2Z2LV9Ib09TZUV0dEQyWkRBRkNSNnBTX1l5NFJMS2dJSUNHcUNLdUlqX3NhSnBVczZ4X0t5eTRjdlM2Q3ZmeGFYTUxpcGxUMlRodw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Alexander Taylor&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Taylor was shot and killed by police on April 25, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old had gotten into an altercation with his father after he tried to reason with his son, who became distraught for believing an AI chatbot had been killed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor reportedly became infatuated with the AI chatbot and believed it had been killed by the company that created it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent Taylor says he’ll “regret” his final conversation with his son Alexander for the rest of his life.

I held him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as he did, Taylor told WPTV he tried another approach: telling his son bluntly that the AI bot was not real and that it was an “echo chamber.” Alexander punched his father in the face, prompting Taylor to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the police were called, Alexander grabbed a knife from the kitchen and told his father he was going to do something to cause police to shoot and kill him, according to &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;. Taylor called 911 again and warned them his son was mentally ill and had said he planned to commit suicide by cop. The father asked police to bring non-lethal weapons and be prepared to confront his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the officers did not. Alexander waited for police outside the house and when they arrived, he charged at them with a knife. Officers responded by shooting Alexander multiple times in the chest and he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital, WPTV &lt;a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/officer-involved-shooting-investigated-in-port-st-lucie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was no crisis intervention team. There was no de-escalation," Taylor told the outlet earlier this month. "There was no reason for them to approach it as a tactical situation instead of a mental health crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

A spokesperson for the Port St. Lucie Police Department did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shooting has been one of several recent AI-related incidents of violence documented by media outlets like Rolling Stone and &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, among others, highlighting the potential dangers of the budding technology. Taylor told WPTV the technology “has to have guardrails,” though he doesn’t believe his son’s incident and others like it necessarily mean artificial intelligence can’t be used for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Taylor said he even used AI to help write his son’s eulogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had talked to it for a while about what had happened, trying to find more details about exactly what he was going through,” Taylor told &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;. “And it was beautiful and touching. It was like it read my heart and it scared the s— out of me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/how-an-intimate-relationship-with-chatgpt-led-to-a-mans-shooting-at-the-hands-of-police-11763951" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:35:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE44TmYzclBBRGxkMzZHQUlIRDNTMkNYUXRlbzJ5SkdNcHNWNDBUcEJRak1xU2Z2LV9Ib09TZUV0dEQyWkRBRkNSNnBTX1l5NFJMS2dJSUNHcUNLdUlqX3NhSnBVczZ4X0t5eTRjdlM2Q3ZmeGFYTUxpcGxUMlRodw</guid></item><item><title>Michael G.

One of the findings? The worse lactose intolerance symptoms people had, the more &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/why-so-many-people-are-experiencing-weird-pandemic-dreams-n1188901" target="_blank"&gt;intense their nightmares were&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d79e77" class="body-graf"&gt;The study may offer some answers to questions raised by &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00047/full" target="_blank"&gt;research from 2015&lt;/a&gt; that looked at factors that influence “food-dependent dreaming” — in other words, how foods affect dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0d297" class="body-graf"&gt;“In the earlier study, people were blaming cheese all the time for their bad dreams,” said Tore Nielsen, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal who co-authored both studies. “And so I think we got some better answers in the study for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9bd516" class="body-graf"&gt;The study included just over 1,000 participants.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;People who responded that they had severe gastrointestinal symptoms from their &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/extra-charge-non-dairy-milk-discrimination-lawsuit-challenges-dunkin-d-rcna134734" target="_blank"&gt;lactose intolerance&lt;/a&gt; reported stronger nightmares, measured by the frequency of nightmares, the level of distress they caused, how much they impaired daily activities and the duration of the nightmares across months. The participants most commonly blamed their bad dreams on dairy and sweets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f96c0e" class="body-graf"&gt;The participants took the survey as part of an undergraduate introductory psychology class. Because of that, the results may not apply to the wider population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64b250" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, both the researchers and outside experts said there are plausible explanations for why a cheesy meal before bed could lead to bad dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16e4c9" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms of anxiety that might accompany lactose intolerance could be creating more nightmares, Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd90f9" class="body-graf"&gt;Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director at the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beating-insomnia-lower-risk-heart-attack-rcna72016" target="_blank"&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/a&gt; caused by gastrointestinal issues may explain the link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a891cb" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have GI issues, that could account for a lot of what’s happening in terms of your sleep disturbances that could be associated with different dreams,” St-Onge said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ee4180" class="body-graf"&gt;Patrick McNamara, an associate professor of neurology at Boston University Chobanian &amp;amp; Avedisian School of Medicine who studies the brain and sleep, said eating a trigger food for lactose intolerance may cause “micro-arousals” that disturb sleep quality, resulting in stronger nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18818d" class="body-graf"&gt;However, both McNamara and the study authors cautioned that other factors unrelated to gastrointestinal symptoms could play a role, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3da052" class="body-graf"&gt;Nielsen said he wants to see more research done on the link between dairy and dreams. Russell Powell, a co-author of the new study and professor emeritus of psychology at MacEwan University in Alberta, said they plan to try to replicate the findings in other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43b023" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Still, people can look at their own diets and make decisions about aspects to change — interventions that don’t necessarily need the assistance of a medical professional to do, Nielsen added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQbWUxU1J4WGdRekdUVVF3Y3hjYWtpeUFtaktrR0dWZkFEU0prT3ZaaG1OdEYwSS1TTUdLaFYyblltZzRDYTN2UVFYVmFneEpqV0dmVTdwVXFIWnZud0pzT2FCMDlsc2Y4bm1JaGVnNWtZSFR6TGJEVzd3azFheUNxcHYtMHU3TFZ5ZmhWTTNtbTjSAVZBVV95cUxQeUQ0Uk9tdmI3c1ZmV3lWNFFlZ05hZEhydExFb1pzZzh4OE9MTFFIbm5kTkg4Sm91VlVJeEhlN2Y0MGtxM1pIMXVQMUFGOHl1ZTk0NzFYQQ</guid></item><item><title>该MRI可读取您大脑的隐藏时钟，并预测未来几十年的痴呆症- SciTechDaily | This MRI Reads Your Brain’s Hidden Clock and Predicts Dementia Decades Ahead - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOVEZqWFJYbzZiZm9LQ3pSb2RNcDZmYjhYcmxXejRfWG1zb2dLZG5fR1dvYjJYeTl3MTh0VHJOeVhUTHJ4RGUzZC0yZGFFYlpiOWo5dnJIbVdiZWtwNXByN0xDMlN4b1llQ09Xa0F5YkdNUG8xZjFsM0hCVzNneFdteGxvSE9kakZuQUY3bGZLM3FMTUpnSXZ2dWpHMnBUcVMzN1lJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:59:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOVEZqWFJYbzZiZm9LQ3pSb2RNcDZmYjhYcmxXejRfWG1zb2dLZG5fR1dvYjJYeTl3MTh0VHJOeVhUTHJ4RGUzZC0yZGFFYlpiOWo5dnJIbVdiZWtwNXByN0xDMlN4b1llQ09Xa0F5YkdNUG8xZjFsM0hCVzNneFdteGxvSE9kakZuQUY3bGZLM3FMTUpnSXZ2dWpHMnBUcVMzN1lJ</guid></item><item><title>您的大脑如何在您知道之前做出决定- Earth.com | How your brain makes a decision before you know it - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTGc3QXdjOTBGcXQyVzI4WGw1Qk4wbGFYdlFDNHQxNVhYVHMwanljU0pyR0UtSm5mckdHNUVCMk1TalhaY2NwQVhPUXE2WEZObi1CU2lTcjZ6NHdubUUzLW9VQzQ1RGozN1czb29tVkhsNFd4TWJ2bTRrVzhCcFVRYjRqdV8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you make a decision, your brain is already busy. It starts pulling in evidence, thinking through options, and slowly leaning toward a choice – all without you even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a simple situation: two drivers in rush hour traffic. They both see the same congested road. One hits the gas to merge. The other taps the brakes and waits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same scene, different reaction. Why? That’s a question that scientists have been trying to answer for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decision-making-in-the-brain"&gt;Decision-making in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.princeton.edu/"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;, working with teams from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Stanford University, and Boston University, may be closer to cracking the code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was focused on how individual brain cells – each with its own quirks – somehow work together to land on a decision. In particular, the team investigated the dorsal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/two-distinct-maps-discovered-in-the-brain/"&gt;premotor cortex&lt;/a&gt; – a part of the brain that helps turn decisions into actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we choose to reach, move, or act, the dorsal premotor cortex is in play. But it’s not as simple as one neuron equals one thought. The activity here is all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-structure-of-rhesus-macaques-is-shaped-by-social-interactions/"&gt;rhesus macaques&lt;/a&gt; to look at a checkered screen and figure out whether red or green was more dominant. Sometimes the answer was obvious, while other times it was tough to call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-from-individual-neurons"&gt;Signals from individual neurons &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the monkeys made their choices, the scientists recorded signals from individual neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that even during the same trial, the neurons didn’t behave in sync. The monkeys showed a wide range of responses, something scientists call “heterogeneity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tatiana Engel, an associate professor at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, is the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread assumption is that this heterogeneity reflects the complex dynamics involved in cognition,” said Dr. Engel. “But surprisingly, we found that this apparent complexity arises from a very different neural coding principle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-neurons-work-together-for-a-decision"&gt;Neurons work together for a decision &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a new type of computational model to help explain this complexity. It revealed that a neuron’s behavior is shaped by two key factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is tuning – when a neuron responds and what kind of decision it reacts to. The second is neural dynamics – how the brain’s internal state influences that activity as it unfolds over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a rolling landscape. In this model, valleys represent stable decisions. As &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-complete-map-of-every-neuron-in-the-brain-revealed/"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; activate, their patterns move like a ball rolling down a hill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On steeper slopes (easier choices), the ball moves quickly toward a clear answer. On flatter ground (harder decisions), the ball wobbles more, making mistakes more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-coordinated-journey-in-the-brain"&gt;A coordinated journey in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team compared this model to real brain data, it held up. The tuning stayed the same no matter how easy or hard the task was, but the shape of the mental terrain shifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift helped explain why neurons that look random on the surface are actually following the same deeper logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like a group of skiers descending a mountain,” explained Dr. Engel. “Each prefers a slightly different path, but all are shaped by the same slope beneath them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Similarly, each neuron has its own preference and activity, but the group of cells collectively in the premotor cortex takes a coordinated journey and gradually settles into a stable state that represents the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters-beyond-the-lab"&gt;Why this matters beyond the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study helps decode how the brain works when we’re weighing choices, especially the tricky ones. That kind of insight is crucial – not just for understanding everyday decision-making, but for understanding mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/schizophrenia-linked-to-irregular-fatty-metabolism-in-the-brain/"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-fructose-intake-may-contribute-to-bipolar-disorder-and-aggression/"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, decision-making can be disrupted. Knowing how neurons usually coordinate could help pinpoint what’s going wrong. It also opens the door to designing more targeted therapies that focus on decision-related brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team isn’t done yet. Their next step is to dig deeper into the roles of different types of neurons and how their connections shape this internal landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every decision is unique,” said Dr. Engel. “But by digging down to the level of single trials and single neurons, we can start to make sense of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09199-1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 08:23:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNTGc3QXdjOTBGcXQyVzI4WGw1Qk4wbGFYdlFDNHQxNVhYVHMwanljU0pyR0UtSm5mckdHNUVCMk1TalhaY2NwQVhPUXE2WEZObi1CU2lTcjZ6NHdubUUzLW9VQzQ1RGozN1czb29tVkhsNFd4TWJ2bTRrVzhCcFVRYjRqdV8</guid></item><item><title>神经病学家分享了5个有效的提示，以促进大脑健康和降低痴呆风险-印度时报 | Neurologist shares 5 effective tips to boost brain health and reduce dementia risk - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgJBVV95cUxPNHJ0Ykl1M2duT2ktVlN6LUhoM2oxY2Q4RzFmRGFrS3poc1lOWF82UndxcjRHdlc2Q1VFYVY1aFF1NTJuMWMtcFhNdmlPZkg0R1oxV1Q2TldJa0Z2dVpLTjNMb2V1bGhFVHVKalRpSnN1ZjJKZXl6UHhjUnR2aUFYZEhqM3FMZWl6YVpWcmhFcXQ3QWdHbWVQS0tybnRmS296aWVPOG9SRU1lYnFlX0tGT1VyVlVMc2pYVmt0RWNoRmN6cWVJTmFmRXNQNVZOcnc2bE13ZGwtN1dsa25vWE1qdnRud3BvUlhaUjZVWnV5eVkyQ3loeEw1My1XSUE2M3R0ekVDVThBLW8ydVYyRGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity workouts aren’t necessary to reap brain health benefits. Something as simple as a walk can boost brain health. Schott absolutely vouches for the brain-boosting effects of walking. He stresses the importance of going on walks every day. “Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually a relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-230740" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;found that walking can boost brain function. They found that even moderate levels of physical activity, such as taking fewer than 4,000 steps a day, can have a positive effect on brain health. “This is much less than the often-suggested 10,000 steps, making it a more achievable goal for many people. Our research links regular physical activity to larger brain volumes, suggesting neuroprotective benefits. This large sample study furthers our understanding of lifestyle factors in brain health and dementia prevention,” the researchers said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 07:30:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgJBVV95cUxPNHJ0Ykl1M2duT2ktVlN6LUhoM2oxY2Q4RzFmRGFrS3poc1lOWF82UndxcjRHdlc2Q1VFYVY1aFF1NTJuMWMtcFhNdmlPZkg0R1oxV1Q2TldJa0Z2dVpLTjNMb2V1bGhFVHVKalRpSnN1ZjJKZXl6UHhjUnR2aUFYZEhqM3FMZWl6YVpWcmhFcXQ3QWdHbWVQS0tybnRmS296aWVPOG9SRU1lYnFlX0tGT1VyVlVMc2pYVmt0RWNoRmN6cWVJTmFmRXNQNVZOcnc2bE13ZGwtN1dsa25vWE1qdnRud3BvUlhaUjZVWnV5eVkyQ3loeEw1My1XSUE2M3R0ekVDVThBLW8ydVYyRGc</guid></item><item><title>2型糖尿病：模仿禁食的饮食与降低血糖有关- MedicalNewsToday | Type 2 diabetes: Fasting-mimicking diet linked to lower blood sugar - MedicalNewsToday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQdDktSG5iQVJZMWhMbXZZWFlEYlhCZkFtMVV4OTdWcUV2VHNEdlctX3BOVE9rTFlKN1pNTFFBdTNmNTI0U2FUbXN5MjI0NVVnMUhmU3lHeXV5MFpLS1lPRm5MbmZ4SlhJVXdZNzk2UDdmbE9TU1RLdklMTlJueWtQMzFyekpoVFNPRGl4LVJJQVNfS2VWTnBNQ2VTSHg4MmZSV1VuUVVKTDJ5TkNhN3ZibjlkUFA3SldY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="calendar page with eighth day circled in red" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fa-fasting-mimicking-diet-may-improve-blood-sugar-control-in-type-2-diabetes&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Fcalendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Type%202%20diabetes%3A%20Fasting-mimicking%20diet%20linked%20to%20lower%20blood%20sugar" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/calendar-circled-date-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;A 5-day fasting-mimicking diet may improve blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes, according to a new trial.

Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and increased physical activity, help lower blood glucose levels and facilitate weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medications such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/metformin-oral-tablet" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/glp-1-receptor-agonists-type-2-diabetes" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt; facilitate the management of diabetes symptoms, only lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications, can lead to disease remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30852132/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; that restricting daily calorie intake is effective in managing blood sugar levels and reducing weight in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, adhering to such a diet over the long term is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the body adapts to long-term calorie restriction, resulting in a slower metabolism, which makes sustained weight loss more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, various forms of fasting diets, involving alternating periods of fasting and unrestricted food intake, have been suggested to be easier to adhere to while alleviating diabetes symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fasting triggers a stress response in cells and the body, promoting healthy aging by reducing inflammation and oxidative damage, while enhancing metabolism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting diets may involve either restricting calorie intake during certain hours of the day, known as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/intermittent-fasting-is-it-all-its-cracked-up-to-be" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, or during specific days of the week or month, referred to as periodic fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11153305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fasting-mimicking diet&lt;/a&gt; is a form of periodic fasting that involves restricted calorie intake for 4 to 7 consecutive days per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed the fasting mimicking diet to simulate the beneficial health effects of water-only fasting, which involves only water intake during a 24 to 72-hour period. In contrast to water-only fasting, a fasting-mimicking diet allows for limited calorie intake during the fasting period, making adherence less challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the current study have developed a patented low-calorie, plant-based diet that is low in sugar and protein, but rich in healthy unsaturated fats and fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A previous study demonstrated that a 5-day fasting-mimicking diet also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6816332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;leads&lt;/a&gt; to a decrease in blood sugar and insulin levels, while increasing the levels of ketone bodies. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11153305/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that a 5-day fasting mimicking diet combined with medications was more effective than medications alone in improving blood glucose control and reducing medication reliance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results were observed under highly controlled conditions in a clinical trial, including strict criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion.

The fasting-mimicking diet also helped a greater percentage of participants achieve blood glucose control at these time points than at the time of enrolment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fasting-mimicking diet also reduced reliance on medications for blood glucose control, while still resulting in high levels of engagement in the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Most participants are able to integrate the fasting-mimicking diet into their daily lives without significant disruption.

The program is designed to prioritize safety while expanding access to innovative nutrition-based care for metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Routhenstein advised that “the inclusion of lifestyle advice with the option to consult a dietitian may have influenced some of the study findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 06:06:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQdDktSG5iQVJZMWhMbXZZWFlEYlhCZkFtMVV4OTdWcUV2VHNEdlctX3BOVE9rTFlKN1pNTFFBdTNmNTI0U2FUbXN5MjI0NVVnMUhmU3lHeXV5MFpLS1lPRm5MbmZ4SlhJVXdZNzk2UDdmbE9TU1RLdklMTlJueWtQMzFyekpoVFNPRGl4LVJJQVNfS2VWTnBNQ2VTSHg4MmZSV1VuUVVKTDJ5TkNhN3ZibjlkUFA3SldY</guid></item><item><title>心脏病发作不再是美国的主要死因以下是相反的情况- AOL.com | Heart Attacks No Longer a Leading Cause of Death in the U.S. Here's What Is Instead - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1vYmhERzdPcm9MSVVMYUluNlhiRWpaTjlhOWtVc28wVWlvdXEyRndMMUg2ajRkZkg1MzFoN0JnTE8xRFM1eGJwUGIyUks0SXUyb3ZuQTNGYkEtaUc1WlNRRE9Wclp3c245THdDSVhfZW5GOWxV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Heart disease overall has decreased by 66% since 1970, but it remains the leading cause of death among Americans.

Ischemic heart disease was responsible for 91% of all heart disease-related deaths in 1970, declining to 53% by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease overall has decreased by 66% since 1970, yet it remains the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leading cause of death among Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leading cause of death among Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more people avoiding death from myocardial infarctions (MI), fatalities from other heart disease subtypes now represent 81% of heart-related deaths.

Morgan wasn’t involved in the new report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not note a decline in myocardial infarctions themselves, but rather a decline in heart attacks being the primary cause of death,” she said. “As Americans, we are not that great at prevention. Our strength has been in the science and application of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The inference is that more and more heart attacks are survivable now as compared to 55 years ago,” Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because emergency physicians have become better at saving people experiencing heart attacks with the help of contemporary medications, lifesaving procedures, and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deaths from non-fatal heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan explained that the non-fatal heart attack “was the catalyst for the chain of events leading to eventual long-term chronic heart disease conditions such as heart failure and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:arrhythmias;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients who otherwise would have passed from their heart attack are now surviving, and then living longer dealing with the consequences,” &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cheng-Han Chen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board certified interventional cardiologist, told Healthline. Chen wasn’t involved in the new report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen described heart-muscle damage that non-fatal heart attacks often leave in their wake. The extent of that damage depends on the severity and duration of the attack. Weakness in the heart muscle can result in heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that heart failure does not mean that a heart has completely failed. Rather, it means that it is no longer functioning as well as it once did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart failure is a spectrum in which the heart just doesn’t work perfectly,” said Chen. “It could be very mild, or it could be very severe and everything in-between.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can actually live with mild heart failure for the remainder of your life,” said Chen, “and it doesn’t really affect you that much, and you can control it with medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another obvious result of non-fatal heart attacks is that people who survive them tend to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure, hypertension-related heart disease, and arrhythmia are all associated with aging. Living longer only increases the odds of eventually developing these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors impact heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typical American lifestyle puts many people at a high risk for heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmia, Morgan noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is characterized, she said, by “&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/heart-disease-and-obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-sitting-is-bad-for-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sedentary lifestyles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sedentary lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, processed and palatable fast food, decreased physical movement, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes, as well as societal stressors leading to chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted that socioeconomic issues complicate lifestyle risk factors and make addressing them especially difficult for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This includes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/complications-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pregnancy complications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pregnancy complications&lt;/a&gt; such as hypertension of pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pre-eclampsia-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:preeclampsia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;preeclampsia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gestational-diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gestational diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, etc.,” Morgan added. “These all increase a woman’s lifetime &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/causes-risks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and are still the primary drivers of maternal mortality outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general decline in heart fatalities, however, indicates that some progress is being made against some of these risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sharp increase in arrhythmia-related deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found the most dramatic increase in arrhythmia-related deaths. &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Arrhythmias;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Arrhythmias&lt;/a&gt; are disorders in which the rate at which the heart beats is abnormal. There are four main types of arrhythmia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;bradycardia — slow heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;tachycardia — fast heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ventricular arrhythmia — begins in the ventricles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;supraventricular arrhythmia — begins above the ventricles (i.e., &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/living-with-atrial-fibrillation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:atrial fibrillation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; or irregular heartbeat)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrhythmias are common and are often harmless. However, should an arrhythmia interfere with the heart’s ability to maintain blood flow, damage may occur to the heart, brain, lungs, and other vital organs. As the report describes, arrhythmias can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to get annual checkups that include a heart-health examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you can feel your heart is beating without having your hand on your chest, it is a good idea to consult your doctor to be checked for arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially essential for heart-attack survivors. “Reducing the risk of arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction is crucial, as these &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/abnormal-heart-rhythms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irregular heart rhythms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irregular heart rhythms&lt;/a&gt; — especially ventricular arrhythmias — can be life threatening,” Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cited several interventions that can help the survivor of a non-fatal heart attack avoid death from arrhythmia, including a four-drug combo known as the “foundational four” for managing HFrEF (&lt;a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/61" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan said statins, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-attack/physical-therapy-after-heart-attack" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiac rehab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiac rehab&lt;/a&gt;, implantable &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arrhythmia/defibrillator-vs-pacemaker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:defibrillators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;defibrillators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/atrial-fibrillation/sleep-apnea-and-afib" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; management, and lifestyle changes may also be valuable in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AHA’s tips for staying heart-healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association (AHA) provides an eight-step framework for maintaining heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit the AHA’s &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Essential Eight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Essential Eight&lt;/a&gt; website.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most experts say no—&lt;strong&gt;you should still keep taking the “sunshine vitamin.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body naturally produces vitamin D when exposed to direct sunlight, but it still may not be enough to make up for the deficit from the winter months, &lt;a href="https://www.barenholtzlevy.com/bio.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hedva Barenholtz Levy, PharmD&lt;/a&gt;, a pharmacist specializing in geriatrics, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A healthcare provider should adjust the dose and frequency of your vitamin D supplements based on your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d-test-8712026" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D levels from blood test results&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some fatty fish, like trout and salmon, have vitamin D, along with some UV-treated mushrooms. Fortified foods like milk, juices, and ready-to-eat cereals can also contain vitamin D.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It is possible to take too much vitamin D through supplements. Though rare, &lt;strong&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/strong&gt; can occur because your body stores it rather than getting rid of any excess.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Too much vitamin D in your blood may cause problems like high calcium levels, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.health.com/kidney-failure-overview-7488917" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;, heart arrhythmias, and even death, according to Hernandez.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D toxicity is usually accompanied by:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body can produce enough vitamin D from the sun during the warmer months, but you may often come into the season deficient, especially if you are older than 65, have darker skin, live in a northern climate, and practice good sun protection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To determine how much vitamin D you should be taking during the summer, talk with a healthcare provider. They can check your vitamin D levels and make recommendations on how much you should take daily.&lt;br&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Has a late-night cheese session ever seemed to send you down your own personal &lt;em&gt;Nightmare on Elm Street&lt;/em&gt;? You’re probably not alone. Research out today has revealed a link between lactose intolerance and a higher risk of bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Canada conducted the study by surveying college students. People who reported having regular nightmares and poorer sleep in general were also more likely to report having food allergies, including lactose intolerance, they found. The researchers speculate that the distress caused by people’s stomach issues can seep into our non-waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The results we obtained confirmed our hypothesis that lactose intolerance is indeed predictive of disturbed dreaming and nightmares,” study co-author Russ Powell, a psychologist and professor emeritus at MacEwan University in Edmonton, Alberta, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea that the foods we eat, particularly cheese or other dairy products, can worsen our sleep is hardly new. In the early 1900s, for example, American cartoonist Winsor McCay created a popular newspaper comic strip—&lt;em&gt;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&lt;/em&gt;—that routinely featured people getting nightmares or strange dreams after eating something less than agreeable. Often, this trigger food was a &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Welsh-rarebit"&gt;Welsh rarebit&lt;/a&gt;, a popular British dish of cheese on toast.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But according to Powell, this phenomenon hasn’t really been studied much scientifically. A decade ago, this same team published a survey finding that roughly 20% of participants &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25741294/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; having bizarre dreams they felt were connected to eating certain foods or eating late at night, with many blaming dairy products specifically. In their latest study, Powell and his colleagues were hoping to replicate their earlier findings, in addition to digging a bit deeper into the reasons behind people’s cheese-flavored nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers surveyed over 1,000 college students (more than twice the sample size of the 2015 study) about their dietary and sleeping habits. About 40% of respondents felt that some foods or late-night chowing affected their sleep, with 25% feeling their diets worsened their sleep. This time, only 5.5% specifically blamed foods for affecting the content of their dreams, but dairy, spicy foods, and sweets were commonly blamed culprits among those who did. The researchers also found that self-reported lactose intolerance was associated with more severe nightmares and poorer sleep, as were other food allergies. Unsurprisingly, lactose intolerance was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, while people who reported less healthy diets in general tended to have more nightmares and to have more difficulty recalling their dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475/full"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in Frontiers in Psychology (both the current and the 2015 study directly reference &lt;em&gt;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&lt;/em&gt; in their title).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As anyone with lactose intolerance knows, indulging a dairy craving can cause plenty of GI pain and bloating. And the researchers reason that these symptoms can stir people awake or more subtly ruin their dreams—an explanation that might extend to other similar kinds of pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It may be that GI distress, in comparison to other types of physical distress, has a particularly strong impact upon sleeping and dreaming. Menstrual cramping, for example, has also been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11870828/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to increase the likelihood of disturbed dreaming,” Powell said. He further theorizes that since GI symptoms can be caused by ingesting poison, our dairy nightmares might be the body’s way to keep itself alert in case of medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers would like to confirm their research experimentally, such as a trial that directly compares how lactose-intolerant people sleep and dream after either eating or avoiding dairy. Powell believes it would also be interesting to study whether food sensitivities could be directly contributing to some people’s nightmare disorders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/lactose-intolerance/definition-facts"&gt;one-third&lt;/a&gt; of Americans have trouble digesting lactose, though not everyone feels sick after having some. And given how annoying lactose intolerance already is, these findings may offer further incentive to stay away from the late-night dairy. I personally know that I’ll be more likely to reach for a scoop of evening sorbet over the ice cream next time around.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
