&lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., more than 38 million Americans have diabetes (about 1 in 10), of which some 90–95 percent have type 2, in which the body either can't use insulin effectively, or does not produce enough of it to regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide—which is not yet licensed—and dulaglutide both help manage blood sugar levels by acting on the same receptor in the body, known as the GLP-1 receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide targets specific pathways in the body that enhance insulin production and lower blood sugar, while avoiding another pathway that can sometimes reduce the receptor's activity, the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dulaglutide, on the other hand, turns on both pathways the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide demonstrates a better efficacy of weight loss and blood sugar control compared to existing medications in the trials," study author Feifei Jiang told &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 52-week study of more than 600 adults in China with type 2 diabetes, participants who received ecnoglutide saw their average blood sugar drop by about 1.9 percent, compared to a 1.65 percent drop in participants who received dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People taking ecnoglutide also lost nearly twice as much weight as those on dulaglutide, experiencing an average body weight reduction of 5.2–5.7 percent compared to an average weight loss of 2.8 percent for those taking dulaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional weight loss seen in participants taking ecnoglutide could further help diabetes management and reduce risks of heart disease, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on currently available information (primarily from clinical trials), the types of side effects associated with ecnoglutide are expected to be similar to those of existing GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide or dulaglutide), primarily including gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) and decreased appetite. Most cases were mild to moderate side effects and tended to decrease gradually with prolonged treatment," Jiang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecnoglutide is also simpler to produce than other GLP-1 receptor agonists, the study highlights. This means it can be manufactured more quickly and at a lower cost than other weight loss medications currently available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests ecnoglutide could be a valuable new treatment option for people with type 2 diabetes, offering effective blood sugar control and weight loss, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action="Click"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how it comparises to Ozempic, the researchers wrote in the paper: "Ecnoglutide, a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist, is composed entirely of natural amino acids with chemical modifications to enhance stability and activity, differing from semaglutide by four amino acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explained these modifications not only improve how the drug works but the manufacturing process in this case too. Unlike semaglutide, which requires extra chemical steps to attach additional amino acids, ecnoglutide can be made more directly through genetically engineered cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although this study presents a valuable comparison of ecnoglutide with dulaglutide, comparisons with semaglutide are also of clinical interest due to the structural similarity between ecnoglutide and semaglutide, and the greater glycemic and weight-lowering effects reported with semaglutide versus dulaglutide," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, at the time of study conduct, limited availability of semaglutide in China made its inclusion as a comparator unfeasible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers said side-by-side consideration with the Phase &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33074557/" target="_blank" title="3 SUSTAIN-China study" class="multivariate"&gt;3 SUSTAIN-China study&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide might offer some insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although no direct comparison has been conducted, these findings indirectly suggest that their efficacy might be similar. Future head-to-head trials will be required to confirm this," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang explained that SUSTAIN-China showed average blood sugar was reduced by 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks, whereas with ecnoglutide it dropped by 1.89 percent to 1.91 percent after 32 weeks (shown in the separate study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, body weight was reduced by 5.2 percent to 5.7 percent with ecnoglutide after 52 weeks, while it was reduced by 3.9 percent to 5.7 percent with semaglutide after 30 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those results suggest that the efficacy of ecnoglutide might be similar or even better than semaglutide in glycemic control," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are needed to explore ecnoglutide's efficacy across diverse populations and in combination with other antidiabetic agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ecnoglutide has not yet received formal marketing authorization for any indication in any country or region worldwide, in China, new drug applications (NDAs) are under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ecnoglutide is expected to achieve optimal efficacy when combined with behavioral and lifestyle support interventions. Lifestyle guidance like dietary planning and exercise recommendations helps patients establish sustainable healthy habits," said Jiang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Morten Harket (right) from the Norwegian group A-ha recently announced his diagnosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For too long, Parkinson's has been fundamentally misunderstood,' they said. 'The majority of the public, and even many scientists, still view the disease as an inevitable consequence of aging. In their eyes, the disease reflects increasing longevity and the unfortunate consequence of genetics. They are mistaken.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors identify the research that has established the more likely cause of the rise in Parkinson's: the pesticides in our food and farms, the industrial toxins in the water we drink and the hidden particles in the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Armed with that knowledge, they say, a few simple lifestyle changes - from using water and air filters to rolling up your car windows in traffic - can reduce exposure and actually prevent the onset of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe their recommendations can even be effective with people who have a family history of the disease, and those who have already started to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to get started,' they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take a lesson from smoking. For smokers, cessation helps all regardless of age, and the benefits accrue fast - 20 minutes after the last cigarette smoked, an individual's heart rate returns to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Linda Ronstadt (pictured) lives with the rare brain disorder progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research shows that the more likely cause of the recent rise in Parkinson's includes the industrial toxins pumped into the air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both Dr Okun (left) and Dr Dorsey (right) have spent their professional lives studying brain diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A day later, the risk of heart attack lowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By nine months, coughing is reduced, and a decade later, the risk of lung cancer is halved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same could be true for environmental toxicants and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Let's stop waiting passively for Parkinson's to surface. Let's apply what we have learned and begin preventing the disease now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below are five of their 25 steps to prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Wash your produce (even if it's organic)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply. In 2024, Consumer Reports found that remnants of pesticides posed a significant health risk in 20 percent of common foods that it examined, including blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Purchasing organic produce, dairy products and meat can all help reduce exposure. However, even organic produce can have unsafe pesticide residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them. Use water and possibly a vegetable wash, because, like dirt, many pesticides do not dissolve in water. These washes are available in many grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pesticides have made their way into our food supply - foods at particular risk include blueberries, bell peppers and potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Regardless of whether you buy organic or conventional fruits and vegetables, wash them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vinegar and salt solutions are good options too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To determine what levels of pesticides are safe, the US Department of Agriculture measures them after food has been washed with water for 15 to 20 seconds. If that is their practice, yours should be even longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another way to reduce your overall exposure to pesticides without buying entirely organic produce is to consult the reports of the Environmental Working Group, which lists foods with a lot of exposure (the Dirty Dozen) and those with much less (the Clean Fifteen). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another good way to learn what pesticides are being used is to go to a farmer's market or join a community-supported agricultural farm where you can speak to the farmers who grow the crops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Don't go to a grocery store near a dry cleaners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perchloroethylene (PCE), the dry-cleaning chemical, can readily spread beyond the walls of a dry cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PCE dissolves in fat. In Germany, the chemical has been found in dairy products at supermarkets near dry cleaners - the levels at those shops were two to 20 times the levels found in those farther away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Germany now prohibits supermarkets from being located close to dry cleaners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, next time you go shopping at your local market, look around at the neighboring businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Have a cup of coffee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has repeatedly demonstrated that caffeine consumption is associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine may protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from the damage that results from exposure to toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits appear to be present regardless of your beverage of choice (coffee or tea) but are not present with decaffeinated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, caffeine has its own health risks, such as spurring on anxiety and headaches. But thanks to the research, you now have another reason to enjoy your morning cup of joe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exercise is the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his best-selling book, Outlive, Dr Peter Attia wrote: 'I now tell patients that exercise is, full stop and hands down, the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise may improve the function of the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, that are damaged by toxicants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity also releases growth factors in the brain that protect nerve cells, including the dopamine-producing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vigorous exercise can lower the risk of developing Parkinson's, and moving every day is also beneficial for those who already have the disease. A recent study found that six months of aerobic exercise (riding a stationary bike at least three times weekly, for example) reduced brain atrophy and slowed disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Golf with caution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While no studies, to our knowledge, have examined rates of Parkinson's among avid golfers, one study in 1996 looked at the death certificates of golf course superintendents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that these workers who commonly use pesticides to keep golf courses weed-free had twice the risk of dying due to a nervous system disorder than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What are the 25 million golfers in the US and 67 million worldwide to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ask your favorite course or club what pesticides they use and when they spray, encourage them to use less, and have them consider safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the interim, avoid playing on courses just after they have been sprayed, and don't lick your golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The full list of 25 actions is published in The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment by Ray Dorsey MD and Michael S Okun MD, PublicAffairs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                A new study finds that the brain does not appear to significantly rewire its map of the body after an amputation.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A rare circulatory problem required Emily Wheldon to have her left arm amputated three years ago. Her brain still thinks it's there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most days, it just feels like I've got my arm next to me," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The perception is so compelling that Wheldon had to train herself not to rely on the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I first had the amputation," she says, "I was trying to put my arm out to stop myself from falling."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of Wheldon and two other people with arm amputations may help explain why they are living with phantom limbs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brain scans showed that in all three, "the phantom hand representation is exactly similar to the pre-amputated hand representation," even five years after surgery, says &lt;a href="https://www.rnel.pitt.edu/people/hunter-schone-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Schone&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh who started the project as a doctoral student at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding, which appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, challenges decades-old research in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1843843" target="_blank"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/375482a0" target="_blank"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that after losing sensory input from a limb, the brain dramatically reorganizes the areas linked to that limb.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not sure the [new] study really negates that research," says &lt;a href="https://www.pennstatehealth.org/doctors/krishnankutty-sathian-mbbs-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Krish Sathian&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of neuroscience at Penn State Health, who was not involved in the research. "But the plot thickens, which is always the case in science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sathian and Schone agree the finding bodes well for people who rely on a surgically implanted brain-computer interface to control a prosthetic or robotic limb. The interface depends on the brain maintaining for many years the circuits once used to move an arm, hand, or leg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A brain map of the body&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news study involved three people who knew they were going to have an amputation because of cancer or some other disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers performed MRI scans before and after the amputation to look for changes in the &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/touch/2020/the-neuroscience-of-touch-and-pain-013020#:~:text=Sensations%20begin%20as%20signals%20generated,they're%20several%20centimeters%20apart." target="_blank"&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, an area of the brain that maintains a detailed map of the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you touch something with your hand, a certain region's activated," Schone says. "If you feel something with your toes, a different region is activated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the amputation, participants in the scanner would move their fingers, allowing scientists to see which brain regions responded. Up to five years after the amputation, participants imagined moving their missing fingers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies had suggested that after the loss of a hand, the brain would shift the borders of its body map. The area responding to the missing hand would shrink, while the neighboring area linked to the lips would expand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that's not what the team found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's no evidence that the map of the lips is changing," Schone says, "which goes completely against all of those old studies that suggest if you lose this body part, this region of the brain is going to completely reorganize."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Earlier studies were limited because they compared the brains of people who'd already lost a limb with the brains of typical people. The new study appears to be the first to look at the same person's brain before and after an amputation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Prosthetic arms and phantom limb pain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like many people who've had an amputation, Wheldon often feels pain in her phantom arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like a throbbing pain that becomes quite unbearable at times," she says. Sometimes it feels like her wrist is sore, other times it's like her fingers are cramping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previous research suggested phantom limb pain was the result of changes in the brain's body map. But the new study suggests it occurs &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;the map hasn't changed, and the brain is still expecting signals from the missing body part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine if you had a nerve that was receiving a highly detailed information for the body and suddenly now it's receiving some strange, atypical input," Schone says. "How the brain would deal with something like this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It might interpret the input as pain, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If so, he says, the solution may lie in finding a new home for a nerve ending, rather than just leaving it exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An unchanging body map could be a huge boost for the emerging field of brain-computer interfaces, which can allow a paralyzed person to speak or move a robotic arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of these interfaces place electrodes in the same area of the brain that maintains the body map. So they depend on that map remaining constant over many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new evidence for this "offers a lot of hope for patients with neurological conditions," Sathian says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emily Wheldon isn't seeking a brain-computer interface that could control a prosthetic left arm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she says it's helpful just to have a scientific explanation of why her missing limb still seems like it's attached, and sometimes hurts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of people don't realize that you can actually still feel the limb," she says, "and they're shocked when I say I'm suffering from phantom pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wheldon has been able to control that pain with electrical stimulation and a therapy that uses a visual representation of the missing limb. And she says the phantom pain is much less severe than the pain she felt when her arm was still there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Back then, the pain was so intense I couldn't look after my newborn daughter," she says. Now she's back at work and able to help her kids get dressed and ready for school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesg9amn001u26p58na1840r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just southwest of New Orleans, in a tranquil fishing village on the Louisiana bayou, Linard Lyons spent the morning on his 19-foot boat, preparing crab traps for his grandchildren just like he had done thousands of times before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeszzo2p000i3b6nhlhy3sd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, he noticed a tiny scratch on his leg – a scratch that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/health/dual-hurricanes-milton-and-helene-cause-flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-to-rise-in-florida" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;nearly cost him his life&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjiz00033j6o9dhb0hk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons went about his day but woke up the following morning feeling “delusional.” Feverish and vomiting, he initially thought he had just contracted a stomach bug, but then discovered a series of blackening sores spreading across his left leg.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000043j6of5cvjgau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In what turned out to be a life-saving move, he went straight to his family doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000053j6o34kkfv41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons tells CNN his doctor immediately knew “exactly what it was” and sent him straight to the emergency room. In the “matter of maybe an hour,” Lyons found himself in the hospital’s operating room.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000063j6o1487gcrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That small scratch on Lyons’ leg became the entryway for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/20/health/what-is-vibrio-explainer"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. Those black sores on his leg signified &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/health/sargassum-seaweed-blob-flesh-eating-bacteria-scn-wellness/index.html"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, which “affects the tissue under your skin,” according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23103-necrotizing-fasciitis" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000073j6ovya4755u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These potentially deadly bacteria are naturally found and thrive in coastal waters during the warmer months, especially in brackish waters, where fresh water meets the sea, according to the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html#:~:text=Vibrio%20are%20bacteria%20that%20naturally%20live%20in%20certain%20coastal%20waters.%20They%20are%20found%20in%20higher%20numbers%20in%20May%20through%20October%2C%20when%20water%20temperatures%20are%20warmer" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease and Control Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Once largely confined to the Gulf Coast, cases have surged along the East Coast, with an 800% increase from 1988 to 2018, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000093j6ozwekyk7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Do I have permission to do what I need to do to save your life?” Lyons’ doctor asked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000a3j6oj1547k3b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These were the last words Lyons recalled hearing before surgery. He immediately understood the seriousness of the situation and realized his leg may have to be amputated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000b3j6oi2ix73h4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was given a 50/50 chance of coming out of the hospital alive at that point,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000c3j6og3v0icqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surgeons were able to both cut away the infection and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;save Lyons’&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;leg. After three days in the intensive care unit, three weeks in the hospital and various antibiotics, he was “cleared of the bacteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000d3j6o37igh08h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It has been more than three months since he contracted the flesh-eating bacteria, yet his recovery is far from over.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000e3j6obudqm05k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery has not been comfortable for Lyons, who has diabetes; he describes it as a “misery.” Yet, he remains hopeful that a skin graft will be the final step in getting his leg back to “normal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000f3j6o5tne85no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vibrio vulnificus should generally not pose a fatal risk to the average person, Mississippi’s State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney tells CNN. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of contracting an infection, Edney said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000g3j6o0aaodvjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you plan to be in coastal water, assume it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is contaminated with Vibrio and avoid the water if you have “cuts or wounds that could be potentially infected,” according to Edney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000h3j6o5ve0cf9n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Vibrio infection doesn’t occur only through wound-to-water contact. It can also stem from consuming certain foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000j3j6ohhe5r4px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, SHELLFISH OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS.”&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000k3j6ofhmeurcx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This warning, often found in small print at the bottom of restaurant&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;menus, may look familiar. In Louisiana, this specific warning must be “clearly visible” at all establishments that sell or serve raw oysters – with few exceptions – according to the &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/page/654" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000l3j6o5o6k1wu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vibriosis can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Most often it’s a less serious infection from a different type of the bacteria, causing only stomach discomfort, but can occasionally find its way into the bloodstream, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html#:~:text=Vibrio%20are%20bacteria%20that%20cause,About%20150%E2%80%93200%20V." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000m3j6ohw7n35qw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oysters get their food by filtering out sea water. When that water is ripe with bacteria, a single oyster could contain as many as a million Vibrio vulnificus cells, according to &lt;a href="https://pages.charlotte.edu/jim-oliver/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jim Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000o3j6oq539u1zd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s rare, “many people with Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill,” according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000p3j6old747hzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Louisiana was one of the first states to bring attention to this infection this season after it saw a spike in cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000q3j6ow033e5nd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the end of July, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;officials reported&lt;/a&gt; 17 hospitalizations and four deaths among Louisiana residents, more than double what they typically see. At least three more cases were reported in August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000r3j6o65p7tzi4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This potentially deadly virus is not just unique to the Gulf states and is being found farther north as water temperatures rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000t3j6oz4ttrr8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; identified an “extremely rare” case of Vibrio vulnificus from a resident exposed to coastal water near Martha’s Vineyard. So far this year, Massachusetts has confirmed 71 cases, with a 30% hospitalization rate and no deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000u3j6ocrhay1vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Massachusetts, however, is not the only East Coast state reporting increased cases. Virginia Department of Health officials say cases of vibriosis across its residents have been “increasing over the last ten years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000v3j6o87vykfw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in North Carolina have increased 620% over the past 10 years, and New York’s have more than tripled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000w3j6oy4hovzsk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists link this trend to climate change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmesvb4lu00003b6n2wapy2ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oceans are getting warmer and sea level is rising because of human-caused climate change, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580166/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK580166.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scientists warn&lt;/a&gt; these factors are increasing the risk of Vibrio infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj0000z3j6o5isz7nq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oliver, the UNC Charlotte professor, added that melting glaciers are lowering ocean salinity – another factor that increases the threat. “Open sea salt water has too high of a salinity rate for Vibrio vulnificus,” he explained. But when fresh water dilutes it, the “conditions become more favorable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000103j6o90ntf17f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the climate warms, more bacteria stays alive through the winter, which worsens outbreaks in the summer because we’re starting from an already elevated level.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeswo6wb00043b6npv5rbebq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Rachel Noble, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied Vibrio since the early 2000s,&lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt; told CNN the increased prevalence of this potentially deadly bacterium is being “repeated globally,” indicating a “complexity of issues related to climate change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000123j6oam4l7997@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t going to be the only pathogen that increases in the face of climate change,” Noble said. “It’s just one example, but one we can really learn from.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000143j6ovvsnvnvz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lyons is encouraging others to learn about Vibrio and hopes local leaders will spread awareness by posting additional signage to warn both residents and visitors. Any wounds, even a tiny scratch, should be thoroughly washed with soap and clean running water, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Immediately%20wash%20wounds%20and%20cuts%20thoroughly%20with%20soap%20and%20clean%20running%20water%20after%20contact%20with%20coastal%20waters%20or%20raw%20seafood%2C%20its%20drippings%2C%20or%20its%20juices." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000153j6optzbugap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope my story helps people understand what to look out for,” Lyons said. It might even “save a life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmestmjj000163j6o35xxojr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you develop symptoms, “seek help immediately and get to the emergency room,” Lyons urges. “That’s the best thing. Just go there and hopefully you’ll see someone who will recognize it for what it is, because a misdiagnosis can be a death sentence. It really can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Here's what the findings really mean, why experts urge caution in interpreting the results, and what runners should watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems counterintuitive. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;Decades of evidence&lt;/a&gt; show regular exercise &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;lowers cancer risks&lt;/a&gt;, including bowel cancer, and improves outcomes &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/14/1010"&gt;after a cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg" alt="woman running" class="wp-image-172180 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise reduces risks of many cancers. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MABqghXaI2U/"&gt;Jacob Lund/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn't overturn that science. Instead, it suggests a narrow group of young, very high–volume endurance athletes might face unique bowel stress that could increase their odds of developing precancerous changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;Young people with colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been called a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="172173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bowel-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-under-50s-heres-what-might-explain-the-trend-246447"&gt;we don't really understand&lt;/a&gt; why it's &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova study deliberately excluded people with known genetic conditions or bowel disease to focus on runners who otherwise seemed low risk. Yet their screening found more advanced lesions than expected for that age group – a pattern outside experts, commenting in the New York Times, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as worth investigating, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might heavy endurance training contribute to bowel changes? One theory focuses on temporary blood flow reductions to the gut during prolonged, intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance runners are familiar with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5675973/"&gt;runner's colitis&lt;/a&gt; – cramping and occasional bleeding after long runs. Repeated cycles of low–oxygen stress, inflammation and tissue repair in the bowel could, theoretically, encourage adenoma development in susceptible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova team highlighted this mechanism based on observations and runners' reports of gut symptoms, though the study didn't directly measure blood flow, oxygen or inflammation markers. It also didn't isolate other lifestyle factors that might matter, such as dehydration strategies, anti–inflammatory drug use, specific nutrition practices, or very low body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is what this study doesn't establish. It doesn't prove marathons or ultramarathons cause bowel cancer. It doesn't show most young–onset bowel cancers occur in runners – doctors not involved in the study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;emphasised&lt;/a&gt; that most younger patients with these cancers aren't endurance athletes. And it doesn't address whether more moderate exercise carries similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comparison point – the expected rate of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1309086"&gt;advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; in the late 40s – comes from broader population studies, not from a matched control group. That makes the observed difference notable but still preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is clinically grounded, but its size and design mean it should be seen as a starting point for larger studies rather than a basis for changing general &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842825001064"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are practical lessons for endurance athletes and doctors. First, persistent blood in stool, changes in bowel habits, unexplained stomach pain, or iron–deficiency anaemia shouldn't be dismissed as "just running".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a community where gut complaints are common and often normalised, it's easy to miss warning signs. The lead oncologist argued that young runners with bleeding after long runs should be offered screening – a stance grounded in the fact that colonoscopy can remove precancerous lesions and prevent cancers developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more cautious than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for average–risk adults but aligns with individualised, symptom–driven care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the study reinforces the difference between exercise as medicine and exercise as extreme sport. For &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38920329/"&gt;cancer prevention and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02748-x"&gt;evidence supports regular&lt;/a&gt;, moderate–to–vigorous &lt;a href="https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-022-02670-3"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, not necessarily repeated ultra–endurance feats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg" alt="bowel polyp" class="wp-image-172178 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFwwWUduCY/"&gt;Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Careful attention needed – not panic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent conferences highlighted data showing structured exercise after bowel cancer treatment improves long–term outcomes, underlining that physical activity remains one of the most powerful, low–cost tools in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;cancer prevention and care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This runner study doesn't contradict that larger story. It flags a potential exception at the extreme end of training that needs careful attention, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms a link, what might change? Screening recommendations could evolve for a clearly defined group of high–volume endurance athletes, perhaps starting colonoscopy earlier than the current age–45 threshold for average–risk adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and coaches might adapt training, nutrition and recovery to protect gut health – paying attention to hydration, heat stress, gradual progression, and avoiding unnecessary anti–inflammatory medication around long efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine and gastroenterology clinics might work together on protocols for evaluating gut bleeding in runners, narrowing the gap between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/"&gt;"common" and "concerning"&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these steps depend on replication in larger, diverse groups and understanding which components of endurance life – intensity, duration, heat, altitude, nutrition – matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, a balanced message serves the public best. Endurance running is a profound source of meaning and health for many people, and quitting running isn't the lesson from a single small study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is keeping the proven benefits of exercise in view while being clear–eyed about potential risks at extremes. Listen to your body's signals, especially bleeding. Treat red–flag symptoms as medical, not merely athletic. And discuss personal risk factors and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955831/"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science probes this signal further, the likely outcome isn't a blanket warning but more nuanced guidance: who might need earlier screening, when to investigate symptoms, and how to train hard with the gut in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's real contribution may be cultural as much as clinical: it gives runners and doctors permission to ask a question they've too often waved away, and to catch dangerous lesions before they become cancers.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263564/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

This means it's more common in the warmer months, explaining the current increase in observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-pigs-turn-neon-blue-in-california-triggering-warnings"&gt;Wild Pigs Turn 'Neon Blue' in California, Triggering Warnings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNRySLQM8_x/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strokes are a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;leading cause of death in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 800,000 people experiencing one every year. On average, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are jarring and scary, especially for folks who have a family history of stroke or who have risk factors like high blood pressure and certain heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can arm yourself with knowledge to recognize the symptoms of a stroke, understand the risk factors and ultimately help protect yourself from experiencing one altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1649629932/brandon-giglio" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Brandon Giglio&lt;/a&gt;, the director of vascular neurology at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, about 85% of strokes in the United States are ischemic strokes, meaning they’re caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. About 15% are hemorrhagic strokes, which occur when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And among the people who have strokes, many also experience what is known as a warning stroke in the days, weeks or months beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about warning strokes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning strokes are known medically as transient ischemic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to most people outside of the medical field, warning strokes are a fleeting yet very dangerous medical condition that can be precursors to full-blown strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, up to one in five people who experience a warning stroke could have a stroke within 90 days if they don’t get medical attention, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24305-ahmed-itrat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Ahmed Itrat&lt;/a&gt;, the stroke medical director at Cleveland Clinic Akron General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a warning stroke? Medically, it’s referred to as a transient ischemic attack and causes “sudden-onset transient symptoms of neurological injury which resolve on their own,” Itrat said. “These symptoms may be similar to what one would consider a stroke, but the only difference is they don’t lead to a permanent neurological injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, transient ischemic attacks come on quickly, last for a short time, and do not result in the type of brain damage that can be seen with full-fledged strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lack of potential brain damage does not mean you should ignore a transient ischemic attack. It’s still a medical condition that needs to be taken seriously, Giglio said. “It really is a harbinger in many people for someone who is going to have a stroke even within the next 48 hours and certainly within the next seven, 30, 90 days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attacks are also commonly referred to as “ministrokes.” But &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/joshua-z-willey-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Joshua Willey&lt;/a&gt;, a stroke neurology expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said this problematic term minimizes the emergent nature of the condition. The phrase “warning strokes,” on the other hand, highlights that this condition is an emergency, just like a “regular” stroke, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The signs of transient ischemic attacks and strokes are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that basically all the same signs and symptoms of a stroke are the signs and symptoms of a transient ischemic attack,” Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts who spoke with HuffPost referred to “&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/stroke-warning-signs" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;BE FAST&lt;/a&gt;” as a widely accepted mnemonic device detailing the signs of stroke. And as the acronym suggests, these symptoms come on quickly, Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;alance — changes in balance or a loss of balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;yesight — changes in vision, like blurriness, loss of sight, or double vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;acial droop — drooping of the face or an uneven smile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;rm — arm weakness on one side of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;peech — changes in speech, like slurring words or speaking gibberish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime — it’s time to call emergency services. According to Willey, the “t” can also stand for the terrible headache that comes on fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could have all of those symptoms, you could have one of those symptoms or any mixture in between,” Giglio said. So, don’t wait around for more than one sign. If you notice any of these issues, go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BuzzFeed</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:30:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9CMzdwNDFiMWhoeEVFdHd0dFhvaHBpV1lsNDQ1QVZucW9xcDItUGJTMW9vQndabHFxdE5aQ2ZqU0pQWlYzZTlfajZNLXJfNlNQTUIxSnlxdUh4Y0JqZDhNZW1mUVFSbHR2emFfYzlvMl96bjBDdExNX0dhcw</guid></item><item><title>随着麻疹的爆发，西德克萨斯州的官员们向疾病预防控制中心的科学家没有人接听。- Salon.com</title><link>https://www.salon.com/2025/08/26/as-measles-exploded-west-texas-officials-looked-to-cdc-scientists-no-one-answered_partner/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="article__content page-article"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration’s actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency’s most critical function — emergency response — when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;interfered with&lt;/a&gt; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-trump-mmwr-bird-flu-studies-blocked-meddling/"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; the agency’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-data-analyses-missing-mmwr-bird-flu-seasonal-influenza/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/cdc-dei-scientific-data/681531/"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; its data, and abruptly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/probationary-federal-employees-agencies-firings-doge"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CDC hasn’t reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf"&gt;she added&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren’t allowed to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;rates drop&lt;/a&gt;, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/a&gt; in vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/"&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;Mexico’s Chihuahua state&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm"&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you’re battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The CDC is ‘stressed’ currently”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;late January&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren’t getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;another email&lt;/a&gt; what she’d learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that email &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/251.pdf"&gt;and others&lt;/a&gt;, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf"&gt;One email&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC’s recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/163.pdf"&gt;Milton wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed’ currently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn’t expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/"&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren’t able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC’s communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge"&gt;lay off&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It’s that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn’t need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there’s anything we could do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state’s correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That’s &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf"&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director, told KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren’t already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn’t spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/"&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn’t want to be tested, didn’t want to name their contacts, and didn’t want to talk with the health department. “It doesn’t matter what resources I have if people won’t avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against covid restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. &lt;a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump"&gt;Locals guess&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf"&gt;far larger&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf"&gt;U.S. Census&lt;/a&gt; count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don’t know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There’s a lot of people in the shadows out here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/"&gt;Clark County&lt;/a&gt;, Washington, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city’s health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City’s assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/"&gt;data from prior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a price tag to put on a child’s death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf"&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/a&gt;: “I’m so overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A death ignites a response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/a&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;brief notice&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;In emails&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC’s notice might exacerbate &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak"&gt;treating children&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/video/%e2%80%98its-been-flying-off-the-shelf%e2%80%99-lubbock-pharmacy-sees-more-vitamin-a-and-cod-liver-oil-purchases-amidst-west-texas-measles-outbreak/10533712/"&gt;reported on a large drugstore&lt;/a&gt; where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were “flying off the shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10788247/"&gt;dire abnormalities&lt;/a&gt; during fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups — including &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;one founded&lt;/a&gt; by Kennedy — that diminished the need for vaccination by &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/"&gt;inaccurately claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A staved off the disease’s worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?” Milton asked &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf"&gt;in an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. “HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,” one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency’s notices and alerts. “If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven’t seen those babies born yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they’ve had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We’re providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications"&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12271920/pdf/main.pdf"&gt;seldom useful&lt;/a&gt; against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with dangerously &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;inaccurate statements&lt;/a&gt;. “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.” There is &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full"&gt;doesn’t cause&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html"&gt;another interview,&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo"&gt;does not contain&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Staff are exhausted”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country’s first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Local hospitals are at capacity,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf"&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf"&gt;he added.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico"&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/"&gt;in decades&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion"&gt;13 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another child in West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04"&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/a&gt; in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn’t see the need to confirm it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;outbreak over&lt;/a&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/"&gt;on the fringes&lt;/a&gt; of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/a&gt; with measles on “medical mismanagement,” &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;without evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html"&gt;$11 billion&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid Lubbock’s toughest months, Wells sent &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/253.pdf"&gt;an email&lt;/a&gt; to the department’s exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Ways To Optimize Your Digestion As You Get Older&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is understandably frustrating and concerning. But experts stress there are ways to minimize any effects from age-related stomach issues. They recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chewing Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better digestion begins in the mouth. “Salivary enzymes help digest starch and fat in the mouth, decreasing the GI tract’s workload,” Mutha said. “The alkaline pH of saliva also helps neutralize acid in the esophagus due to reflux and alleviate GERD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Cutting your food into smaller pieces and chewing at least 15 to 20 times per bite can help mitigate any complications associated with trouble swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Saliva Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saliva production tends to decrease as we age, which can affect chewing and swallowing, Sohi said. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;, dry mouth is twice as likely to strike when you take one or more medications daily, compared with people with no medications on their roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like regularly using an over-the-counter saliva substitute or sipping water between bites can be helpful if dry mouth is a problem for you at mealtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating More Food That’s Plant-Based, Less That’s Processed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to optimize digestion is to eat a diet as low in processed foods and high in plant-based diversity as possible. “Diets high in processed food can alter the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis,” Sohi said, an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria that’s associated with higher rates of digestive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides keeping your gut microbiome on the rails, going plant-based is the best way to increase your fiber intake, which is crucial to the quality and consistency of your number two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber — soluble and insoluble — is what bulks up your poop, Mutha explained. This not only makes your time on the throne more pleasant and efficient, but it also decreases the likelihood of fecal incontinence and even helps treat diarrhea by absorbing water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is crucial to avoid constipation, Mutha said, especially once you start upping your fiber intake. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-stay-hydrated-for-better-health" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;National Council on Aging&lt;/a&gt; recommends drinking one-third of your weight in fluid ounces daily. That means if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should be drinking 50 ounces (or 6¼ cups) of water per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise stimulates the motility of the GI tract, so this can be very helpful for digestion,” Sohi said. “Lying recumbent on the couch after eating is one of the worst things you can do because not only does it not help with GI tract motility, but it can also promote acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutha agrees and recommends walking for roughly 15 minutes after your meals to help activate your stomach and improve gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a healing mechanism for the body, so not getting enough quality shut-eye — the recommendation is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt; — can adversely affect your gut barrier and immunity, Mutha said. Researchers are still nailing down the exact mechanisms behind how, but one theory is that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849511/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; leads to an increase in microscopic inflammation in the bowel that may domino into gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Your Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any and every medicine has GI side effects — even the ones that are prescribed for GI illnesses,” Mutha said. “Making sure you take your medications exactly as prescribed decreases the risk of side effects.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSAIDs should never be consumed on an empty stomach, for instance, while acid-suppressive medicines should be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. But if side effects happen anyway, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Check In With Your Doctor About Your Digestive Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re confident the digestive drama you’re experiencing is aging-related or a sign your lifestyle needs a revamp, “it’s important to not assume” and to “share your symptoms with your doctor anyway, as sometimes there can be a more serious underlying cause,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/neena-mohan" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Neena Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to persistent changes in bowel habits, you’re also experiencing trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, unexplained weight loss or have noticed blood in your poop (or it looks black and tarry), it’s time for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the issue, your doctor may start with bloodwork and prescribe medications or do further testing, such as an endoscopy or colonoscopy,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stomach-pain-increase-age_l_650c3421e4b0e83cc0da8dcf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But few are more of a bummer than the way our digestive system seems to lose interest in, well, digesting things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Intestinal issues can arise at any age and can become more prevalent as we age,” &lt;a href="https://providers.inspirahealthnetwork.org/provider/Sara+Attalla/1999340" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sara Attalla;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sara Attalla&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Inspira Health in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/digestive-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:60 million to 70 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;60 million to 70 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are affected by digestive diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some of the most common symptoms? Heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (as in constipation, diarrhea or even a combo of the two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nailing down what’s causing your digestive drama can be tricky since it’s a multi-faceted problem that typically stems from a highly individual combination of aging and lifestyle-related culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The Aging Process Can Affect Digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As we age, the nerves and muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can start to glitch, resulting in changes to how our digestive organs function individually and work together — usually, this translates into the digestion process itself becoming sluggish and communication signals between digestive organs getting haphazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Movement within the esophagus and muscles involved in swallowing may not be as effective or coordinated, for instance, and can lead to higher rates of esophageal reflux (known as GERD, where your stomach contents start to make a comeback), while slower motility in the stomach can cause what you’ve eaten to linger and trigger indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The stomach lining can also become thinner with age, which renders you more susceptible to injury in the stomach from things like inflammation,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decreased &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24411-prostaglandins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prostaglandin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prostaglandin production&lt;/a&gt; over time (a hormone-like substance that plays a role in stomach acid secretion and GI muscle functioning) means a decrease in the protective lining of the stomach, too, leaving you more prone to gastritis and ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next stop on your food’s digestive journey is a pit stop in the small bowel. “Slower motility here can lead to higher rates of bacterial overgrowth, which can cause bloating and diarrhea,” &lt;a href="https://gastrohealthpartners.com/physicians/dr-sunana-sohi-gastroenterologist-louisville-kentucky/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sunana Sohi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sunana Sohi&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Health Partners in Louisville, Kentucky, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if motility screeches to a halt in your colon, get ready for possible bouts of constipation and diverticulosis (a condition where small sacs form and push against weak spots in the wall of your colon, putting you at risk of symptom flareups, such as bleeding and inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then there’s the chronic health conditions that tend to stack up as we get older (arthritisis, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases), many of which can cause limitations to the level of movement we can tolerate, further exacerbating gut motility issues.

They recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chewing Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Better digestion begins in the mouth. “Salivary enzymes help digest starch and fat in the mouth, decreasing the GI tract’s workload,” Mutha said. “The alkaline pH of saliva also helps neutralize acid in the esophagus due to reflux and alleviate GERD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bonus: Cutting your food into smaller pieces and chewing at least 15 to 20 times per bite can help mitigate any complications associated with trouble swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Saliva Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Saliva production tends to decrease as we age, which can affect chewing and swallowing, Sohi said. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;, dry mouth is twice as likely to strike when you take one or more medications daily, compared with people with no medications on their roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Things like regularly using an over-the-counter saliva substitute or sipping water between bites can be helpful if dry mouth is a problem for you at mealtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating More Food That’s Plant-Based, Less That’s Processed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best way to optimize digestion is to eat a diet as low in processed foods and high in plant-based diversity as possible. “Diets high in processed food can alter the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis,” Sohi said, an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria that’s associated with higher rates of digestive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Besides keeping your gut microbiome on the rails, going plant-based is the best way to increase your fiber intake, which is crucial to the quality and consistency of your number two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fiber — soluble and insoluble — is what bulks up your poop, Mutha explained. This not only makes your time on the throne more pleasant and efficient, but it also decreases the likelihood of fecal incontinence and even helps treat diarrhea by absorbing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hydration is crucial to avoid constipation, Mutha said, especially once you start upping your fiber intake. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-stay-hydrated-for-better-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Council on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Council on Aging&lt;/a&gt; recommends drinking one-third of your weight in fluid ounces daily. That means if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should be drinking 50 ounces (or 6¼ cups) of water per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Exercise stimulates the motility of the GI tract, so this can be very helpful for digestion,” Sohi said. “Lying recumbent on the couch after eating is one of the worst things you can do because not only does it not help with GI tract motility, but it can also promote acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mutha agrees and recommends walking for roughly 15 minutes after your meals to help activate your stomach and improve gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep is a healing mechanism for the body, so not getting enough quality shut-eye — the recommendation is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven to nine hours per night;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt; — can adversely affect your gut barrier and immunity, Mutha said. Researchers are still nailing down the exact mechanisms behind how, but one theory is that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849511/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep deprivation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; leads to an increase in microscopic inflammation in the bowel that may domino into gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Your Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Any and every medicine has GI side effects — even the ones that are prescribed for GI illnesses,” Mutha said. “Making sure you take your medications exactly as prescribed decreases the risk of side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;NSAIDs should never be consumed on an empty stomach, for instance, while acid-suppressive medicines should be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. But if side effects happen anyway, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Check In With Your Doctor About Your Digestive Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if you’re confident the digestive drama you’re experiencing is aging-related or a sign your lifestyle needs a revamp, “it’s important to not assume” and to “share your symptoms with your doctor anyway, as sometimes there can be a more serious underlying cause,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/neena-mohan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Neena Mohan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Neena Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If, in addition to persistent changes in bowel habits, you’re also experiencing trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, unexplained weight loss or have noticed blood in your poop (or it looks black and tarry), it’s time for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Depending on the issue, your doctor may start with bloodwork and prescribe medications or do further testing, such as an endoscopy or colonoscopy,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stomach-pain-increase-age_l_650c3421e4b0e83cc0da8dcf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ravenishak/green-flags-in-people?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"That’s The Greenest Flag I Could Think Of": 16 Very Subtle Behaviors That Signal Someone Is A Really, Really Good Person;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;"That’s The Greenest Flag I Could Think Of": 16 Very Subtle Behaviors That Signal Someone Is A Really, Really Good Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/artemisstardust/tlc-kids-by-the-dozen?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Family Was On A TLC Reality Show.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal exposure to Chlorpyrifos in the womb disrupts brain development. Risks remain for children in farming communities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study has identified a connection between prenatal exposure to the commonly used insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and structural changes in the brain, along with reduced motor abilities, in children and adolescents living in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is the first to show that exposure before birth can lead to long-lasting and widespread molecular, cellular, and metabolic alterations in the brain, in addition to impairments in fine motor coordination. The study, conducted by scientists at &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Columbia University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Columbia University is an Ivy League institution based in New York City, recognized for its excellence in medicine, law, and scientific research.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt; Mailman School of Public Health, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and the Keck School of Medicine of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;USC&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The University of Southern California is a private research university in Los Angeles, known for strengths in medicine, engineering, and media studies.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;USC&lt;/span&gt;, appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Birth cohort study results&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis focused on 270 children and adolescents enrolled in the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health birth cohort study, all of whom were born to Latino and African-American mothers. Chlorpyrifos levels were detected in their umbilical cord blood, and they later underwent brain imaging and behavioral evaluations between the ages of 6 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that higher prenatal exposure was consistently linked to more pronounced disruptions in brain structure, function, and metabolism, as well as slower motor speed and impaired motor programming. Evidence across multiple neuroimaging methods indicated that the severity of abnormalities increased directly with the level of CPF exposure, suggesting a clear dose-response effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residential pesticide use was the main source of exposure for these children. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prohibited CPF for indoor household use in 2001, it continues to be applied in agriculture for non-organic crops such as fruits, vegetables, and grains. This ongoing use results in toxic exposure from outdoor air and dust, particularly near farming areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Expert warnings on vulnerable groups&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Current widespread exposures, at levels comparable to those experienced in this sample, continue to place farm workers, pregnant women, and unborn children in harm’s way. It is vitally important that we continue to monitor the levels of exposure in potentially vulnerable populations, especially in pregnant women in agricultural communities, as their infants continue to be at risk,” said Virginia Rauh, ScD, senior author on the study and the Jane and Alan Batkin Professor of Population and Family Health at Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The disturbances in brain tissue and metabolism that we observed with prenatal exposure to this one pesticide were remarkably widespread throughout the brain. Other organophosphate pesticides likely produce similar effects, warranting caution to minimize exposures in pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood, when brain development is rapid and especially vulnerable to these toxic chemicals,” says first author Bradley Peterson, MD, Vice Chair for Research and Chief of Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry at at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.&lt;/p&gt;

Using taxonomic graph analysis, researchers mapped personality from the ground up, uncovering new meta-traits and traits not captured by the Big Five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s bottom-up method highlights complex relationships between personality items, leading to a richer, more precise hierarchy. Beyond personality, this approach could also transform how clinicians classify and diagnose mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Five Expansion:&lt;/strong&gt; The new model identified six traits, including sociability, integrity, and impulsivity, expanding beyond the traditional five.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom-Up Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; TGA builds personality structures by analyzing statistical relationships between survey items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychopathology Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This method could lead to rethinking diagnoses, such as reframing anxiety as a subtype of depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexander Christensen’s recent study probably won’t rewrite 40 years of history in the field of psychology, but he hopes that his research team’s quantitative approach to developing and evaluating personality structures triggers a discussion about how personality is defined and measured. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such discussion could hold broader implications for the field of personality psychology and potentially for classifications in psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen and his colleagues’ article, “Revisiting the IPIP-NEO personality hierarchy with taxonomic graph analysis,” was published in June in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality surveys, informed by theoretical personality structures, are often organized in a hierarchy, and offer people a scientific understanding of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 40 years, the Big Five personality structure has been a highly regarded tool for creating psychological profiles. The Big Five traits are conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen, an assistant professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt Peabody College of education and human development, says that the Big Five structure has been a culturally robust and predictive model for personality, but he believes it can be improved using advanced data science methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common methods for understanding and measuring personality begin with the Big Five traits and connect to more refined characteristics further down in the hierarchy in a top-down, siloed approach (as shown in the structure below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach can miss important statistical relationships between items (or individual survey questions). Items are the building blocks of personality taxonomies. Understanding the relationships between them is key to developing scientifically valid structures higher up the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new and improved approach to personality structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In  their new study, Christensen and his colleagues apply taxonomic graph analysis (TGA), a network for measuring the relationships between psychological variables, to the IPIP-NEO personality inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using TGA as the tool for building the personality structure allows relationships to emerge from the bottom-up by making empirical connections between items to “facets” (narrow personality characteristics) to traits like the Big Five.  The quantitative power of TGA uncovers a new, more precise structure (shown below) for measuring and describing personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the research team’s new three-tiered IPIP-NEO taxonomic structure, they found three meta-traits (stability, plasticity, and the new disinhibition), six traits (neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness, and three new ones: sociability, integrity, and impulsivity), and 28 facets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application to psychopathology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond personality, I think this bottom-up approach could have an impact on how we develop classifications of psychopathology,” Christensen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathology structures (as exemplified above) follow a similar top-down approach to personality structures. As an example of how TGA could lead to reclassification and a change in diagnoses, Christensen points to the overlapping symptoms associated with internalizing disorders, specifically depression and anxiety. They often are diagnosed together but as two distinct diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a TGA investigation of psychopathology structures might reveal two types of depression with anxiety being a component of one of these types, not a distinct diagnosis itself. If that were the case, a mental health practitioner could possibly diagnose someone with a specific type of depression, rather than with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Christensen says, “The paper’s lasting impact will be in the value of taxonomic graph analysis and the methods we developed for investigating complex psychological structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of “team-science”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen credits the breakthroughs of this paper to the “team-science” approach that bridged longstanding theoretical scholarship and recent innovations in data science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lead author Andrew Samo approached me a few years ago with this idea of examining the hierarchical structure of personality, and I thought we had developed some tools that we could apply to the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wouldn’t have been able to do this study without bringing together Andrew’s substantive and theoretical team and my quantitative team. It’s a great example of what team science can accomplish,” Christensen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to take a shortened version of the survey Christensen and colleagues investigated, it is &lt;a href="https://bigfive-test.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;freely available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen teaches Behavioral Data Science in the Psychological Sciences Ph.D. program and Quantitative Methods M.Ed. program.

They can brainstorm ideas, draft documents, answer questions, and even help with everyday planning. The more you use it, the more tempting it becomes to let it handle just about everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;That doesn't mean it's always the right tool. ChatGPT is an LLM-based &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-ai-chatbots/" target="_self"&gt;chatbot&lt;/a&gt; that can certainly help with a variety of tasks, but it can also sound confident even when it's wrong, sometimes producing false details or outdated info. For casual use, that might not be a big deal, but when money (including your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/doing-your-taxes-at-the-last-minute-chatgpt-isnt-the-time-saver-you-need/" target="_self"&gt;taxes&lt;/a&gt;), health, or legal matters are involved, relying on it can create bigger problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing when &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use ChatGPT is just as important as knowing how to use it well. To help you avoid the most common pitfalls, here are 11 situations where turning to an AI chatbot could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com" target="_self"&gt;Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, the parent company of CNET, in April filed a lawsuit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Diagnosing physical health issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've definitely fed ChatGPT my symptoms out of curiosity, but the answers that come back can read like your worst nightmare. As you pore over potential diagnoses, you could swing from dehydration and the flu to some type of cancer. I have a lump on my chest and entered that information into ChatGPT. Lo and behold, it told me I may have cancer. In fact, I have a lipoma, which is not cancerous and occurs in one in every 1,000 people. My licensed doctor told me that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying there are no good uses of ChatGPT &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/chatgpt-for-self-diagnosis-ai-is-changing-the-way-we-answer-our-own-health-questions/" target="_self"&gt;for health&lt;/a&gt;: It can help you draft questions for your next appointment, translate medical jargon and organize a symptom timeline so you can walk in better prepared. And that could help make doctor visits less overwhelming. However, AI can't order labs or examine you, and it definitely doesn't carry malpractice insurance. Know its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Taking care of your mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can offer grounding techniques, sure, but it can't pick up the phone when you're in real trouble with your mental health. I know some people use ChatGPT as a substitute therapist. CNET's Corin Cesaric found it mildly helpful for working &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-used-ai-to-help-with-grief-heres-what-experts-think-about-using-it-this-way/" target="_self"&gt;through grief&lt;/a&gt;, as long as she kept its limits front of mind. But as someone who has a very real, very human therapist, I can tell you that ChatGPT is still really only a pale imitation at best, and incredibly risky at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatpGPT doesn't have lived experience, can't read your body language or tone, and has zero capacity for genuine empathy. It can only simulate it. A licensed therapist operates under legal mandates and professional codes that protect you from harm. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ai-as-your-therapist-3-things-that-worry-experts-and-3-tips-to-stay-safe/" target="_self"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; doesn't. Its advice can misfire, overlook red flags or unintentionally reinforce biases baked into its training data. Leave the deeper work -- the hard, messy, human work -- to an actual human who is trained to properly handle it. If you or someone you love is in crisis, please &lt;a href="https://chat.988lifeline.org/" target="_self"&gt;dial 988&lt;/a&gt; in the US, or your local hotline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Making immediate safety decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your carbon-monoxide alarm starts chirping, please don't open ChatGPT and ask it if you're in real danger. I'd go outside first and ask questions later. Large language models can't smell gas, detect smoke or dispatch an emergency crew. In a crisis, every second you spend typing is a second you're not evacuating or dialing 911. ChatGPT can only work with the scraps of info you feed it, and in an emergency, it may be too little and too late. So treat your chatbot as a postincident explainer, never a first responder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Getting personalized financial or tax planning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT can explain what an ETF is, but it doesn't know your debt-to-income ratio, state tax bracket, filing status, deductions, retirement goals or risk appetite. Because its training data may stop short of the current tax year, and of the latest rate hikes, its guidance may well be stale when you hit enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have friends who dump their 1099 totals into ChatGPT for a DIY return. The chatbot simply can't replace a CPA who can catch a hidden deduction worth a few hundred dollars or flag a mistake that could cost you thousands. When real money, filing deadlines, and IRS penalties are on the line, call a professional, not AI. Also, be aware that anything you share with an AI chatbot will probably become part of its training data, and that includes your income, your Social Security number and your bank routing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Dealing with confidential or regulated data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a tech journalist, I see embargoes land in my inbox every day, but I've never thought about tossing any of these press releases into ChatGPT to get a summary or further explanation. That's because if I did, that text would leave my control and land on a third-party server outside the guardrails of my nondiscloure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same risk applies to client contracts, medical charts or anything covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act, HIPAA, the GDPR or plain old trade-secret law. It applies to your income taxes, birth certificate, driver's license and passport. Once sensitive information is in the prompt window, you can't guarantee where it's stored, who can review it internally or whether it may be used to train future models. ChatGPT also isn't immune to hackers and security threats. If you wouldn't paste it into a public Slack channel, don't paste it into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Doing anything illegal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Cheating on schoolwork&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd be lying if I said I never cheated on my exams. In high school, I used my first-generation iPod Touch to sneak a peek at a few cumbersome equations I had difficulty memorizing in AP calculus, a stunt I'm not particularly proud of. But with AI, the scale of modern cheating makes that look remarkably tame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turnitin and similar detectors are getting better at spotting AI-generated prose every semester, and professors can already hear "ChatGPT voice" a mile away (thanks for ruining my beloved em dash). Suspension, expulsion and getting your license revoked are real risks. It's best to use ChatGPT as a study buddy, not a ghostwriter. You're also just cheating yourself out of an education if you have ChatGPT do the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Monitoring information and breaking news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT Search in late 2024 (and opened it to everyone in February 2025), the chatbot can fetch fresh web pages, stock quotes, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/gas-prices-hold-steady-after-iran-ceasefire-despite-dubious-8gallon-warnings-in-california/" target="_self"&gt;gas prices&lt;/a&gt;, sports scores and other real-time numbers the moment you ask, complete with clickable citations so you can verify the source. However, it won't stream continual updates on its own. Every refresh needs a new prompt, so when speed is critical, live data feeds, official press releases, news sites, push alerts and streaming coverage are still your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Gambling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've actually had luck with ChatGPT and hitting a three-way parlay during the NCAA men's basketball championship, but I would never recommend it to anyone. I've seen ChatGPT hallucinate and provide incorrect information on player statistics, misreported injuries and win-loss records. I only cashed out because I double-checked every claim against real-time odds, and even then I got lucky. ChatGPT can't see tomorrow's box score, so don't rely on it solely to get you that win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Drafting a will or other legally binding contract&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is great for breaking down basic concepts. If you want to know more about a revocable living trust, ask away. However, the moment you ask it to draft actual legal text, you're rolling the dice. Estate and family-law rules vary by state, and sometimes even by county, so skipping a witness signature or omitting the notarization clause can get your whole document tossed. Rather, let ChatGPT help you build a checklist of questions for your lawyer, then pay that lawyer to turn that checklist into a document that stands up in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Making art&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't an objective truth, just my own opinion, but I don't believe AI should be used to create art. I'm not anti-artifical intelligence by any means. I use ChatGPT for brainstorming new ideas and help with my headlines, but that's supplementation, not substitution. By all means, use ChatGPT, but please don't use it to make art that you then pass off as your own. It's kind of gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNZGpCQVpwNGxmbkVndHVnbUw2Q1p2YlRTdUxaa2JqY19hd0YxckpCNktMTGlDWXgzNHFMRG5JUnRQM01GeExGWV9DMWlHMEdyN0dkNXl5RlZwNjNzQ0lDNDFKemFXUG9PNEdHNlJvYjcyLXluNWNNNkNfZVVEY1hUR3VQcXIyZmFhTU1obGtDNk9ZS0ZoUUlpeEYtVG1EMllBeURIMHNISFZFSFRUUlBHRzN5N2JnZ1E</guid></item><item><title>我在47岁时被诊断出患有阿尔茨海默氏症，我的生活永远改变了- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristatorres/this-47-year-old-woman-early-onset-alzheimers-disease-tiktok</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

  &lt;h2 class="subbuzz__header subbuzz__header--standard subbuzz__title "&gt;
    

    
      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;It was then that Staci went to her primary care practitioner with her symptoms and suspicions, and got further testing done as she shared in her TikTok. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tryingnottoforget/video/7525953178119048478" target="_blank"&gt;She also emphasized how she had to really advocate for herself.&lt;/a&gt; "I remember she said, 'Early-onset Alzheimer's is really rare at your age, but let's send you to a neurologist specializing in memory care and have you checked out.'"&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After her cognitive scores showed mild cognitive impairment in December of 2024, her doctor ordered MRIs of the brain and spine, an EEG, and more bloodwork. "This was to rule out Multiple Sclerosis, seizures, brain bleeds, tumors, and a bunch of other stuff. All of the diagnostic testing came back normal. I went back for a second neurology visit in February of 2025, and we discussed the possibility of it being ADHD, or my anxiety and depression. So she ordered a neuropsych evaluation," added Staci. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was finally able to get the blood biomarker testing after continuing to advocate and express concern about her grandmother having the disease. When the biomarkers came back high for Alzheimer's, she got the PET scan that showed widespread amyloid plaques in her brain. Luckily, insurance covered the cost of the tests for her.&lt;/p&gt;

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;delayed authorization of the fall COVID shots&lt;/a&gt; and dismissed the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials say the result is confusion and dwindling supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines, between the slow shutting down of ’24-’25 vaccine availability and access to the ’25-’26 version,” Willis said. “This is particularly concerning in California as our transmission rates continue to climb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical organizations are breaking ranks with the administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics urged vaccination for infants and children, while the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advised shots during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both recommendations stand in contrast to new federal guidelines that limit eligibility largely to older adults and those with chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences are already visible.

Doctors say many patients describe a harsher sore throat than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it more dangerous?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, no. The World Health Organization says the overall risk is “low,” and evidence suggests Stratus is not causing more severe illness than earlier strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will vaccines still work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Experts say last year’s shots and the pending 2025-26 vaccines should still protect against severe disease, though federal delays may make access harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do at-home COVID-19 tests detect newer variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, according to infectious disease experts. That’s because the antigen detected by at-home tests “has remained fairly stable even as the virus mutates and new strains of COVID develop,” Harvard Medical School instructor Dr. Michelle Chan &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-tests-do-at-home-tests-work-on-newer-variants" data-link="native" class=""&gt;said on the university’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 20:14:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQd1pjcDNZQUEyRW9QMDhCVENPT2h1T1M5bzZ3UG5USjZNeXY3LWNJRFRCNlktNFVNb2VwcWlnMXhEVlAtcmRLSzd5cnpiLURxOHpZSWtWU0prSW5FLU43a1J0THZ4QW1nOWVGXzNfdEFqMEJ1U0lmdVJ4UzVpWTdRQnhsX3pYMl9EZ0xKdXROZlZrdw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，心脏病患者应该接种包括新冠肺炎在内的呼吸道疾病疫苗- PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/heart-disease-patients-should-get-vaccinated-against-respiratory-illnesses-including-covid-19-cardiology-experts-say</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The American College of Cardiology issued new guidance Tuesday that recommends adults with heart disease get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including RSV, COVID-19, pneumococcal infection, shingles and influenza. Just weeks out from cold and flu season, the &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2025/08/26/11/44/New-ACC-CCG-Consolidates-Recommendations-on-Immunization"&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; marks a departure from official U.S. guidance as the Trump administration makes moves to limit vaccine access, particularly for COVID-19 shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living with heart disease are already considered a high-risk group, “no matter what their age,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a spokesperson for the college and a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He said vaccine-preventable infections can be more serious in people who have underlying chronic heart disease and can disrupt their care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can cause more heart failure, and some of these infections predispose actually to heart attacks,” Schaffner said. “Of course, those are things every cardiologist would like to prevent on behalf of their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/who-is-eligible-for-a-covid-shot-what-to-know-about-the-fdas-latest-changes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is eligible for a COVID shot? What to know about the latest U.S. changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists are urged to either vaccinate their patients themselves or to make a strong recommendation for patients to get vaccinated, the new guidelines said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for infectious diseases like COVID have declined in recent years. In a KFF poll published Aug. 1, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-while-most-adults-do-not-expect-to-get-a-covid-19-shot-this-fall-those-who-want-one-worry-about-access-and-insurance-coverage/"&gt;6 in 10 U.S. adults said they were not likely to get the updated COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a steep decline since the pandemic began five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical societies like the ACC, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; have historically recommended vaccines to protect people against seasonal viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this season’s emerging set of guidelines stand out because they contradict statements from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who founded Children’s Health Defense, an organization that promotes vaccine skepticism. Kennedy has ratcheted up restrictions to vaccine access since the Senate confirmed him in February,including cutting off funding for all mRNA vaccine research and ending national recommendations that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/cdc-removes-language-that-says-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women-should-get-covid-shots"&gt;pregnant people and children get vaccinated against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter these claims, ACOG and the AAP have each offered their own evidence-based recommendations that pregnant people and children should get vaccinated against COVID to prevent the risk of severe outcomes, including hospitalization and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the discourse around vaccination shifts, vaccine recommendations are likely to continue moving forward, said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, the chief medical officer for prevention at the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez said he hoped that hearing another recommendation for getting vaccinated from “yet another credible science-based source of information would add that to the reasons why [people] should trust vaccines and expect that they’re going to benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has also taken steps to control, if not silence, those who have traditionally advised the government on vaccine policies and best practices. On June 9, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-17-person-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee"&gt;he fired all members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with several vaccine skeptics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re not following the body of science at all,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who also directs the Vaccine Integrity Project. Osterholm cautioned that myths and disinformation are “likely to confuse parents and consumers of vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;

Over 10 percent of women had three or more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers relied on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a gold-standard CDC dataset that contains health data spanning from 2007 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 34 percent of women in the study had obesity and about five percent had diabetes, while 80 percent were deficient in folate, also known as vitamin B9, a compound crucial during pregnancy for preventing birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, nearly one in five women were shown to have exposure to nicotine in the forms of smoking, vaping, or second-hand inhalation, which has been shown in past research to significantly increase the risk of premature birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13183373/Parents-unknowingly-putting-babies-risk-suffocation-sudden-death-syndrome-simple-mistake-warns-charity.html"&gt;and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven percent of women struggled to afford nutritious food, which led to poor nutrition for the fetus and a higher risk of obesity in the future. The study said that women facing food insecurity might also struggle to afford prenatal vitamins, eat nutritious food, or manage their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Birth defects are common, affecting one in 33 babies, and account for about one in five &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15032523/Southern-state-emergency-infant-mortality-mississippi.html"&gt;infant deaths&lt;/a&gt;. They can range from mild, such as webbed toes or a club foot, to fatal, such as anencephaly, a condition where parts of the brain and skull don’t form, or Trisomy 13, which causes malformed organs. They are a leading cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15032523/Southern-state-emergency-infant-mortality-mississippi.html"&gt;of death in infants&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for about one in five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk factors researchers considered raised the risks of babies being born with heart defects, such as improperly formed valves, neural tube defects such as spina bifida, and orofacial clefts, including cleft lip and cleft palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A CDC study found that two-thirds of American women of reproductive age have at least one major risk factor, such as obesity, smoking, food insecurity, or low folate levels, that can increase the chance of birth defects (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact causes of birth defects are often unknown, scientists generally agree that a complex mix of genetic predispositions, environmental influences, and lifestyle choices is at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 25 percent of birth defects are caused by genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, including conditions like Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra chromosome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Environmental causes, such as infections in the pregnant mother, maternal diabetes, nutritional deficiencies like a lack of folate, and exposure to certain drugs account for five to 10 percent of birth defects, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222074/#:~:text=Genetic%20(chromosomal%20and%20single%2Dgene)%20causes,0.5%20percent%20of%20newborn%20infants."&gt;NIH.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that ‘complex genetic or unknown causes’ are behind 65 percent of most birth defects, the NIH scientists reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are not caused by a single faulty gene, but rather, a complex interplay between genes interacting with each other or a combination of genetic predispositions and unknown environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not explain exactly how the risk factors lead to birth defects, but cited the one-carbon cycle, a network of chemical reactions in the body that uses nutrients like folate, vitamin B12, and choline to make DNA, regulate genes, and support cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the cycle malfunctions, such as when folate is low during pregnancy, it can disrupt DNA synthesis and cell division in a developing embryo. This increases the risk of birth defects, particularly neural tube defects like spina bifida and deadly anencephaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still trying to work out how exactly the health of the mother leads to malformations in their babies&lt;span&gt;. Still, past research has shown that obesity and diabetes can &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6619680/"&gt;change how the body&lt;/a&gt; processes folate and other nutrients. At the same time,&lt;/span&gt; smoking introduces toxins that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2556992/"&gt;interfere with folate metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and increase oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Birth defects are a leading cause of death in infants, accounting for about one in five. Non-Hispanic Black women bore the highest burden, with 80 percent having at least one risk factor versus 62 percent of white women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said: ‘Previous studies have suggested that these risk factors may be attenuated through the consumption of folic acid (FA) periconceptionally and during organogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A developing fetus needs folate to make healthy new cells as well as to make DNA and RNA. Folate is also essential for the formation of normal red blood cells and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors recommend folic acid supplements, which are made up of the synthetic form of folate, over dietary folate alone, as they are more reliably absorbed in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women can get natural folate from a variety of foods, with the best sources being dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale, lentils and other legumes, asparagus, avocados, and broccoli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Citrus fruits, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods like cereals and breads, which contain the synthetic form, folic acid, are also excellent sources of the key nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women who may become pregnant should take a supplement containing 400 micrograms of folic acid. But those who lack access to nutritious food are less likely to take supplements for prenatal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly seven percent of women faced severe food insecurity, meaning they regularly struggled to afford enough food. When it came to crucial prenatal nutrients, the data revealed that while about 28 percent of women took a folic acid supplement, only 13 percent were taking the recommended daily dose of 400 micrograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-nine percent of women were not getting enough folic acid from food alone, and even when supplements were included, eight in 10 still fell short of the recommended amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deficiencies were confirmed by blood tests, which showed that one in five women had folate levels low enough to increase the risk of severe neural tube defects, severe disorders in babies that occur in the first month of pregnancy, where the embryonic structure that forms the brain and spinal cord fails to close properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that while less than half of women in their teens and early twenties had risk factors, that number jumped to nearly three-quarters of women aged 35 to 49, mainly because the prevalence of conditions like obesity and diabetes increases with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also uncovered stark racial and economic disparities. Non-Hispanic black women faced the highest burden, with 80 percent having at least one risk factor, compared to 62 percent of non-Hispanic white women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-Hispanic black women also had the highest rates of severe food insecurity and the lowest levels of folate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, women living in poverty were far more likely to have multiple risk factors compared to those with higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest findings were published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00438-6/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of birth defects are chronic, such as microphthalmia, which causes lifelong vision impairment; Spina Bifida, which requires a lifetime of mobility assistance, bladder and bowel function help, and potential for fluid on the brain; and Down Syndrome, which carries lifelong implications, including intellectual disability, possible heart defects, and higher risks for other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For one thing, women's health has only been taken seriously by the medical establishment for the past few decades; the &lt;a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;FDA wasn't even required&lt;/a&gt; to include women in clinical trials until 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are some indications that medical reticence may be hurting men in sweeping ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.98.21.2334" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the American Heart Association in the late 1990s, men made up 75 percent of all sudden cardiac deaths, with men aged 45 to 75 particularly likely to die due to coronary artery disease. With symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early warning signs&lt;/a&gt;, coronary artery disease can easily be treated if it's caught early enough — but men have to convince themselves to go to the doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though heart disease remains the leading cause of death &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;among men globally&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11642101/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, prostate cancer is another major killer that could be treated effectively by regular screenings. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;American Cancer Society estimates&lt;/a&gt; that in the US, one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes — and that one in 44 men will ultimately die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Eric Wallen, the chair of urology at Medical University of South Carolina, a lot of men erroneously believe they don't need to get prostate exams, which are indeed uncomfortable, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/rrrtrh/are_prostate_exams_any_worse_than_pap_smears/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;probably not much more so&lt;/a&gt; than a pap smear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think a lot of people are falling back on, 'Well, that’s not really recommended,'" Wallen told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(According to the University of California at Los Angeles' Health system, those screenings &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/no-early-warning-signs-its-important-to-keep-up-with-prostate-cancer-screenings" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;very much &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all men between the ages of 50 and 55, or at age 45 if they have a family member with prostate cancer.

By studying mice with a common genetic mutation, researchers found abnormal changes in retinal blood vessels that paralleled brain changes linked to dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the retina functions as an accessible extension of the brain, these findings highlight its potential as a powerful biomarker. The research paves the way for routine eye exams to aid in early diagnosis and intervention for Alzheimer’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retina as Brain Window:&lt;/strong&gt; The retina shares tissue with the brain, making it a reliable site to track neurological health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice with the MTHFR677C&amp;gt;T mutation showed early retinal vessel abnormalities tied to dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Routine eye exams could one day detect Alzheimer’s risk 20 years before symptoms appear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the next few years, doctors may be able to spot signs of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias using routine eye exams well before symptoms appear, a new study suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, links abnormal changes in the tiny blood vessels of the retinas of mice with a common genetic mutation known to increase Alzheimer’s disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112450"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Even though more studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of how vascular health in the retina affects the risk of dementia, the new insights have important implications for people with this genetic factor, Reagan said. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings build on previous work from the same group at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), which found similar vascular changes in mice’s brains and linked abnormalities in specific retinal cells to early dementia risk, strengthening the case that the retina is a powerful biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re at an optometrist or ophthalmologist appointment, and they can see odd vascular changes in your retina, that could potentially represent something that is also happening in your brain, which could be very informative for early diagnostics,” said Alaina Reagan, a neuroscientist at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) who led the work with Gareth Howell, professor and Diana Davis Spencer Foundation Chair for Glaucoma Research at JAX who spearheaded the previous study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the retina is part of the central nervous system, scientists often see it as an extension of the brain that shares essentially the same tissue. That’s why changes in retinal blood vessels can offer early clues about brain health and diseases like Alzheimer’s, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your retina is essentially your brain, but it’s much more accessible because your pupil is just a hole, and we can see tons of stuff,” Reagan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the cells are very similar, all the neurons are quite similar, all the immune cells are quite similar, and they behave similarly under pressure if you’ve got a disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team studied mice with a mutation called MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, which is found in up to 40% of people. They found that the mice’s retinas had twisted vessels, narrowed and swollen arteries, and less vessel branching as early as six months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects similar changes in the brain linked to poor blood flow and increased risk of cognitive decline. Vessels that appear more twisted and looped than normal can signal problems with hypertension, as the narrowing tissue limits nutrient and oxygen transport, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see these wavy vessels in the retinas, which can occur in people with dementia,” Reagan said. “That speaks to a more systemic problem, not just a brain- or retina-specific problem. It could be a blood pressure problem affecting everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a study by the same group revealed similar vascular changes in the brains of mice with the same MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; mutation, highlighting the link between vascular health in the retina that resembles human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mice have fewer vessels in their cortex and reduced blood flow to their brains,” Reagan said. “These changes are subtle, but they are there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered changes in protein patterns in both the brain and retina. They found disruptions in how cells produce energy, remove damaged proteins, and maintain the structure and support of blood vessels, offering important clues about how the MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T &lt;/sup&gt;mutation affects the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also support a growing theory that blood vessel health plays a central role in neurodegenerative diseases, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these molecular changes are happening in conjunction, which suggests these systems in brain and retinal tissue are working in tandem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though more studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of how vascular health in the retina affects the risk of dementia, the new insights have important implications for people with this genetic factor, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the study also captured the influence of sex and age, with female mice showing worse outcomes. By 12 months, they showed reduced vessel density and branching, highlighting progressive vascular changes. Similarly, women develop dementia more often than men, according to the World Health Organization.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if the link between the mutation and vascular changes occurs in humans, as well as whether the new insight could be used in eye exams, the team is partnering with clinicians and dementia care specialists at Northern Light Acadia Hospital in Bangor, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to study not just one cause or solution for Alzheimer’s and other dementias, as these conditions depend on many different genetic and environmental factors, but to learn more about how eye health adds to overall risk for these diseases. If the clinicians know which signs to look for, they could communicate those risk factors to patients and recommend further tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people over 50 have some kind of vision impairment and get checked annually for prescription changes,” Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are they more at risk if they have these vascular changes, and is that a point when doctors could start mitigating brain changes? That could be 20 years before cognitive damage becomes noticeable to patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors are Michael MacLean, Travis L. Cossette, and Gareth R.

We examine retinal vascular health in a mouse containing the ADRD risk variant &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to determine if changes in retina mirror similar changes in cerebrovasculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morphology and function of retinal vasculature and neurons were assessed using in vivo imaging, immunohistochemistry, and pattern electroretinography. RNAscope and proteomics were employed to determine &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt; gene expression and differential protein expression in mice carrying &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice show age- and sex-dependent retinal vascular deficits, displaying similarities to previously published brain data. &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt; is widely expressed and co-localizes with vascular cell markers. Proteomics identified common molecular signatures across the brain and retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt;-dependent vascular phenotypes occur in brain and retina similarly.

"If a person has the bubonic form of plague -- plague with that inflamed lymph node -- that can point a clinician in the correct direction pretty quickly. However, if somebody has a septicemic or pneumonic plague without the enlarged lymph nodes, that initial presentation can resemble many other diseases, and that's one of the challenges that we see in terms of getting someone on the appropriate treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's critical for someone to be treated promptly, because plague can be fatal very quickly," Phipps added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Plague is treatable with commonly available antibiotics and the chances of full recovery are higher if a patient seeks medical care early, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/diagnosis-testing/index.html#cdc_testing_what_next-treatment" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To reduce the risk of plague, the NMDOH recommends avoiding sick or dead rodents and rabbits; cleaning up areas near the home where rodents could live; using insect repellent when outdoors; and keeping hay and wood as far away from the house as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, the NMDOH recommends having a sick pet examined immediately by a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although this is the first human case of plague recorded in New Mexico this year, it is not the first in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Last week, a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/california-resident-tests-positive-plague/story?id=124814023" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;California resident tested positive for plague&lt;/a&gt; after likely being bitten by an infected flea while camping, according to local health officials in the state.

							&lt;p data-start="310" data-end="438"&gt;Staying mentally sharp isn’t just luck—it’s the byproduct of dozens of small choices that build on each other year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="440" data-end="771"&gt;I’ve met people in their 80s who can still debate politics with more clarity than people half their age, who remember old lyrics and recent headlines with equal sharpness, and who learn new apps faster than their grandkids. These aren’t outliers. They’ve cultivated habits that quietly protect their minds from dulling with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="773" data-end="917"&gt;The good news is that these habits aren’t exclusive to them. They’re accessible to anyone, and the earlier you start, the stronger the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="919" data-end="977"&gt;Here are nine of those habits worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="984" data-end="1021"&gt;1. They keep learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1088"&gt;Sharp older adults have one thing in common: they stay curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1090" data-end="1325"&gt;It doesn’t always mean going back to school. Sometimes it’s taking up watercolor painting, learning the basics of coding, or diving into podcasts on topics they know nothing about. The point is—they never stop being students of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1327" data-end="1538"&gt;As neuroscientist Dr. Michael Merzenich has said, “The brain is like a muscle. If you don’t give it a workout, it will weaken.” That workout doesn’t come from passive consumption—it comes from active learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1540" data-end="1919"&gt;When I was traveling through Portugal, I stayed with a couple in their 70s who had just started studying astronomy. Every evening, they’d set up a telescope and try to identify constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1540" data-end="1919"&gt;They weren’t doing it for recognition or to “stay young.” They were simply curious. And that curiosity made their conversations lively, their memory sharp, and their thinking flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1921" data-end="2006"&gt;The key takeaway? Never stop learning—even if you’re the oldest person in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2013" data-end="2059"&gt;2. They challenge their memory on purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2061" data-end="2178"&gt;The brain thrives on friction. Sharp-minded seniors understand this, so they give their memory deliberate exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2180" data-end="2467"&gt;Crosswords, Sudoku, memory games, even something as basic as recalling a shopping list without writing it down—all these small challenges add up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2180" data-end="2467"&gt;Researchers emphasize that &lt;a href="https://www.sherringford.org/post/boost-your-brainpower-the-science-of-active-recall-retrieval-practice?.com"&gt;active recall&lt;/a&gt;—retrieving information from memory—fortifies neural pathways far more effectively than passive review. This phenomenon, known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect?.com"&gt;testing effect&lt;/a&gt;, is well-supported by decades of cognitive research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2469" data-end="2706"&gt;A friend of mine has a quirky daily ritual: he memorizes three phone numbers every morning, just to see if he can recall them by evening. Sounds trivial, right? But those small sparks of effort build resilience into his memory network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2940"&gt;And here’s the secret—memory exercises don’t have to be boring. They can come through song lyrics, trivia nights, or even trying to remember recipes without checking the book. The point isn’t perfection—it’s the act of stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2947" data-end="2986"&gt;3. They nurture strong social ties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2988" data-end="3190"&gt;Loneliness is one of the most dangerous threats to mental health. Not just emotionally—but cognitively. Multiple studies link isolation with faster cognitive decline and even higher risks of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3192" data-end="3394"&gt;The people who stay sharp into their 80s are usually the ones who make time for connection. They grab coffee with friends, join local walking groups, or volunteer where conversation naturally happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3396" data-end="3801"&gt;I once met a retired teacher in San Francisco who told me, “I don’t miss the job. I miss the staffroom debates.” To fill that gap, he started a weekly discussion group at his library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3396" data-end="3801"&gt;Every Thursday, ten or so people show up to talk about current events, books, and sometimes even conspiracy theories. He laughed when he said, “The best part is, I have to stay on my toes. Someone always challenges me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3803" data-end="3884"&gt;That mental engagement—listening, arguing, adapting—acts as fuel for his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3891" data-end="3921"&gt;4. They move their bodies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3923" data-end="4210"&gt;It’s impossible to separate brain health from body health. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, improves mood, and supports memory. You don’t have to run marathons or deadlift huge weights to see the benefits. Even brisk walking, swimming, or yoga makes a measurable difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4212" data-end="4364"&gt;As noted in a landmark randomized controlled trial published in &lt;em data-start="64" data-end="70"&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, one year of &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1015950108?.com"&gt;moderate aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; increased the volume of the anterior hippocampus by around 2%, effectively reversing age-related loss by about 1–2 years—and significantly improved spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4366" data-end="4576"&gt;I’ve noticed it myself. If I fall out of my exercise routine, I get sluggish not just physically but mentally. Concentration feels harder. Ideas don’t flow as easily. Movement is brain fuel, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4578" data-end="4863"&gt;And some older adults make it fun. A woman I met in her 70s in Mexico City had joined a salsa dancing group. She admitted she wasn’t very good, but the combination of music, movement, and socializing lit her up. She said it made her feel “10 years younger.” Honestly, I believed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4870" data-end="4924"&gt;5. They embrace technology instead of avoiding it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4926" data-end="5124"&gt;Sharp older adults don’t hide from technology. They may not love every new gadget, but they lean in. Whether it’s texting, video calls, or exploring online forums, they adapt instead of resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5126" data-end="5405"&gt;I once helped my uncle set up a music streaming app. At first, he said, “This is too complicated.” But once he got the hang of it, he started curating playlists of his favorite 70s records and texting them to me. A month later, he was recommending bands I hadn’t even heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5407" data-end="5654"&gt;This openness doesn’t just keep older adults socially connected. It keeps their brains flexible. Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://psychology.tips/cognitive-flexibility/?.com"&gt;“cognitive flexibility”&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to switch between tasks and perspectives. And it’s a huge predictor of mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5656" data-end="5767"&gt;So while some shrug off new tech as unnecessary, the people who thrive embrace it as another chance to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5774" data-end="5807"&gt;6. They practice mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5809" data-end="5904"&gt;Mindfulness has gone from a trendy buzzword to a scientifically backed tool for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5906" data-end="6230"&gt;Meditation, mindful breathing, or simply slowing down to notice details in daily life helps reduce stress, sharpen attention, and improve memory. As Dr. Richard Davidson, founder of the Center for Healthy Minds, explains: “Attention is the building block of learning. If we strengthen attention, everything else improves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6469"&gt;Not every sharp older adult sits cross-legged chanting “om.” Some simply build small mindfulness rituals: writing down three things they’re grateful for, gardening slowly and attentively, or pausing for a few deep breaths before meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6471" data-end="6574"&gt;What matters is training the mind to focus. In a world of constant distraction, that ability is gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6581" data-end="6607"&gt;7. They stay creative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6609" data-end="6802"&gt;Creativity keeps the brain elastic. When you create—whether through painting, writing, carpentry, or playing music—you activate neural pathways that strengthen problem-solving and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6804" data-end="7040"&gt;When I visited Japan, I met an 80-something woman who wrote a haiku every morning. She didn’t call herself a poet. She just said, “It keeps my thoughts sharp.” And it showed—her mind was lively, her humor quick, her presence magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7042" data-end="7316"&gt;This is a pattern I’ve seen over and over again. The act of creating—not the quality of the output—is what matters. You don’t have to be Picasso. Doodling, journaling, even building a birdhouse counts. Creativity is less about talent and more about staying mentally agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7323" data-end="7357"&gt;8. They prioritize good sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7359" data-end="7430"&gt;Here’s a subtle truth: sharp older adults guard their sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7432" data-end="7630"&gt;Sleep isn’t wasted time. It’s when the brain consolidates memories and clears out toxins that build up during the day. Poor sleep is linked to worse focus, weaker memory, and higher dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7632" data-end="7830"&gt;The sharpest people I know in their 70s and 80s take sleep seriously. They keep regular schedules, avoid late caffeine, and often have wind-down rituals like reading or listening to calming music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7832" data-end="8019"&gt;One man told me he uses a simple rule: no screens after 9 p.m. “If I don’t see the news cycle,” he said, “my brain actually rests.” He swore it was his secret to waking up with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8026" data-end="8078"&gt;9. They stay curious about people and the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8080" data-end="8128"&gt;This might be the most important habit of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8130" data-end="8341"&gt;The people who stay sharp don’t shrink their world down to nostalgia or routine. They keep asking questions. They talk to younger people. They pay attention to culture, politics, technology, and human stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8343" data-end="8529"&gt;Curiosity fuels growth. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “At a child’s birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift should be curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8531" data-end="8753"&gt;Sharp older adults never stop exercising that gift. They don’t just tell stories from the past—they want to know what’s happening now, and what’s coming next. That openness keeps them alert, engaged, and mentally strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8760" data-end="8780"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8782" data-end="8909"&gt;Mental sharpness into old age isn’t an accident. It’s the result of deliberate choices—small habits that add up over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8911" data-end="9055"&gt;From learning new things and challenging their memory, to moving their bodies and staying curious, these practices are available to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An illuminating video has captured in alarming detail exactly what happens to the body after catching the plague. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medieval illness—one of the most deadly in history—ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1351 and killed tens of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of the condition, dubbed the black death, today are rare, with modern antibiotics drastically reducing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But officials were alarmed last week after an unidentified adult in the US tested positive for the plague and was recovering at home after receiving medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed an infected flea bit the patient, who was camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. No other information on their condition was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the minute-long &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BH8y7Pmq-g"&gt;YouTube video published&lt;/a&gt; by Zack D. Films—who boasts 23 million subscribers—has shown how the bacterial infection passes through the body and affects different limbs, without any treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you got bitten by a flea, a bacterium would enter your body and begin to multiply quickly,' it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They would head to your lymph nodes, causing them to swell up and forming painful bumps in your armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The video simulation shows in gruesome detail what happens to the body once it is infected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A person living near Lake Tahoe (pictured) tested positive for the plague (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is carried by fleas and transmitted between animals. The picture above is a 3D illustration of the bacterium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The bacteria can also get into your bloodstream, causing bleeding under your skin. This bleeding makes your skin turn dark and black in certain spots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simulation then shows the person's finger tips becoming black before spreading slowly across the limbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left untreated, the infection can ravage enters the bloodstream and travels to the lungs, causing deadly infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the disease enters cells, it kills them by releasing deadly toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reacting to the video, users expressed their shock at how quickly the infection spreads.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why I'm grateful to have been born in this era. Where medicine and science are advanced enough to handle situations like this,' one wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show there have been no cases of the plague found in the UK since 1918.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of an infected person returning to Britain from abroad is low, the agency says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It still occurs in several countries in Africa, Asia, South America and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the US &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;recorded their first plague death&lt;/a&gt; since 2007, in Arizona.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are three forms of the plague: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the most common is the bubonic plague, named after 'buboes', the painful swollen bumps the infection causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms that develop one to seven days after infection include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, fatigue, weakness, vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;As annoying as catching a cold may be, there could be a silver lining. New research suggests that it may temporarily protect you from getting covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers revealed that individuals, especially children, who had recently been infected by a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rhinoviruses/about/index.html"&gt;rhinovirus&lt;/a&gt;—the most frequent culprit behind the common cold—were remarkably less likely to get a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes covid-19, in the following weeks. These results might shed light onto why children have lower chances of developing covid symptoms than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An ‘early advantage’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold,” Max Seibold, Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health, said in a National Jewish Health &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/about-us/news/press-releases/2025-news/common-cold-may-protect-against-covid-19#:~:text=DENVER%20%2D%20A%20new%20study%20led,virus%20that%20causes%20COVID%2D19."&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seibold and his colleagues detailed their results in a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf374/8230147?login=true"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, after analyzing data that tracked over 4,100 people in 1,394 households from May 2020 to February 2021. They tested thousands of self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, such as rhinovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Built-in boost&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhinoviruses trigger &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/interferon"&gt;interferons&lt;/a&gt;—natural agents that fight against infection and diseases—in our airways. This reaction can give the immune system a temporary boost, leaving it better equipped to handle other viruses that show up. In fact, to further investigate how recent viral infections impact the body’s antiviral defenses, the team also studied gene &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Gene-Expression"&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt; (when genetic information is translated into a function) in people’s airways and found children had a higher baseline expression of genes related to interferons than adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Based on these findings, we hypothesize that interferons induced by prior viral respiratory infections may prime the airways of children with high levels of antiviral defense proteins, resulting in reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and better clinical outcomes compared to adults,” the researchers explained in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, “has been observed for other respiratory viruses, but has yet to be demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2,” the scientists added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Camille Moore, lead author of the study and a biostatistician at National Jewish Health, explained that “understanding how one virus can affect the body’s response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations,” she said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moore also clarifies that this doesn’t mean people should start trying to catch a cold. And if you think that’s an obvious warning, you clearly don’t know humans very well.&lt;/p&gt;

And because its code is so different, it is less likely to mix with natural organisms, easing safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This breakthrough could also pave the way for new medicines, advanced materials and synthetic lifeforms beyond anything seen in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The microbe, named Syn57, is a lab-engineered version of Escherichia coli, a bacterium that can naturally cause infections in the gut, urinary tract and other areas of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To tackle this huge project, scientists divided the genome into 38 pieces, each about 100,000 DNA letters long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They built each piece in yeast and then inserted it into E coli using a method called uREXER, which combines CRISPR-Cas9 and other tools to swap in synthetic DNA in one step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some genome regions slowed growth or resisted changes, but the team solved these issues by adjusting gene sequences, untangling overlapping genes, and carefully choosing which codons to swap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Step by step, the fragments were stitched together into the final, fully synthetic bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The result, Syn57, is the most heavily redesigned organism ever made, demonstrating that life can survive with a much smaller, simpler genetic code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wesley Robertson, a synthetic biologist at the Medical Research Council Laboratory in the UK, told the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/science/dna-genetics-engineering-microbes.html"&gt; New York Times&lt;/a&gt;: 'We definitely went through these periods where we were like, 'Well, will this be a dead end, or can we see this through?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57 is alive, but barely. While normal E. coli can double in an hour, Syn57 takes four, making it 'extremely feeble,' Yonatan Chemla, a synthetic biologist at MIT who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria grew on a jelly-like surface and in a nutritious liquid, but at four times slower than their natural counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robertson and his team are now experimenting to see if they can make it grow faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If successful, scientists could eventually program it to do tasks that ordinary bacteria cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the 20 standard amino acids that all life uses to make proteins, chemists can create hundreds of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57's seven missing codons could potentially be reassigned to these unnatural amino acids, allowing the bacterium to produce new drugs or other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57 could also make engineered microbes safer for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microbes swap genes easily, which can be risky if engineered DNA spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a gene from Syn57 would be gibberish to natural bacteria because of its unique genetic code, preventing it from being used outside the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:19:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRWpWNG9SZ3pZMHBJalJoZ3lUOHBhMlRCOWs2cTFzQmdTR1BpdjFWMUpkZld1VjlnT2NMQXdlbVJqWmpuUFFyNDdMdFIwSVpFTG56YjBha0NjQlpHTE8wdDc2dWF0eGdrZVktX2RiLXdJR3Z4X0dsV25VamlQWkhmaFMxSnFHR2JHa2lqTGVySl9GaFJQdTdRY3VsWmllb1pVVVRUb2VTZWN1NWM</guid></item><item><title>当你喝丁香水时，你的血糖会发生什么？ - Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-cloves-help-lower-blood-sugar-and-inflammation-11795846</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway_1-0" class="comp health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway health-sc-block-callout-base mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-key-takeaway theme-key-takeaway" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cloves contain eugenol, a plant compound known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities. Some early studies suggest that eugenol may help regulate glucose metabolism by lowering glucose levels, improving cholesterol, and protecting the liver and kidneys from damage caused by high blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661820316236" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, experts are not convinced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's definitely a stretch to say that chewing on a clove or drinking water that cloves had been in would give you the same benefits as some of the components that are in the cloves themselves,” &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/julie-stefanski" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julie Stefanski MEd, RDN, LDN,&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although cloves contain antioxidants that help neutralize harmful molecules called free radicals, they’re not necessarily the best option for lowering inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-research-actually-shows-about-cloves"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Research Actually Shows About Cloves &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most existing research has been conducted on animals or in vitro with high concentrations of cloves, not with clove water or the whole spice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While one small, preliminary human trial demonstrated a slight drop in blood sugar compared to a placebo, the difference wasn’t enough to be considered clinically significant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, in another study in 2019, people with and without diabetes who took 250 mg of clove extract daily for 30 days showed &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/naturally-lower-blood-sugar-6830134" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significantly lower blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, given that most studies used concentrated extracts, it’s doubtful that drinking clove water or chewing on cloves will affect blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More research into clove water is necessary to understand the potential health benefits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a healthy adult, drinking clove water or chewing on cloves is not likely to cause any health problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Think of cloves as a flavorful bonus, not a magic fix,” said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/grace-a-derocha" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Grace Derocha, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At higher concentrations—especially as an oil—cloves can pose serious health risks to the liver and kidneys, increase bleeding, and cause seizures or a coma.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s especially toxic for children. The smallest amount could result in seizures and liver damage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pregnant and breastfeeding people should also be cautious since there isn’t enough data on how cloves or clove oil may affect them. However, the real danger is using clove water or cloves to replace reliable, proper medical care.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plenty of natural, delicious food choices are packed with benefits that can help reduce inflammation and support healthy blood sugar levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Clove water might give you antioxidants and a nice flavor, but the real benefits for blood sugar and inflammation come from whole foods we know are backed by research,” said Derocha.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some examples of healthy, science-backed choices include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy vegetables loaded with fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Foods like kale and broccoli help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antioxidant-packed berries:&lt;/strong&gt; Berries fight inflammation and support overall metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;These provide the fiber needed to steady blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-with-more-omega-3-than-sardines-11745099" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 rich foods&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds help lower inflammation in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A Mediterranean-style eating plan, which emphasizes vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins, has the strongest evidence for supporting blood sugar control and lowering inflammation long-term,” added Derocha.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Following a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; comprehensive review of the latest research on hypertension, b&lt;/span&gt;lood pressure guidelines in the US have been updated to cut risks of heart disease and dementia later in life further than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The updated guidelines replace a previous revision &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-change-what-high-blood-pressure-hypertension-is"&gt;conducted in 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and are a joint effort from the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and other respected institutions in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes are modifications to existing recommendations for healthcare professionals, targeting individuals who already fall into risk categories, have relevant medical conditions, or are pregnant. Though in their entirety, the recommendations remain relevant to everybody, regardless of their current state of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-common-blood-pressure-drug-extends-lifespan-slows-aging-in-animals"&gt;This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan, Slows Aging in Animals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One innovative tool introduced in the updated guidelines is the PREVENT (Predicting Risk of CVD Events) score; a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-weekend-habit-may-cut-risk-of-heart-related-death-by-33-study-finds"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; calculator based on data from 3.2 million diverse individuals collected between 1992 and 2022. The score is expected to help assess risk for a broader range of potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-dementia-linked-to-brain-abnormalities-from-high-blood-pressure"&gt;continues to grow&lt;/a&gt; that high blood pressure puts individuals at an increased risk of cardiovascular and neurological diseases, not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;potential problems&lt;/a&gt; with the kidneys, the eyes, and the body's metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High blood pressure is the most prevalent and modifiable risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and all-cause mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the newly issued guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings"&gt;Blood pressure readings&lt;/a&gt; tell you the pressure of your blood against the walls of your arteries.

Stage 1 is classed as 130-139 mm Hg systolic, or 80-89 mm Hg diastolic; anything above that in either figure is stage 2. When you get to above 180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic, you need to call your doctor right away, or the emergency services if you've got symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; or shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you hit &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, the guidelines say, a doctor may need to prescribe medication. In Europe, treatments usually don't begin until the 140/90 mm Hg threshold is reached, unless other health factors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overarching blood pressure treatment goal is &amp;lt;130/80 mm Hg for all adults, with additional considerations for those who require institutional care, have a limited predicted lifespan, or are pregnant," the guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifestyle recommendations are unchanged, and apply to everyone: keep up the exercise, eat a healthy diet relatively low in sodium, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-suggests-even-moderate-drinking-is-linked-with-brain-damage"&gt;drink alcohol in moderation&lt;/a&gt; (if at all), and manage your stress levels to reduce blood pressure. Even better, check in with friends and family too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians should collaborate with community leaders, health systems, and practices to implement screening of all adults in their communities and implement guideline-based recommendations regarding prevention and management of high blood pressure to improve rates of blood pressure control," the guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypertension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						UC Davis Medical Center will soon become the first special pathogen treatment center in Northern California. The new classification, known as National Special Pathogens System (NSPS) Level 2, means the hospital will be able to treat patients infected with contagious infectious diseases like Ebola and the Marburg virus. UC Davis said the new classification is thanks to $1.2 million in funding from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). That funding will be used for maintenance of airborne infection isolation rooms, investment in specialized equipment and enhanced training for medical staff.  "Designing care for patients with highly contagious pathogens requires a fundamentally different approach," said Christian Sandrock, director of critical care at UC Davis, in a news release. "We’re building a parallel system — one that allows us to respond swiftly while keeping patients, health care workers and the broader community safe."There are four NSPS facility levels in a tiered system for caring for patients. Level two facilities can provide specialized care to clusters of patients with "high-consequence infectious diseases" and be a primary center for care for the full period of illness. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles is a Level 1 NSPS hospital. That facility will partner with UC Davis to help develop preparedness and response capabilities, according to the release. "CDPH will support UC Davis Medical Center in becoming a Special Pathogen Treatment Center, the second center that can serve statewide and the first in Northern California providing specialized assessment and treatment for California residents,” said CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Erica Pan.

						&lt;strong class="dateline"&gt;SACRAMENTO, Calif. —&lt;/strong&gt; 													&lt;p&gt;UC Davis Medical Center will soon become the first special pathogen treatment center in Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new classification, known as National Special Pathogens System (NSPS) Level 2, means the hospital will be able to treat patients infected with contagious infectious diseases like Ebola and the Marburg virus. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not a milk drinker? Not a problem. There are still expert-approved ways to get calcium in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's crucial to get enough calcium, because it's essential for bone health. The mineral makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. It's also important for muscle function and nerve signaling, registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Meggie Connelly&lt;/a&gt; told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults, the NIH recommends about 1,000 to 1,200 mg of calcium daily — but, dairy milk isn't the only way to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other dairy products like yogurt and cheese also contain calcium, as do non-dairy milks fortified with calcium, Connelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu made with calcium is another way to get both the bone-supporting mineral plus protein. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other calcium-fortified options include fruit juices and cereals, the NIH adds. For example, the NIH estimates one cup of orange juice fortified with calcium provides the same amount of calcium (about 27% of your daily value) as 8 ounces of low fat yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one cup of nonfat milk is about the same as an equal serving of calcium-fortified soy milk, according to the institute's estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of &lt;a href="http://www.drnutritionchanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Nutrition Changer&lt;/a&gt;, said canned fish with bones, like salmon or sardines, also provide calcium. And, you can even get it from some vegetables, Jiang added, like kale, broccoli and bok choy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know where you stand with your calcium intake, Connelly said if your plate looks colorful and balanced most of the time (think, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, proteins, dairy or calcium-fortified plant milks), "you're probably in a good place."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, some people can still fall short on nutrients like calcium, vitamin D and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/red-meat-iron-sources-food-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; despite balanced meals — "especially for women, those with certain health conditions or plant-based eaters," Connelly added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're worried about your calcium levels, experts suggested consulting your doctor about supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources," Jiang said. "This helps us get the most benefits of all sorts of nutrients while minimizing the risk of overconsumption."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;You’d assume that a medicine you can buy without a prescription at any pharmacy, big-box retailer, or grocery store is completely safe, right? But as more research comes out, we’re learning that over-the-counter (OTC) drugs can come with a long list of potentially &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/antacids-ppis-migraines/" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous side effects&lt;/a&gt;. The latest such study shows that two very popular and very common pain meds may be fueling antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/tylenol-dangerous-otc-drug/" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Warn This Popular Med Is “The Most Dangerous OTC Drug.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the deal with antibiotic resistance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change and no longer respond to antibiotic medicines, making certain bacterial infections difficult or impossible to treat, as &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Cleveland Clinic: Antibiotic Resistance" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21655-antibiotic-resistance" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains. The most common reason for this is the overuse of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 scientific article published in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="StatPearls: Antibiotic Resistance" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513277/" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;StatPearls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “In 2015, 30 percent of the outpatient antibiotics prescribed were unnecessary, with acute respiratory infections holding the highest unnecessary use of antibiotics at 50 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly speaking, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to all instances in which bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites stop responding to medicines such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="WHO: Antimicrobial Resistance" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) estimates that “bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/tums-heart-problems/" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Warn These OTC Antacids Can Put Your Heart in Danger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scientists are also concerned about antibiotic resistance caused by other types of medications.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study, published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Nature: The effect of commonly used non-antibiotic medications on antimicrobial resistance development in Escherichia coli" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00144-w" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, took a closer look at how non-antibiotic medications may contribute to antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were especially concerned about the effects in residential aged care facilities, where patients are frequently given both antibiotics and non-antibiotic medications, including those for pain, sleep, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To arrive at their findings, the scientists from the University of South Australia (UniSA) investigated the effects of nine common non-antibiotic medications on the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; (E. coli):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen (Advil, an anti-inflammatory pain reliever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diclofenac (Voltaren, an anti-inflammatory pain reliever used to treat arthritis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acetaminophen (Tylenol, a drug to treat pain and fever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furosemide (a blood pressure-lowering drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metformin (a common diabetes drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atorvastatin (Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tramadol (an opioid pain drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temazepam (Restoril, a sleeping pill)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed, a decongestant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. coli most commonly causes gut (GI tract) infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is treated with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/calcium-heart-attack-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;Taking Too Much of This Supplement Can Hurt Your Heart, Doctors Warn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research shows that Tylenol and Advil can contribute to antibiotic resistance.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers had their data, they employed whole-genome sequencing, a technology that determines the exact order of DNA in a human’s genome and can pinpoint genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that, of the nine medications, the two common OTC pain meds, Advil and Tylenol, drive antibiotic resistance when used individually and further amplify it when used together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and paracetamol, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant,” said lead researcher &lt;strong&gt;Rietie Venter&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/rietie.venter" target="_blank"&gt;associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at UniSA, in a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095896" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes,” she continued. “We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria’s defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venter explains that the research isn’t advocating for people to stop using Advil and Tylenol, but rather to be more mindful of how much they’re taking or prescribing and with what antibiotics. She and her team are planning further research into drug interactions and antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians agree that the healthiest yogurt should be low in added sugar, high in protein, and contain live active cultures for gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siggi’s Icelandic yogurt is their top pick, offering simple ingredients, minimal added sugar, and about 16 grams of protein per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beyond dairy options, Siggi’s also makes non-dairy yogurts with coconut milk and pea protein, providing a lower-sugar, probiotic-rich choice for plant-based eaters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as nutritional content goes, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/unexpected-add-in-turns-yogurt-into-fancy-treat-11780307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to offer. Not only does it provide gut-friendly probiotics, but it contains satiating protein and bone-supporting minerals too. Yogurt can also serve as a base for nutritious recipes, whether you’re making&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-fruit-smoothie-recipes-7375286" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; fruit smoothies&lt;/a&gt; or simple&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/yogurt-dip-with-herb-oil-recipe-7108449" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; herb dips&lt;/a&gt;. But with &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;many brands of yogurt to choose from, shopping for the ingredient can be overwhelming. When nutrition is your top priority, what should you look for when buying yogurt? And which brand stands out above the rest? To find out, we asked three dietitians to share their top pick for the healthiest yogurt brand, according to their expertise.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Minimal Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you want to choose the healthiest type [of yogurt], my go-to advice is to look at the amount of&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/how-much-sugar-a-day" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; added sugar&lt;/a&gt;,” says registered dietitian Emer Delaney, RD. This is especially important for low-fat or reduced-calorie yogurts, which are made by replacing fat with sugar, per Delaney. This ensures the final product still tastes good. Registered dietitian Samantha Peterson, MS, RD, echoes this notion, sharing that many flavored yogurts can sneak in more sugar than a dessert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thus, if you’d like to lose weight, control your blood sugar, or build muscle, it’s worth paying attention to the amount of added sugar in your yogurt (and your overall diet), notes Delaney. Look for a yogurt with six to eight grams of added sugar per serving, advises Peterson. You can also opt for plain yogurt, then add sweeteners like date syrup or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/honey-maple-syrup-better-sugar" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt;, starting at one to two teaspoons, she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Protein Content &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A good yogurt should keep you satisfied for a few hours, notes Peterson. This is primarily due to&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/complete-protein-foods-6891861" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; protein&lt;/a&gt;, an essential nutrient that supports satiety and reduces hunger. So, choose a yogurt that has at least 10 grams of protein per serving, suggests registered dietitian Elizabeth Pecoraro, MS, RDN, LD. While you’re at it, pick &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/greek-yogurt-vs-cottage-cheese-11767885" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; or Icelandic yogurt, if possible. These styles tend to have more protein than regular varieties, according to Peterson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Live and Active Cultures &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These beneficial bacteria support a healthy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which can &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-with-digestion-8680191" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improve digestion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;immune health&lt;/a&gt;, and even mood,” shares Peterson. To ensure your yogurt contains these&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/what-is-a-probiotic" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, check the container for the “Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures” seal or specific strains like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt;, notes Pecoraro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Personal Needs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ultimately, the healthiest choice depends on your personal needs,” says Delaney. For example, if you’re trying to build muscle and lose weight, pick a yogurt that’s higher in protein to help control your appetite and support muscle growth, she explains. Or, if you’d like to control your blood sugar levels, “go for the unsweetened or low-sugar options and add some fruit for natural sweetness or a bit of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cinnamon-recipes-8403727" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; for extra flavor,” advises Delaney. Finally, “if you’re vegan or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/cheese-can-eat-lactose-intolerant" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lactose-intolerant&lt;/a&gt;, fortified plant-based yogurts are going to be your best fit,” Delaney adds. Examples include almond, soy, or coconut yogurts, she points out. In this case, choose a product with added&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/high-calcium-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; calcium&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-vitamin-d-8781864" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, as some plant-based yogurts are naturally lower in these nutrients than those made with cow’s milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Siggi’s&lt;/strong&gt; wins first place as the healthiest yogurt brand, according to all three dietitians. Overall, the brand checks the boxes mentioned earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only do Siggi’s Icelandic yogurts boast simple ingredients lists, but nearly every variety is low in added sugar, Pecoraro points out. “While some of their flavored options do have added sugar, it’s minimal compared to typical fruit-on-the-bottom brands,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, at 16 grams of protein per serving, “it’s a great snack &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-eat-after-a-workout-8681539" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;after your workout&lt;/a&gt; or a brilliant addition to your meals to help increase your protein intake,” Delaney says. Siggi’s also provides calcium and vitamin B12, which support &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-bone-health-7495764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and energy production, respectively, Peterson notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But that’s not all: Siggi’s yogurts contain live bacteria, including &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/em&gt;, which means it’s great for your gut health, according to Delaney. Peterson agrees, sharing that “the live, active cultures feed your gut’s ‘good’ bacteria, which support digestion and overall gut balance.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, Siggi’s&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-dairy-non-dairy-yogurts-study-7514830" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; non-dairy yogurts&lt;/a&gt; are made with &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/coconut-milk" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coconut milk&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;lower in sugar than many other plant-based brands, shares Pecoraro. These varieties contain added protein (in the form of pea protein) and live cultures as well.

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study involving DNA analysis of Beethoven’s remains has provided fresh insights into the composer’s health, genetic lineage, and possible causes behind his legendary hearing loss. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study, led by biochemist Johannes Krause at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, explored Beethoven’s genetic makeup in an effort to uncover the mysteries of his declining health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beethoven’s Health and Genetic Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s health &lt;/strong&gt;has long been a subject of fascination for historians, biographers, and medical experts alike. Most famously, the composer experienced progressive &lt;strong&gt;hearing loss &lt;/strong&gt;starting in his mid-to-late twenties, eventually becoming functionally deaf by 1818. The loss of his hearing didn’t stop him from composing some of the world’s most iconic music, but it did raise questions about the causes behind this condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/983032" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a press statement released in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, biochemist &lt;strong&gt;Johannes Krause&lt;/strong&gt; noted, “Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethoven’s health problems, which famously include progressive hearing loss, beginning in his mid- to late-20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818.” The research team hoped to identify genetic factors that could explain these conditions, but Krause admitted that they were unable to find a definitive cause for Beethoven’s hearing loss or his gastrointestinal problems, which he struggled with throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of a clear answer, the study’s findings offer a glimpse into the&lt;strong&gt; genetic makeup&lt;/strong&gt; of one of history’s most influential composers, adding another layer to the understanding of his extraordinary life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Insights into Beethoven’s Family Lineage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study didn’t find conclusive evidence linking &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s deafness to a genetic disorder&lt;/strong&gt;, it did provide a fascinating look at his family’s genetic history. One of the most intriguing findings from the research was the revelation of a genetic event that occurred in Beethoven’s paternal line several generations before his birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tristan Begg&lt;/strong&gt;, a biological anthropologist involved in the study, explained, “This finding suggests an extrapair paternity event in his paternal line between the conception of&lt;strong&gt; Hendrik van Beethoven in Kampenhout&lt;/strong&gt;, Belgium in c.1572 and the conception of &lt;strong&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven &lt;/strong&gt;seven generations later in 1770, in Bonn, Germany.” Essentially, the analysis indicated that an extramarital affair or affair involving Beethoven’s paternal ancestors could have contributed to a complex genetic heritage that stretches back centuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this finding doesn’t necessarily offer direct insights into &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s health issues&lt;/strong&gt;, it sheds light on the potential genetic diversity within his family. Understanding the genealogy of such a prominent historical figure adds nuance to our understanding of his life and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beethoven’s Genetic Markers and Health Complications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another crucial element of the research involved analyzing the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/genetic-evidence-leprosy-ancient-american/" data-type="post" data-id="84205"&gt; genetic markers&lt;/a&gt; related to diseases that could have affected&lt;strong&gt; Beethoven’s health&lt;/strong&gt;. The study looked at various genes associated with hearing loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and other ailments that the composer endured. Though the researchers didn’t identify a definitive cause for his hearing loss or chronic abdominal issues, they noted several genetic markers that could have contributed to his overall health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings support the hypothesis that Beethoven may have had a hereditary predisposition to certain health problems. It’s also possible that environmental factors, such as his diet, stress levels, or even infections, played a role in exacerbating his conditions. Unfortunately, the study did not uncover any clear genetic connection to&lt;strong&gt; Beethoven’s well-known health struggles&lt;/strong&gt;, but it provided valuable data for future research into genetic disorders of similar nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Intersection of Genetics and Artistry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research on &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s DNA &lt;/strong&gt;also highlights the fascinating intersection between genetics and creativity. Many have wondered how Beethoven, despite his worsening hearing loss, was able to continue composing music at the highest level. His ability to produce groundbreaking symphonies and piano concertos despite his deafness has been a source of inspiration for many.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study did not pinpoint a genetic factor that could explain Beethoven’s extraordinary artistic abilities, the sheer complexity of his genetic history raises intriguing possibilities. Could his lineage or certain genetic traits have contributed to his exceptional creativity and resilience in the face of adversity? These questions remain unanswered but serve as a reminder of the mysterious relationship between genetics, health, and talent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Legacy of Beethoven’s Health and Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study of &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s DNA &lt;/strong&gt;is just one part of a broader effort to understand the composer’s life, health, and legacy. While much is still unknown about the specific causes of his health issues, the research has contributed significantly to the ongoing dialogue surrounding Beethoven’s genius and struggles. The analysis also offers a glimpse into the broader field of genetic research on historical figures, shedding light on the possibilities and limitations of genetic analysis in understanding the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Even though the research team was unable to pinpoint a clear explanation for Beethoven’s health problems, the study has opened up new avenues for understanding the intersections of health, history, and genetics. In many ways, Beethoven’s health challenges are as enigmatic as his music, and this study provides a valuable step forward in unlocking the secrets of both.&lt;/p&gt;

Because this all-important organ filled with 86 billion neurons forms our experience, dysregulation within the brain has outsized impacts on someone’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, scientists have tried to find ways to stave off these negative effects and make a person’s healthspan largely match their ever-increasing &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65637132/immortality-singularity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lifespan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.

By analyzing how &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a35884787/humans-share-genes-with-weird-headless-creatures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; and proteins changed over time in mice, the team identified a troublesome protein named ferritin light chain 1, or FTL1. When scientists reduced the presence of this protein in the hippocampus, the mice regained some of their youthful characteristics, including improved nerve connections and better permorfance on memory tests. The results of the study were published &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00940-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65865756%2Faging-brain%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the journal Nature Aging;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the journal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments […]. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, a co-author of the study from UCSF, said &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in a press statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in a press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age.

When analyzing the effects of FTL1 protein in a petri dish, Villeda and his team discerned that nerve cells engineered simple, one armed neural wires—known as “neurites”—rather than the branching neurites typical of normal neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“To identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65583845/study-finds-reverse-aging-in-humans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; brain,” the authors wrote. “It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors also note that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms7760&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65865756%2Faging-brain%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2015 study;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;a 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; found that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively impacted cognitive performance and accurately predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/gaming/a14393872/video-games-prevent-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.

But with each new study, scientists work toward a holistic picture of neurodegenerative decline as we age, and with that new perspective comes the hope of new therapies that could make cognitive decline a thing of the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNUktTd3hMbGdTNFpwd1I4TDBSUDJYRzdDRERiSUdYeGxnTmRReU1tX2pjLTR2VmVzNmRxOTRnNS05Z0REUDhpaFBwbVlzbHNKUDVhWURfVDh2RUFYRm5jNmZvM3g5N2Fnb3ljVktLa1JLRE5pV0FTQ1FvVS1RVXdUc0d1NXo3VXV2d1pRLVRvN0k</guid></item><item><title>没有喝足够的水？您的压力荷尔蒙可能会过度驱动-研究发现</title><link>https://studyfinds.org/not-drinking-enough-water-stress/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adults who drank very little fluid daily (~1.3 L) had about 55% greater cortisol reactivity during a lab stress test compared to high drinkers (~4.4 L).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Heart rate and anxiety felt the same in both groups, but their hormonal stress systems behaved differently.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Urine color proved a simple indicator: darker urine (≥4 on an 8-point chart) signaled stronger cortisol spikes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Findings suggest that habitual low fluid intake may amplify the body’s stress response, possibly helping explain why poor hydration has been tied to health risks over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIVERPOOL, England —&lt;/strong&gt; Most of us already know that water is essential for staying healthy. But new research suggests that how much you drink each day could also affect how your body reacts to stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a lab experiment, young adults who typically drank less than a liter and a half of fluid per day had a much bigger spike in the stress hormone cortisol compared to those who drank closer to four liters. That’s about a 55 percent stronger &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;, just from differences in everyday drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cortisol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cortisol&lt;/a&gt; is the body’s main “stress chemical.” It helps us deal with challenges in the short term, but when it stays too high for too long, it can wear us down. That makes this study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00408.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a reminder that hydration may play a bigger role in long-term health than most people realize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-hydration-matters-for-stress"&gt;Why Hydration Matters for Stress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We usually think of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/doctors-notes-dehydration-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;being dehydrated&lt;/a&gt; in terms of feeling thirsty, tired, or having a headache. But inside the body, water balance is tied to hormones that do more than just keep fluids in check.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of them, &lt;em&gt;arginine vasopressin&lt;/em&gt; (AVP), helps the body save water when you’re running low. But AVP also has another side effect: it tells your body’s stress system to release more cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, when you’re habitually under-hydrated, the very system that responds to stress gets triggered more easily, leaving you prone to a bigger hormonal surge when life throws a challenge your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-study"&gt;Inside the Study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and collaborators recruited 62 healthy adults aged 18 to 35. Using national &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/nutrition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrition&lt;/a&gt; survey data, they identified two extremes of daily drinking habits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low fluid intake group&lt;/strong&gt;: averaging about 1.3 liters per day (just over five cups).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High fluid intake group&lt;/strong&gt;: averaging about 4.4 liters per day (roughly 18 cups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After screening, 32 participants (16 in each group) completed the experiment. For a week, they tracked exactly how much they drank, and researchers confirmed hydration status with urine tests. Then came the stressful part: the &lt;em&gt;Trier Social Stress Test&lt;/em&gt;, a well-established lab challenge involving a mock &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/job-interview-authenticity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;job interview&lt;/a&gt; and rapid-fire mental math performed in front of stony-faced observers and a video camera.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/spit-science-why-saliva-great-way-to-detect-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Saliva samples&lt;/a&gt; collected before, during, and after the test allowed researchers to track cortisol, while heart rate monitors and questionnaires measured anxiety and physical arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-they-found"&gt;What They Found&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the surface, both groups reacted similarly: their hearts raced, and they reported feeling more anxious. But under the hood, their hormones told a different story. In the low drinker group, cortisol levels spiked and stayed high even after the stressful tasks ended. In the high drinker group, cortisol barely rose above baseline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On average, the low drinkers showed a 55 percent bigger cortisol jump. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These novel findings show greater cortisol reactivity to acute psychosocial stress in adults with habitual low fluid intake and suboptimal hydration,” the study notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-simple-way-to-gauge-your-dehydration-risk"&gt;A Simple Way to Gauge Your Dehydration Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at practical indicators of hydration that everyday people can check without lab equipment. One of the simplest? &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/why-urine-is-yellow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Urine color&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using a standard eight-point chart, they found that participants with darker urine (levels 4 or higher) had stronger cortisol responses than those with lighter urine. Put simply: if your pee is regularly dark yellow in the morning, your body might also be primed for a sharper stress surge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab tests of urine concentration confirmed the same trend: more concentrated urine went hand in hand with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/monday-anxiety-may-leave-biological-mark-stress-cortisol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bigger cortisol spikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters-for-long-term-health"&gt;Why This Matters for Long-Term Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cortisol isn’t always bad. In short bursts, it helps us mobilize energy, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sharpen focus&lt;/a&gt;, and respond to challenges. But when levels stay high too often thanks to chronic stress, poor sleep, or perhaps inadequate hydration, the consequences can add up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elevated cortisol has been linked to weakened immune defenses, higher inflammation, and increased risk for conditions like cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have already found that people who don’t drink enough water face higher risks of kidney problems, heart issues, and metabolic disease. This new work provides a plausible mechanism: by ramping up the body’s stress response, habitual low fluid intake may nudge people onto a path toward poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-water-is-enough"&gt;How Much Water Is Enough?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Guidelines generally recommend about &lt;strong&gt;2.5 liters per day for men&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;2 liters for women&lt;/strong&gt;, including both drinks and the water naturally present in foods. Yet surveys show many adults fall short, especially those who rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/soda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soda&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; rather than plain water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The high-intake group in this study was well above those recommendations, while the low group was far below. That doesn’t mean everyone should chug four liters a day, but it does underscore the importance of meeting basic fluid needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-few-caveats"&gt;A Few Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has its limitations. It compared only the highest and lowest drinkers, leaving out people with moderate intake. The design was cross-sectional, meaning it can’t prove that drinking more water will reduce stress responses—only that the two are linked. And the stress test, while reliable, takes place in a controlled lab; real-world stress is messier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the findings are compelling. With just 32 participants, the researchers found a clear, consistent pattern across different measures of hydration. It’s also the first study to connect everyday drinking habits to the way the body’s stress system behaves under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bottom-line-stay-hydrated"&gt;The Bottom Line: Stay Hydrated!&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you needed another reason to reach &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/drinking-water/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for a glass of water,&lt;/a&gt; here it is. Staying hydrated might not only help you feel sharper and more energetic, it could also make your body’s stress system less reactive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean water is a magic bullet. But in a world where stress &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;is hard to avoid&lt;/a&gt;, something as simple as paying attention to your daily fluid intake and the color of your urine might give you a little extra resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As small daily habits add up, the choice between a parched system primed for stress and a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hydration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;well-hydrated body&lt;/a&gt; ready to cope may be more important than most of us realize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. The study was relatively small and observational, meaning it shows associations but cannot prove cause and effect. If you have questions about hydration, stress, or your health, consult a qualified healthcare professional before making changes to your daily habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers recruited 62 healthy adults aged 18-35 and used national database quartiles to identify individuals with habitually low fluid intake (under 1.6 L/day for men, 1.5 L/day for women) and high fluid intake (over 2.9 L/day for men, 2.5 L/day for women). After screening, 32 participants completed the study (16 in each group). Participants tracked their fluid intake for seven days using validated methods and collected urine samples to confirm hydration status. They then underwent the Trier Social Stress Test, which involved a mock job interview and mental arithmetic tasks performed in front of observers. Researchers collected saliva samples at multiple time points to measure cortisol levels and monitored participants’ anxiety and heart rate responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The low fluid intake group showed significantly greater cortisol reactivity to stress, with levels remaining elevated at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the stress test, while the high intake group’s cortisol levels did not increase significantly above baseline. Cortisol reactivity measured 6.2 ± 2.9 nmol/L in the low group versus 4.0 ± 1.8 nmol/L in the high group. Hydration status, measured through urine concentration, showed a strong positive correlation (R = 0.7) with cortisol reactivity. Participants with darker urine color also demonstrated significantly higher cortisol responses to stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used a cross-sectional design that cannot establish causation between fluid intake and stress responses. Participants with moderate fluid intake levels were excluded by design, potentially limiting generalizability. The sample size was relatively small (32 participants), and the study did not examine long-term health outcomes. The researchers also noted that repeated stress testing would be difficult due to habituation effects, limiting the ability to conduct randomized controlled trials with the same stress protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool John Moores University received funding from Danone Research &amp;amp; Innovation to cover salary costs and data collection expenses. Several co-authors were current or former employees of Danone Research &amp;amp; Innovation, while the principal investigator reported no conflicts of interest directly relevant to the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-information"&gt;Publication Information&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study “Habitual fluid intake and hydration status influence cortisol reactivity to acute psychosocial stress” was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00408.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The research was conducted by D.S. Kashi, M. Hunter, J.P. Edwards, and colleagues from Liverpool John Moores University, Danone Research &amp;amp; Innovation, and ATLANSTAT. The clinical trial was registered as NCT05491122.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them can lead to severe or life-threatening illnesses, particularly for newborns and people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11d871" class="body-graf"&gt;Monitoring for the six pathogens is no longer required for the 10 states that participate in the program, though those states aren’t precluded from conducting surveillance on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-646ede" class="body-graf"&gt;Food safety experts worry that the move, which hasn’t previously been made public, could make it harder for public health officials to notice whether certain foodborne illnesses are rising and then slow response time to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82c2b1" class="body-graf"&gt;FoodNet is a collaboration among the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and 10 state health departments. Its surveillance area covers roughly 54 million people, or 16% of the U.S. population. The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and select counties in California and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-747166" class="body-graf"&gt;“Although FoodNet will narrow its focus to &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent,” the CDC spokesperson wrote. “Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3813e3" class="body-graf"&gt;A list of talking points the CDC provided to the Connecticut Public Health Department, viewed by NBC News, cites a reason for the change: “Funding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9263d" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC spokesperson said Monday that other systems conduct national surveillance for the six pathogens that were removed from FoodNet. For instance, state health departments are still able to report cases through the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt;. And the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/php/surveillance/listeria-initiative.html" target="_blank"&gt;Listeria Initiative&lt;/a&gt; collects reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis — serious infections from eating food contaminated with listeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1db3a" class="body-graf"&gt;But FoodNet is the only surveillance system that actively looks for multiple foodborne diseases at the federal level, according to food safety experts. Other federal surveillance systems are passive, meaning the CDC relies on state health departments to notify it of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aeeb8d" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts worry that without active surveillance of all eight pathogens, public health officials won’t be able to adequately compare trends over time or notice whether cases of a particular illness start rising. Experts also worry that scaling back FoodNet’s operations could make it harder to quickly identify and respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dfed0" class="body-graf"&gt;Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University, called the decision to reduce FoodNet surveillance “very disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-839248" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of the work that I and many, many, many, many other people have put into improving food safety over the past 20 or 30 years is just going away,” she said. Kowalcyk’s son died in 2001 of complications from a foodborne E. coli infection, and since then she has advocated for improvements to U.S. food safety policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2a792" class="body-graf"&gt;Kowalcyk said that the federal budget for food safety hasn’t kept up with the cost of inflation and that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trump-administrations-deep-cuts-to-public-health-leave-system-reeling" target="_blank"&gt;cuts to federal funding for state health departments&lt;/a&gt; have most likely made it harder to maintain FoodNet surveillance. The CDC requested a $72 million &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2026/fy-2026-cdc-cj.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;budget for food safety&lt;/a&gt; for the 2026 fiscal year, about the same as it has requested in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd6879" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not entirely clear how the changes to FoodNet are affecting surveillance on the state level so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-651cc4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Oregon and Connecticut health departments said they were aware of the changes as of Monday. Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Health Department said Friday that it hadn’t received any official notice from the CDC. And the New Mexico Health Department said it was awaiting notification from the CDC to determine the scope of its future surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-315df3" class="body-graf"&gt;The Maryland Health Department said the state’s health care providers and clinical laboratories are required to report cases of all eight pathogens monitored by FoodNet, so the reporting will continue “regardless of changes to the FoodNet network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4bdcd" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it will need to scale back active surveillance activities for some pathogens if funding is decreased in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:12:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOQVNudmwwVnZ1Tl9ZWjB4OUxvZHNFLWJxdW1PdGlnT2lIV1E2V1pZZ2E5Y25udS02Q01GQUZseGExdnZTcVYxUGdXRk1PT1A5emxJMWlaRFBncWpROGRyTFRZX3dOY3VEM0Q4MXB1NE0tRVdZU3FPWmp1UVl1c0lYdXZsaVptVEk1TEo1eGhjUnpzUUR5QXVpYjdhX3Z0SjhxdnB1OXdaZnNCUE04RmdlUHdSd0hsREtzVXfSAVZBVV95cUxPamdORWh6emFhcy1IR1EyX0NTRmxXNVJPMlY3X1FFYjFjNXc3bEJ3ZHhfVzNTMDF4aHBRXzlydUcwNzJ0a1BBNlpOempWQU40WmozS3hoQQ</guid></item><item><title>拉里默县居民死于西尼罗河病毒- KDVR</title><link>https://kdvr.com/news/local/larimer-county-resident-dies-from-west-nile-virus/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;
