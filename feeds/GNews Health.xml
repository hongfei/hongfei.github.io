	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UniQure&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=QURE" target="_blank"&gt;QURE&lt;/a&gt;) stock catapulted more than 200% Wednesday after the company said its experimental gene therapy successfully treated Huntington's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease is a neurological condition that slowly destroys brain cells, robbing patients of the ability to move and reason. But a high dose of UniQure's AMT-130 slowed disease progression by 75% after three years.&lt;/p&gt;

			
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sarah Tabrizi, director of the University College London Huntington's Disease Center, called the results "groundbreaking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These data are the most convincing in the field to date and underscore potential disease-modifying effects in Huntington's disease, where an urgent need persists," she said in a statement. "These data indicate that AMT-130 has the potential to meaningfully slow disease progression — offering long-awaited hope to individuals and families impacted by this devastating disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniQure stock launched 247.7% to 47.50. Shares touched a nearly five-year high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Game-Changing' Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniQure said patients who received the gene therapy showed a statistically significant improvement on the composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale, or cUHDRS. The scale was created to assess disease progression in early-to-moderate Huntington's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, patients showed decreased levels of neurofilament light chain in their cerebrospinal fluid after 36 months. Neurofilament light chain, or NfL, is a biomarker that indicates damage to the central nervous system. The gene therapy also continues to be well tolerated, UniQure said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is now planning to file an application for Food and Drug Administration approval in the first quarter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leerink Partners analyst Joseph Schwartz raised his price target on UniQure stock to 68 from 48 after the company held a call with Huntington's disease experts. He sees the data as "definitive" and the gene therapy as "clearly making a difference on progression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We think we will rapidly see excitement grow as one of the key leaders in HD described AMT-130 data on the call as 'game-changing,' offering a 'beacon of hope' for patients and their families, and representing a 'significant step toward delivering a licensed disease-modifying therapy for HD,' " he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwartz now sees an 85% chance AMT-130 wins FDA approval, and a 50% chance European regulators sign off on it.&lt;/p&gt;

Outside the United States, paracetamol is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250924054445/https:/www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/use-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-unchanged-eu" data-track="click" data-label="https://web.archive.org/web/20250924054445/https:/www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/use-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-unchanged-eu" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;still recommended&lt;/a&gt; as a first-line treatment for pain and fever in pregnancy, and scientists say there have been no causal associations between the drug and neurodevelopmental disorders. Untreated pain and fever, on the other hand, can harm mothers and fetuses&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol is one of the safest medicines available, with very few possible complications “as long as you stick to the [recommended] doses”, says Tony Dickenson, a neuroscientist at University College London. The drug is far more lethal in animals with different liver enzymes — such as snakes. That’s why in 2013 the United States airdropped thousands of paracetamol-laden dead mice to control invasive populations of brown tree snakes on the Pacific Island of Guam. Here’s what we do and don’t know about the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mysterious mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of clinical use, and the proposal of several molecular mechanisms, researchers still don’t fully know how paracetamol dulls pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research on paracetamol has been directed to what happens inside the brain, says Dickenson. “Paracetamol, apart from being an analgesic, is pretty good at reducing fevers,” he says. That’s controlled by the brain’s hypothalamus. “So, the drug is clearly getting into the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03116-2/d41586-025-03116-2_51426444.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Autism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This action on the central nervous system — protected behind the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01569-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01569-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;blood–brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; — makes paracetamol different to other, anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen and aspirin, which tend to work at the peripheral site of tissue damage. Studies also suggest the drug acts on neuronal pathways between the brain and the spinal cord that alter the gain of pain signalling&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “There are multiple systems and all of those are critical for pain processing,” says Dickenson. “So, it is pretty difficult to tease out what's going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence suggests that the drug can also act on neurons in the body that detect harmful stimuli — called nociceptors — in a similar way to a local anaesthetic&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were very surprised,” says study co-author Avi Priel, a pain pharmacologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “We showed that it had some peripheral effect directly on the pain system.” Still, the findings cannot explain the drug’s effect on temperature, so it’s possible that pain and fever relief are controlled by different systems, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking a look inside the human body has never been easier — just swallow a camera in the shape of a pill. However, what is not quite as easy is retrieving a piece of whatever you’re viewing. This is exactly what researchers from HIT Shenzhen have attempted to solve with &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/swallowable-robotic-pill-gut-health?utm_source=homepage&amp;amp;utm_medium=hero&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2025-09-21&amp;amp;utm_content=hero6" target="_blank"&gt;their magnetic capsule bot.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traditional procedures want to take a sample somewhere in the intestinal tract they generally require somewhat invasive procedures sticking something up…well you know. With this pill, robot magnetic control allows physicians to choose exactly where and when to take a sample, all without shoving unpleasant objects into…again you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnetic field is generated to open the capsule and suck liquids inside. This traps a sample that can be retrieved through later bowel movements. The technology hasn’t been tested on a living patient yet, but but animal trials are planned for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the fine details with the &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922091" target="_blank"&gt;paper itself here.&lt;/a&gt; Biomedical engineering is always an interesting topic with so much potential for more hacking. We at Hackaday are no strangers to this wonderful &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/02/09/better-living-through-biomedical-engineering/"&gt;world of bodily hacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Exercise modulates inflammatory pathways, reducing markers like CRP and IL-6.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotection:&lt;/strong&gt; “Physical activity increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), supporting neuronal health and cognitive function, essential for reducing dementia risk and maintaining mental acuity,” Patel says. Translation: it’s good for your brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can exercise ever be harmful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all finished a run and felt like an eighty-year-old whose knees and lungs are crumbling. Is that still an indicator of health? There’s a joke among some athletes—particularly climbers—that your chosen sport advances you ahead of other people. Not in fitness, but in age, with wrists, backs, ankles, elbows all feeling the strain of repetitive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a paradox,” says Patel. “Exercise itself triggers inflammation, and chronic inflammation is a fast-track to aging.” The key is to find the Goldilocks spot—the just-right amount that stimulates adaptation without excessive wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is meant to cause some muscle damage. It’s how we get stronger, and inflammation is the process by which the damaged areas are sent all of the building materials they need to repair themselves and are protected while this happens. But you’ve probably heard that inflammation is bad, leading to all sorts of worrying things, including cancer. So what’s the solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you know if you’re hitting the Goldilocks zone?” asks Patel. There are a few ways. You can get a kit to track your biological age, and dial back your workouts if the results are concerning. You can also track heart rate variability, with low HRV indicating poor recovery. &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/vo2-max-1"&gt;Tracking your VO2 Max&lt;/a&gt;—a test of the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise—works in the same way. Patel calls it “the ultimate predictor of longevity, indicating cardiorespiratory fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your levels in any of these tests are higher than you’d like, scale it back. For best results, you might work with a physiologist to find out what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whittaker has a final hack: sleep. “It’s the most important recovery tool by a country mile,” he says, above and beyond cold plunges, red light therapy, Theraguns and all the other trendy gadgets and hacks. Feeling sore? Sometimes, a good night’s rest is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I become more active in daily life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting the gym or the running track a few times a week is great, and will have huge benefits for your well-being and chances of living a long life. But moving more isn’t just about doing so in siloed time slots. You’ll also want to move more throughout the day. Koch has some recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit time being sedentary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Consider using a standing desk or exercise ball to replace your chair and regular ‘movement snacks’ to reduce the long hours sitting at a desk everyday,” Koch suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:16:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBpa0JqQi1PRzcxdmQ2N2xtYnJzSmowNi0wMnFBcGRFMk93Y3JPb2F1bmVRNVFzSVNLek9SZDVJVnFhZHRUZUk3RlIxLVp3Sm5CR1RxT3I2ZHV4ODNvUzF3</guid></item><item><title>117岁女性的DNA研究揭示了长寿的线索- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/dna-study-of-117-year-old-woman-reveals-clues-to-a-long-life</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There's no escaping the unrelenting passage of time, but supercentenarians who live to see their 110th birthday have a peculiar ability to postpone the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thorough health evaluation of one of the world's oldest people, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-on-worlds-oldest-woman-confirms-how-to-live-past-100"&gt;Maria Branyas&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that one of the reasons she lived to 117 was that she possessed an exceptionally young genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of her rare genetic variants are linked to longevity, immune function, and a healthy heart and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-to-100-these-four-habits-might-help-get-you-there"&gt;Want to Live to 100? These Four Habits Might Help Get You There.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Spain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102368"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they are now using these findings to "provide a fresh look at human aging biology, suggesting biomarkers for healthy aging, and potential strategies to increase life expectancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are based on blood, saliva, urine, and stool samples that Branyas volunteered before her passing in 2024, when she was the oldest living person in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102368"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; a team led by scientists at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, Branyas had cells that "felt" or "behaved" as though they were much younger than her chronological age.

She also displayed extremely low levels of 'bad' cholesterol and triglycerides, and very high levels of 'good' cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these factors may help explain her excellent health and extreme longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas lived a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-on-worlds-oldest-woman-confirms-how-to-live-past-100"&gt;mentally, socially, and physically active life&lt;/a&gt;, but she also lucked out on genetics. While eating a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mediterranean-diet-linked-to-23-lower-risk-of-death-in-women"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; high in yogurt may have played a role in her lengthy life, extreme longevity is probably influenced by a wide range of genetic and environmental variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, scientists noticed a "huge erosion" in Branyas' &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-you-live-in-a-blue-zone-heres-why-you-might-live-longer-for-it"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt; – the caps at the ends of her chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres protect our genetic material, and shorter ones are linked to a higher risk of death. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2018.09.002"&gt;Recent studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, suggest that among the oldest of the old, telomeres are not actually a useful biomarker of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, having very &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depressive-symptoms-and-memory-loss-in-older-adults-linked-to-telomere-shortening"&gt;short telomeres&lt;/a&gt; may have provided Branyas with an advantage. Hypothetically speaking, write the authors, the short lifespan of her body's cells may have stopped  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="175263" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; from ever proliferating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The picture that emerges from our study, although derived only from this one exceptional individual, shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.10236"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers, led by epigeneticists Eloy Santos-Pujol and Aleix Noguera-Castells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175275" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology-642x641.png" alt="Branyas Physiology" class="size-medium wp-image-175275" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology-642x641.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology-416x415.png 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology-768x767.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology-1536x1534.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology-600x599.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BranyasPhysiology.png 1658w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175275" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Younger features and aging features of Maria Branyas.

Santos-Pujol, Noguera-Castells, and their colleagues in Spain acknowledge that larger cohorts are needed to extrapolate on their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-suggests-key-differences"&gt;larger studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing exceptionally long-lived people to their shorter-lived peers have also found biomarkers that set some humans apart, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;unique features&lt;/a&gt; that may help them resist disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centenarians are the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-suggests-key-differences"&gt;fastest-growing demographic&lt;/a&gt; in the world, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-on-worlds-oldest-woman-confirms-how-to-live-past-100"&gt;only 1 in 10 people&lt;/a&gt; who make it to 100 live to see the next decade. What Branyas has provided researchers is a rare opportunity to study the possible pathways that make an extreme human lifespan possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Born in San Francisco in 1907, Branyas moved to Catalonia in 1915 and survived two world wars, the Spanish civil war and the Covid pandemic, recovering from the virus aged 113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72cdd26f-fbd6-4d18-8c05-273b846f9a79" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why do the children of elderly patients stay away?

The tests delved into her genetics and the extent to which different genes were switched on and off; the varieties and levels of proteins in her blood, the breakdown products from reactions in her body and the diversity of microbes in her gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Among a trove of discoveries, they found that protective caps called telomeres on the ends of Branyas’s chromosomes were exceptionally short, a clear sign of old age in her cells. Her immune system also showed signs of old age, was prone to inflammation, and she had acquired mutations that lead to leukaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Branyas was seemingly well protected. Telomeres shorten whenever cells divide, and hers were so short they may have protected her from cancer by limiting the amount that cells continued to divide, Esteller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A close look at her DNA revealed gene variants that protected her heart and brain cells from disease and dementia. She had low levels of inflammation throughout her body, which reduced her risk of cancer and diabetes, and efficient cholesterol and fat metabolism. “These are all critical because they’re linked to diseases that are typical in older people and they kill you at the end,” Esteller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Headlines Europe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;newsletterId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;headlines-europe&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her gut microbiome was also very young for her age with plenty of Bifidobacterium, which is also considered beneficial to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her long life was not all down to genetics, however. Branyas was not overweight, ate a lot of yoghurt, and did not smoke or drink. She had a good social life with friends and family nearby. All surely helped, Esteller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He hopes the wealth of information will help scientists develop new treatments to keep people healthy in old age. “We can develop drugs to reproduce the effects of good genes,” he said. “Maria’s parents gave her very good genes, but we cannot choose our parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof João Pedro de Magalhães at the University of Birmingham, said: “These outliers in longevity could provide insights into how to age more gracefully. If we could figure out which specific genes are associated with extreme human longevity and healthy old age it could provide clues about mechanisms for ageing as well as drugable targets to develop interventions that allow everyone to live longer, healthier lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOQVlLWUNNTTN1MzEyel9VQlRFVTBRVXlFNlhJMXZ4aDdfSm5KQ29VQXpyTFBYd3B4enBYLVZVVTd1TG9EMU1wVTU4Y1FhNkxEdHMwUXF0NlNiOEN6dElFaUswdE9NVnJhb3NhcXpOQXJ1R3UzMzdOYzlUR3RfZVlCY3ZhNFktNDl6T2hBSnFORTlueVVhdml6UE5CYWxKOGY2N1VfU0doVFkxWVZyanprT25iTUVBc2x1eDRj</guid></item><item><title>独家： RFK Jr取消了mRNA研究—但美国军方仍在为其提供资金- Nature</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03093-6</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_51471182.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_51471182.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A U.S. military medic administers a Covid-19 vaccine to a soldier." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_51471182.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;The US government invests in vaccine development to, in part, protect soldiers from dangerous pathogens in various parts of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Jon Cherry/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;abrupt termination last month&lt;/a&gt; of nearly half a billion dollars in US government contracts for mRNA-vaccine research rattled scientists working inside and outside industry.

Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; — pulls back, the country’s military continues to bankroll parts of the same research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the beneficiaries are programmes developing vaccines against some of the world’s deadliest pathogens, including the virus that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne disease that kills up to 40% of those infected. In the United States, the government considers such research crucial not only because these pathogens threaten soldiers deployed abroad, but also because they could ignite a global outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of us are at least relieved the Department of Defense [DoD] is not abandoning mRNA research,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he cautions that the HHS’s rejection of the technology, combined with broader policy fractures across the government, threatens to hobble national — and global — readiness for emerging infectious threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole biodefence structure is completely derailed,” Adalja says. “I’ve never seen it be disconnected like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turbulent times&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Berglund learnt that his company’s federally backed vaccine programme was being cut the same way that many other affected firms did — &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;in a 5 August notice&lt;/a&gt; from the HHS’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which ordered an immediate shutdown of ongoing studies. For Berglund, chief scientific officer at HDT Bio in Seattle, Washington, the news was a gut punch, as he told colleagues at a conference on RNA-based therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts, this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_50788742.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;NIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDT had been developing a next-generation CCHF vaccine based on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03859-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03859-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;a form of RNA that can copy itself inside cells&lt;/a&gt;. The company had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, which it used first to test a shot in mice&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and monkeys&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and then to begin a human trial in Texas this July. The BARDA memo brought everything to a halt the very next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “that was mommy”, Berglund says. “Then daddy calls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days, HDT executives heard from project managers at the DoD’s Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, which had been co-funding the CCHF vaccine research. HDT was told to restart its trial, with the JPEO pledging support through at least this first phase of clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been so turbulent,” Berglund says. The DoD funding, although substantial, is less than what had originally been pledged in conjunction with BARDA. “But, at least now, we can advance it through phase I” and worry about the rest later, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A ‘restructuring’ of resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others with projects co-funded by the JPEO also learnt of funding cuts and a “restructuring of collaborations” in the 5 August notice. But their situation is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, UK, began a human trial of two mRNA vaccines, despite the notice.

The JPEO did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard disputed suggestions that withdrawing from joint projects would weaken the nation’s pandemic preparedness, writing that “BARDA is prioritizing evidence-based, ethically grounded solutions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_51471180.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_51471180.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A coloured scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the Marburg virus." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03093-6/d41586-025-03093-6_51471180.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Like its relative Ebola, Marburg virus can also cause haemorrhagic fever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: NIAID/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Dominique Debroux, James Keppel and Jenny Watson don’t know each other, but all reached a point in their lives where they needed to make drastic changes to turn around potentially life-threatening conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they wanted — badly — to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you wake up and your first thought is, ‘I’m so sick. Oh my god, I am so sick!’ your brain is going to keep reminding you how sick you are. Instead, wake up and say to yourself, ‘Yeah, I’m going through some heavy stuff. What I want to do is find the solution,’” said Debroux, a 60-year-old survivor of cervical cancer and Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the era of the so-called wellness revolution, the pressure to achieve a perfect lifestyle can be daunting. So exactly how do we kickstart a wellness journey without getting overwhelmed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have done it, along with trainers and educators, have some advice:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Define ‘wellness’ and start small&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristina Schuldt is a family medicine physician and wellness director for about 14,000 employees of the Mayo Clinic Health System. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wellness means different things to people. There’s fitness and physical wellness, but there’s also mental wellness, financial wellness, spiritual wellness,” she said. “A person should define what their wellness goal is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t take on the entire wellness universe at once, she warned. Start with small steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well." data-align-center&gt;
    
    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase water intake, for example, using a bottle or jug big enough to hold a day’s worth, with markings on the side to let you see how much you drink. If quitting smoking is the goal, cut down by one cigarette until it feels comfortable, then do the same thing again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;That goes for getting your steps in, too. If you’re not used to long walks, start with a few blocks and increase by two every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the kitchen, sample superfoods to find out which ones work best for daily life. Will it be pumpkin but not kale? Flaxseed but not cranberries? Don’t force yourself to eat foods you don’t like. At the table, eat slowly. Savor each bit and try to recognize when you’re nearly full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Go with what we call the low-hanging fruit at first,” Schuldt said of first steps overall. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Think broadly on healing care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debroux, a filmmaker in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, was 20 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. While seeking some traditional treatment, including minimal surgery and radiation, she also turned to a holistic doctor for guidance on diet, supplements, and things like meditation and biofeedback therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all worked, but years later, at age 47, she faced another health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My body wasn’t working anymore. I was exhausted all the time. I had all-over body aches, constant headaches. I was having neurological issues to the extent that at one point, I couldn’t remember one of my brother’s names,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debroux’s gynecologist brushed it off as perimenopause, but that diagnosis didn’t feel right. She again sought out a holistic practitioner, who discovered Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went into that same space of, OK, let’s do everything. Healing means the whole body,” said Debroux, now 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She combined mainstream medication with herbs and paid close attention to nutrition. Four years later, the Lyme infection was undetectable. She went on to start a company that sells a protein powder made of peas.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Find what works and stick with it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her heaviest, Jenny Watson weighed 420 pounds. In January 2023, she said, “I was at a point where I was like, I can’t do this anymore. I’m tired. My body hurts. I had hit rock bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson, a 36-year-old mom of two and a hairstylist in suburban Dallas, had tried fitness programs, but nothing ever stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What finally worked for me was picking up the right tools,” Watson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That included infrared sauna, in her case at HotWorx, which has outlets across the country. Various fitness sessions, from yoga to high-intensity interval training, are guided by trainers via screens set up in heated, infrared sauna rooms that accommodate up to three people, avoiding the pressure of huge class sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson cites the kindness and encouragement of the staff for helping to get her over the hump. While she’s still not at her ideal weight, the pounds she lost have stayed off.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;She continues to train, including weightlifting, while making other changes. She used to be a night owl, but she and her husband vowed to head to bed at 10 p.m. She started eating more whole foods, cutting many chemicals and processed foods from her diet. Her husband is her biggest supporter, making changes in solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Put a pin in the ‘eat, pray, love’ fantasy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea Leigh Rogers, a fitness trainer who has worked with Gisele Bündchen, Nicole Scherzinger and other celebrities, is out with a new book come October: “Small Moves, Big Life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her key points: Don’t fall for whatever wellness trend is making the rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s the game of comparison. I don’t look like her. I can’t do that if I don’t look like her. Other barriers also feel heavy, like I have to pay $50 to do one class,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t. What you DO need is to be consistent. That might mean mindful breathing, followed by a few minutes of stretching and a 10-minute workout in the morning. Or it could be a new approach to breakfast, or a rethink on the crush of daily responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all have 10 minutes,” Rogers said. A good plan, she added, follows the acronym FEEL: “It’s fast, it’s enjoyable, it’s effective and there’s longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sometimes, a reboot is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Keppel, in Fort Collins, Colorado, nearly lost his liver to cirrhosis. That was in 2019. His first order of business was to get sober, which he did through rehab. He healed by making a series of nutritional and other life changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a series of devastating developments, including a split with his wife and the premature loss of a close family member, left him floored. He sold his design company and turned to his sister for help, moving in with her and her family in Pennsylvania for nearly a year. He had to turn off the go-go rhythm of his old life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I slept a whole lot. I watched a lot of TV. I read a lot of books. I stayed off my computer. I didn’t take many phone calls,” he said. “I just slowly kind of ramped back up. You have to give yourself the space to get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keppel was inspired by his success to start his own private health care company offering one-on-one care.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

The lower-cost version will be rolled out in 2027 across 120 low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Scientists say the drug stops the virus from replicating inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The agreement announced on Wednesday was reached between the Clinton Health Access Initiative in partnership with the Gates Foundation and other groups, including South African research institute, Wits RHI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"For many low- and middle-income countries, affordable access to HIV prevention is not a luxury, it is a necessity," Professor Saiqa Mullick from Wits RHI told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She added that Lenacapavir had "the potential to transform prevention, especially for young people and underserved communities who struggle with frequent clinic visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The real work begins now, partnering with communities and governments to build demand, secure commitments, and prepare systems so countries are ready for rapid introduction and scale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Lenacapavir has delivered impressive trial results and, in July, it received official backing from the World Health Organization for HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The injection is taken twice a year and provides six months of protection against HIV infection at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Experts say long-acting injectables like Lenacapavir could help reduce new infections in populations that are most vulnerable, including adolescent girls and young women, LGBT people, sex workers, and those who use drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It is hoped it will replace the current form of HIV preventative drug, know as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is taken orally and also costs $40 per person each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The pills are taken daily, which can be difficult for patients to consume, and can carry stigma in certain societies. The daily dose also makes it harder to access consistently. According to the Gates Foundation, only 18% of those who could benefit from PrEP currently have access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Lenacapavir has already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Last year June, the US drug company Gilead announced that a trial of its HIV drug Lenacapavir had a 100% success rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The new, generic version is still pending regulatory approval but it is hoped it will be available within 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;One study says that increasing access to the injection to just 4% of the population could prevent up to 20% of new HIV infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The drug can be used to protect people from catching the virus, but also to treat those who have it, according to scientists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The announcement comes amid a turbulent year for global health, particularly the fight against HIV and Aids, following swingeing cuts by the US government's foreign aid programme, USAID, under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;According to UNAIDS, more than 40 million people are currently living with HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Despite huge strides made to reduce global HIV rates and AIDS-related deaths since 2000, about 1.3 million people still contracted HIV last year, and more than 600,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;South Africa remains the country with the highest number of HIV cases, with almost eight million people living with the virus. It will be one of the countries to access the new, cheaper drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;South Africa's department of health told the BBC that it "supports any efforts to make life saving treatment like Lenacapavir available and accessible at affordable rate to all countries, including low and middle income countries, as and when they need it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="additional-reporting-by-akisa-wandera-in-nairobi" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Additional reporting by Akisa Wandera in Nairobi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:23:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1kbmllbURvMWxYT0lybjRPZFZFUmRRbUI2NktaUDR2b0pqR2ZXbVc2aGJBUXdRZDkyaEZkajVsRE96ZnhjVlVTTkpEbm1TTEVsdmpiUTNfX3laUdIBX0FVX3lxTE9JSW9XcURIYTlqX0lpcDJxUjhsTk1EVTdpV3FFclpId2ZleW5OZTdWWnJaQ1pxTzJSaUFyMkpnZHdOeGRGUXRVQ1Q1d0tkblV2MWJfaWh4bFZha3lDYVpn</guid></item><item><title>专栏|我19岁的孙女抑郁。她的父母能做什么？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2025/09/24/meghan-leahy-granddaughter-depressed-school-job/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SJSE4RV2RRGGHB4OVDABSAHMVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear Meghan: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;My 19-year-old granddaughter has had problems with depression.

Kennedy Jr. broke with long-standing U.S. precedent on Covid shots and childhood immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank"&gt;changes by the group&lt;/a&gt;, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could complicate access in some states and add to public confusion around U.S. vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, several health experts say Americans can take steps to try to secure the vaccines they or their children want or need. For some patients in certain states, access and coverage may not change much at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a meeting in Atlanta last week, ACIP weakened Covid shot recommendations; voted against a combination jab against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox, or MMRV, for children under the age of 4; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt;indefinitely postponed&lt;/a&gt; a vote on whether to change its advisory around the hepatitis B vaccine administered at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose director the Trump administration ousted in August, still needs to sign off on the recommendations. The agency typically adopts the guidance of ACIP, which issues recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108202925" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Chair Dr. Martin Kulldorff speaks with committee members and presenters before the start of an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., Sept. 19, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Alyssa Pointer | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't physically take the vaccines away, but they made it more confusing, they made it more bureaucratic, and by doing that, it disincentivizes people from getting vaccinated," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "It makes it harder for some people to get vaccinated. It creates more friction." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/announce-northeast-public-health-collaborative.page" target="_blank"&gt;regional health alliances&lt;/a&gt; spanning several states are issuing broader vaccine recommendations than the federal government, and many states have signed directives that aim to preserve Covid shot access. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;several major insurance plans have pledged&lt;/a&gt; to continue covering vaccines based on the panel's previous guidance issued by former members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients uncertain about the changes, experts recommend turning to trusted health-care providers or vetted medical groups that have &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;issued their own vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the ACIP members emphasized concerns about vaccine side effects, raising doubts about shots long-proven safe and effective. That's no surprise: Kennedy purged the committee in June and named 12 new members, many of whom have long criticized vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chaotic two-day meeting followed previous steps by Kennedy to limit access to vaccines, including the CDC's decision to drop Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women, and the Food and Drug Administration's limits on who can get new Covid jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're concerned about access to shots against Covid, MMRV and hepatitis B, here's the latest on those vaccines and what you can do to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Should I get a Covid vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer should be yes if you're at high risk of severe illness from Covid, according to health experts and major medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some experts said those at low risk should at least consider getting a Covid shot, or can make their decision based on consultation with a provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP advised that people 6 months and up receive vaccines based on "shared clinical decision-making," a choice made between a health-care provider and a patient or their guardian. The group also voted to emphasize that for those under 65, the Covid vaccine is most beneficial for people at high risk of severe illness from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the panel is recommending that everyone consult &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.htmlhtml" target="_blank"&gt;a health-care provider&lt;/a&gt; when deciding whether to receive a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health experts said the panel should have recommended that all people at high risk of severe illness from Covid get the shot. That includes adults ages 65 and above; those under that age with at least one condition that puts them at high risk, such as cancer, obesity or chronic kidney disease; pregnant women; and children under the age of 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is paramount for those groups, as it helps prevent severe Covid and the risk of hospitalization or death due to the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their recommendation is treating Covid as if it's the same for everybody irrespective of risk, and that's the wrong way to think about it," said Johns Hopkins' Adalja. "Any high-risk group should always stay up to date with the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That view largely aligns with guidance from professional medical organizations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836" target="_blank"&gt;recommends &lt;/a&gt;that all children ages 6 months through 23 months get an updated shot, along with older children ages 2 years through 18 years in certain risk groups or who are in close contact with people at high risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;recommends &lt;/a&gt;that patients receive an updated Covid vaccine at any point during pregnancy, when planning to become pregnant, in the postpartum period or when lactating. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends &lt;/a&gt;that all adults 19 years and older receive an updated shot, with a particular emphasis on those at high risk or people who have never received a Covid vaccine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two regional health alliances comprised of several states – The Northeast Public Health Collaborative and the West Coast Health Alliance – have &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;based their Covid vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; on the guidance from those three organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adalja said it is reasonable for a person at low risk of severe illness to rely on a conversation with a provider when determining whether to get a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Richard Dang, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California, said he recommends everyone consider getting a Covid shot regardless of their risk level. Dang is also &lt;a href="https://mann.usc.edu/faculty/richard-h-dang/" target="_blank"&gt;a liaison member&lt;/a&gt; representing the American Pharmacists Association in the Covid vaccine work group of ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from reducing the severity of illness from the virus, some data shows vaccines can help prevent some symptoms of long Covid and other complications that people develop after an infection, according to Dang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy individuals should also think about family and others around them who may be at higher risk of severe illness, said Dr. Pamela Rockwell, a clinical professor of family medicine at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinating yourself may potentially save another life by not potentially infecting them with a vaccine-preventable disease," Rockwell said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several medical experts have emphasized the importance of vaccines as the U.S. heads into the fall and winter, when infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viruses like Covid, spread more easily. While hospitalizations and deaths from Covid have decreased significantly from previous years, the virus is still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How is Covid shot access changing? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to Covid vaccines will largely hinge on the state a patient lives in, so health experts recommend Americans check with their providers, local health departments or nearby pharmacies about how they can get a shot and whether they need to meet any new requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adalja said the easiest way to access a shot may be to go to a doctor's office. But the vast majority of Americans get their vaccines from pharmacies. Pharmacy rules vary by state, and not all states currently allow pharmacists to give shots outside of the CDC recommended population without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access will likely be unchanged in states within the two regional health alliances. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative is made up of New Jersey, New York state, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Vermont and New York City. Meanwhile, the West Coast Health Alliance has California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many of those states, governors had previously issued executive orders to preserve Covid vaccine access – though directives have varied. For example, in California, &lt;a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260ab144" target="_blank"&gt;a new law&lt;/a&gt; allows pharmacists to independently prescribe and administer the shot as long as the state health department recommends it. The law also requires insurance plans to cover the vaccines the state endorses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as of Sept. 23, pharmacists in Florida are not allowed to provide vaccinations without a prescription from a health-care provider like a physician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some states where the pharmacist may be skittish to give out the Covid vaccine, and that may impact access for some people," University of Michigan's Rockwell said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108202925" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Chair Dr. Martin Kulldorff speaks with committee members and presenters before the start of an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., Sept. 19, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Alyssa Pointer | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement Monday, CVS said it currently offers the updated Covid vaccine to patients with an authorized prescription in the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Utah and West Virginia. CVS said it will be able to offer the Covid shot without a prescription in those states after the CDC approves ACIP's new recommendations around the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it already offers Covid vaccines without a prescription requirement in all other states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, Walgreens said it continues to administer the shot without prescriptions in the "vast majority" of states. But the company will offer the updated Covid vaccines at locations to people ages 3 and older, no prescription required, after the CDC adopts the panel's recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, insurance coverage for Covid vaccines should largely remain the same for many children and adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP's recommendation allows for coverage "through all payment mechanisms," according to an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html" target="_blank"&gt;HHS release&lt;/a&gt;. That includes the Vaccines for Children Program, Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, Medicare and plans through the federal health insurance marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major health insurance group last week said its member plans &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/members" target="_blank"&gt;will cover all vaccines&lt;/a&gt; through 2026 based on ACIP recommendations in place as of Sept. 1 — before the changes made by the new slate of members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member plans of the group, America's Health Insurance Plans, collectively provide coverage and services to more than 200 million Americans. That includes more than a dozen Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, Centene, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS/"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;' Aetna, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ELV/"&gt;Elevance Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HUM/"&gt;Humana&lt;/a&gt;, Kaiser Permanente, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MOH/"&gt;Molina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CI/"&gt;Cigna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group doesn't cover everyone, so experts recommend that patients contact their plans about the Covid shot. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UNH/"&gt;UnitedHealthcare&lt;/a&gt;, the country's largest private health insurer, is not a member of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can my child take the MMRV vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108108653" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Sherry Andrews, right, holds 13-month-old Jaqi Herrera’s hand after administering the first MMR vaccine dose to Herrera at the City of Lubbock Health Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. Feb. 27, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Annie Rice | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a child under 4, it may be more difficult for them to access the combination MMRV vaccine as their first dose. Children older than 4 shouldn't have an issue getting that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, ACIP voted to no longer recommend the combination MMRV shot for children under age 4. Instead, the committee said young children should receive one vaccine for chickenpox and a different shot known as MMR that inoculates against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC still recommends two doses of measles-containing vaccine for children, starting with the first dose at age 12 months to 15 months, and a second at age 4 years to 6 years. The agency previously recommended that children under 4 take the separate MMR shot and chickenpox vaccine or – if families and physicians have a preference – the MMRV vaccine for their first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP's vote does not affect children older than 4, meaning that they can still take the MMRV shot as their second dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the panel's discussion last week focused on the slightly increased risk of seizures accompanied by fever in young children who have received the first dose of the combined MMRV vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health, said that young children can get those so-called febrile seizures from anything that causes a fever, such as an ear infection or a cold. He called it "disappointing to restrict choices for parents" by recommending against the MMRV shot for younger kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-1"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-container"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"&gt;&lt;h2 class="RelatedContent-header"&gt;More CNBC health coverage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Blumberg also noted that the vote may not make much of a difference for some parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 85% of children currently get the MMR and chickenpox vaccines separately for their first dose, according to data collected by the CDC. About 15% of kids get a single dose of the combination MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It made no sense that they would actually need to take a vote on this because there was nothing new to say about it. The majority of people were getting the shots separately anyway," said Johns Hopkins' Adalja. "But when ACIP can get everybody revved up about a combination vaccine and take some kind of vote like that, it scores points with the anti-vaccine movement – even though it's really irrelevant to the practice of medicine." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a briefing on Monday, President &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the MMR vaccine should be separated into three shots, alleging that "it seems to be that when you mix them, there could be a problem." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMR shot has long been safe and effective, and is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6316a4.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;credited &lt;/a&gt;with saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the U.S. Vaccines that protect against just one of the three diseases are also not available in the U.S. due to widespread adoption of the combined shot. Separating the shot into three could hurt uptake, as it could require children to make multiple trips to the doctor's office rather than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has already &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000" target="_blank"&gt;logged the most measles cases&lt;/a&gt; this year since the disease was declared eliminated in the country more than two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Can my baby take the hepatitis B shot?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP postponed a vote on whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B shot from birth to at least one month for most babies born in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision means that the committee's current recommendation – that all infants receive a hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth – will stay in place until the group meets again at a later date. It's unclear when the panel will convene again to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The postponed vote will only affect the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between six and 18 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying the so-called birth dose would change a safe and highly effective recommendation that was introduced in 1991 and is credited with virtually eliminating the disease in young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they're considering is ignoring history," said UC Davis' Blumberg. He said infants face a high risk of getting chronically infected, which can lead to severe health problems, including liver cancer and failure, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blumberg said eliminating a universal birth dose recommendation will "return us to where we were, having about 1,000 kids every year getting infected with hepatitis B during that period" of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump on Monday advocated delaying hepatitis B vaccines until age 12. He suggested that most cases of the disease are sexually transmitted, but infants are susceptible to getting the disease from their mother during childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They don't understand that the fact that you vaccinate at birth is to protect the child who's coming through the birth canal of a person who could be infected. That's what the hepatitis B dose is about," said Johns Hopkins' Adalja. "The vaccine is safe in that child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said some women test positive after their initial test for the virus during pregnancy or can have a false negative, making the birth dose a crucial tool for protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-relatedContent" id="RegularArticle-RelatedContent-2"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-container"&gt;&lt;div class="RelatedContent-nonCollapsibleContent"&gt;&lt;h2 class="RelatedContent-header"&gt;Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQWRUdUZnZVYzN2ZNZC1wRHBRRXRDTy03ZGd6N2M5Q0hMbTdpMWhwSHpzMlc0Tlk1Y3E0SFBXTDY1X3hKV1FuRk1KTTItSUdKUUlkbFVHX0ZIYjEzbEU2MDJLc1BlVzlFZTY1VHZmQ1VSZWgyNVUxczR0cE5VWFFIZjByM0PSAYoBQVVfeXFMUGN1eVVpdXBmb2c4N2dzZ3BSclJYdEwzbDktMExmZVlRdzRkcnNoVHRPQWQ1cmc1eXBTeWVPUnlpSGJzSGo3SnF6R3NEbnRxZjFZV0lTRWR1cnpKZERtcDd2eEFybk9yU2dTcTFPWmdDR2p5T0owUVhzemhwalVmTWc4cDZSZkVZaDVB</guid></item><item><title>您吃喝的东西会导致脱发-《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/what-you-eat-and-drink-can-contribute-to-your-hair-loss/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPN0RRTlRjR0VpbS10am91VDlZdVQzd295ZHkyV1dKZDBkNERtUldoWW5DTW9nMnpHbmxFZDhiUGQ0R194aFhtaFVkOFAyZHI1QjhMVzNqV3lMd0JDYWVra0UtRWxpaGtvWEdCaFF1N0J4THZoWVRvZk1Db1k5UkFOcm1KNTgxQ1dFNWJHcXowYnFCRWVzang1ZzduUnlOekNjV3FpcHpTak8?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What you eat and drink can contribute to your hair loss&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lFc1liTER4RU94WlJib3dBanF5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 12:29:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPN0RRTlRjR0VpbS10am91VDlZdVQzd295ZHkyV1dKZDBkNERtUldoWW5DTW9nMnpHbmxFZDhiUGQ0R194aFhtaFVkOFAyZHI1QjhMVzNqV3lMd0JDYWVra0UtRWxpaGtvWEdCaFF1N0J4THZoWVRvZk1Db1k5UkFOcm1KNTgxQ1dFNWJHcXowYnFCRWVzang1ZzduUnlOekNjV3FpcHpTak8</guid></item><item><title>当我了解到我们的家人接触过麻疹时，我的儿子只有1天大。接下来会发生什么。-雅虎新闻新西兰</title><link>https://nz.news.yahoo.com/son-1-day-old-learned-121227507.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author's 16-month-old during her hospital stay where she may have been exposed to measles. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Lauren Gumpert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m at the hospital when I get the call.

I didn’t feel entirely comfortable with this decision — especially with my 16-month-old just recovering from an infection and borderline immunocompromised. But it was the best decision available to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And because of parents who opt out of vaccinating their kids, I was put in the position to make it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The recent measles scare in Virginia came from a student at a local elementary school.

We’re constantly weighing pros and cons, risks and benefits. In a world that feels more disconnected than ever — when we can bury our heads into our phones and surround ourselves with an echo chamber of conspiratorial ideas — it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So let’s zoom out for a minute. In 1900, infectious diseases (such as pneumonia, influenza and measles) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402687/measles-outbreak-vaccine-kids-children-history" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:killed about 18% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;killed about 18% of children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Before vaccines and other public health measures, 1 in 5 children did not live to see their first birthday. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health: &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/measles-doctors-advice_l_67f69af1e4b0212bce864ab9?utm_campaign=yahoo-recirc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here's What You Should Do If There's A Measles Case In Your Area;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Here's What You Should Do If There's A Measles Case In Your Area&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compare that reality to today, when &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402687/measles-outbreak-vaccine-kids-children-history" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less than 1%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;less than 1%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of children die before their fifth birthday. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back then, childhood was inherently dangerous.

But it’s only thanks to science that illness and death among children is no longer commonplace. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nowadays, it’s easy to take our health for granted — especially with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/18/rfk-jr-anti-vaxxer-vaccine-skeptic/#:~:text=Kennedy%20likes%20to%20say%20that,of%20how%20they%20describe%20themselves." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F.

I’m reminded of a quote by author and activist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10931895-there-s-no-such-thing-as-other-people-s-children" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Glennon Doyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glennon Doyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; who said, “There’s no such thing as other people’s children.” We have an obligation to protect those who cannot opt to protect themselves. This is why I keep my kids home when they’re sick, why I advocate for stricter gun laws and — yes — why I vaccinate my kids. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because measles is an airborne disease, one infected person can easily pass it on to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/story-measles-five-charts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18 other people;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;18 other people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. To achieve herd immunity, 95% of the population must be fully vaccinated. Unfortunately, vaccination rates among children have continued to decline since the COVID-19 pandemic, with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline#:~:text=During%20the%202024%2D25%20school,prevent%20transmission%20of%20measles%20virus." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:only 92.5% of kindergartners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;only 92.5% of kindergartners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the U.S. reportedly vaccinated against measles last year.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just this week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5135#:~:text=Public%20Health%20Reminds%20Residents%20About,years%20after%20the%20initial%20diagnosis." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a school-aged child in California died;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;a school-aged child in California died&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; due to a delayed measles-related complication known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The child contracted the disease in infancy before they were eligible for vaccination. If infected, my newborn son could suffer the same fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t want my kids — or anyone else’s — to become another preventable casualty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, both of my daughters received their second MMR vaccine ahead of schedule. However, we still aren’t out of the woods, because measles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/#:~:text=If%20you%20think%20you%20might,discuss%20post%2Dexposure%20treatment%20options." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms can appear as late as 21 days after exposure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;symptoms can appear as late as 21 days after exposure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Additionally, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.babycenter.com/health/doctor-visits-and-vaccines/my-child-developed-a-rash-about-a-week-after-receiving-the-m_1471851" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about 5% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;about 5% of children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; who receive their second vaccine develop a measles-like rash and fever, so it can be difficult to determine whether they have the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now I’m left to wonder and stress about every little bump that surfaces on my daughters’ skin. And if one of them does develop symptoms, I’ll have to contact the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2025-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-confirm-measles-case-in-eastern-region/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Virginia Department of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to get them tested, because I can’t bring them to the pediatrician and risk exposing other vulnerable children. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I understand why many parents have grown to distrust medical institutions. I’ve also had my fair share of negative experiences that sometimes make me doubt doctors’ recommendations and interventions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With so much misinformation circulating on social media, knowing whom to trust can be difficult. But I’m asking you to trust me — a fellow parent, personally affected by your choices, who sincerely wants the best for all of our kids. I’m asking you to trust the health care professionals who have treated your sick child instead of the influencers on social media (who are trying to sell you something) or the corrupt politicians like RFK Jr., who seems to change his opinion often &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to suit his political agenda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;to suit his political agenda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the fact that a link between vaccines and autism has been disproven &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-safe-and-effect-no-link-to-autism/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMultiple%20studies%20from%20around%20the,living%20rich%2C%20fulfilling%20lives.%E2%80%9D" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over and over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;over and over&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, RFK Jr. continues to spread lies and misinformation. He promised Americans that he would find a cause for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“autism epidemic”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;“autism epidemic”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; — a pursuit that won him support among many parents. However, with no formal medical or public health training, the secretary of health continues to undermine the scientific process by hiring incompetent individuals and misappropriating resources to maintain his base of support. For example, he recently employed a known &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/health/rfk-jr-autism-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pseudoscientist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;pseudoscientist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to uncover a link between vaccines and autism (which, as previously stated, studies have found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2101?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:does not exist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;does not exist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5542082/cdc-acip-vaccine-hepatitis-b-mmrv" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent threats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent threats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to vaccine access, 34 scientific and medical organizations including the American Association of Immunologists and the American College of Physicians have come together to produce a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/leading-organizations-unite-to-affirm-vaccine-safety-amid-rising-misinformation-and-declining-trust" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reaffirming the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With so many conspiracy theories circulating on the internet, it can be difficult to know who to trust. As a result, many parents fail to recognize the far-reaching implications of their choices. A once-standard public health measure has become politicized and exploited — and our children will suffer because of it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mother Teresa said: “If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The consequences of a decision like not vaccinating your child are not hypothetical. By now, hundreds of families in Virginia Beach like mine have been affected by one family’s choices. None of us live on an island, and our actions continue to ripple outward and affect others in unexpected ways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this life, we have no choice but to rely on each other. As parents, we have the power to end preventable deaths by vaccinating our children. I hope the vaccine skeptics among us will find the strength to do what’s necessary to keep all of our children safe.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be age that is making your hair thin or fall out, but rather what you are eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;New research shows certain foods contribute to hair loss, and others help with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hair+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hair growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcoholic+drinks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcoholic drinks&lt;/a&gt; are associated with a higher risk of hair loss, according to research &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02601060251367206" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nutrition and Health&lt;/i&gt;, which analyzed 17 studies on diet and hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we consume high amounts of sugar, we get an insulin spike that promotes inflammation and can distort the natural hair growth cycles," explains Laura Acosta, a registered dietitian and associate professor of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With alcohol, it's not that it necessarily directly causes hair shedding itself, but it does contribute to nutrient deficiency, nutrient malabsorption, liver stress, poor sleep, and systemic inflammation—all of which can wreak havoc on hair growth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not consuming enough protein can also lead to hair loss. Acosta says a person needs to take in half a gram of protein per pound of body weight each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We tend to be more protein-deficient than we think," said Dr. Jila Senemar, a Miami menopause specialist who says hair shedding, hormones, and diet are all interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foods that can help with healthy hair and hair growth include soy-based nourishment like edamame or tofu, and cruciferous veggies like broccoli or cauliflower, which can reduce the risk of hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Nutritionists believe this is likely due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of their phytochemicals, such as isoflavones and carotenoids. Additionally, persimmon leaf has been studied and found to be linked to improvements in both hair density and thickness. Persimmon leaf contains antioxidants like quercetin that improve blood flow to the scalp. You can drink it in tea or take an oral supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most studies in this new review primarily included women, one study involving 76 men with male pattern baldness found greater hair growth in a group that consumed 400 mg of pumpkin seed oil for 24 weeks compared to a placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the reason for the hair growth may be hormonal—pumpkin seed oil may decrease dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone known to affect hair follicles and cause hair thinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to supplements, Vitamin D has been the most studied. At least five studies analyzed in this review found that higher vitamin D levels may be protective against hair loss. Acosta said 2,000 international units (IUs) would be a good dose to aim for, noting there is risk for toxicity if someone takes too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another supplement to consider is iron. One study showed that iron supplementation (in the form of 100-milligram tablets) improved hair growth in women. Senemar, the Miami doctor, said if someone is iron-deficient and wants to take supplements, she suggests taking them with vitamin C, which can help increase iron absorption. She points out that certain foods are good sources of iron, including spinach, lentils and almonds.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Acosta recommends having your iron levels tested along with your zinc and biotin (Vitamin B7) levels because deficiencies can cause &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hair+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hair loss&lt;/a&gt; or thinning. Adults need 30 micrograms of biotin daily. It can be found in foods like meats, eggs, fish, seeds, nuts and vegetables like sweet potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're not biotin deficient, though, taking biotin supplements is unlikely to help your hair," Acosta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, research has been focused on collagen for hair growth. "There is some exciting research going on around collagen supplements that a few years ago I probably would have dismissed, but now it really has my attention," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the newly published review, researchers scoured three big scientific databases—PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus—using keywords like "dietary intake," "nutritional status," and "hair growth." In total, the studies involved 613,320 individuals, mostly females, ranging in age from 7 to 77 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These were &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/observational+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that we see associations, but we can't necessarily prove causation from these types of studies," Acosta explained.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug, given as an injection every six months, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/26/lenacapavir-drug-trial-linda-gail-bekker-treating-hiv-aids-africa-women-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost completely prevented new cases&lt;/a&gt; of HIV in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The World Health Organization recommended it as a preventive drug&lt;/a&gt; in July, with the director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, describing it as “the next best thing” to an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There had been questions about whether the drug would be affordable enough to make a difference in the &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/hiv-rates-by-country" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;countries with the highest rates of HIV&lt;/a&gt;. It was launched in the US with a list price of $28,218 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gilead, which brought the drug to market, has now granted voluntary licences to six generic manufacturers, including Dr Reddy’s and Hetero Labs, to supply the product in 120 low- and middle-income countries through national HIV programmes and organisations such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-fund-to-fight-aids-tuberculosis-and-malaria+global-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://unitaid.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Unitaid&lt;/a&gt;, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (Chai) and the Johannesburg-based Wits RHI have entered into partnership with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, while the Gates Foundation has an agreement with Hetero Labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The $40 price tag will put the injectable drug in the same bracket as HIV-prevention pills, which many people at higher risk of infection struggle to take. The stigma surrounding HIV often means they want, or need, to hide the fact they are taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unitaid’s director, Dr Philippe Duneton, said: “Securing a $40 price for the twice-yearly lenacapavir injection for PrEP is a historic breakthrough that proves the most advanced tools can be made affordable from the very start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7f9a03e6-a901-4d49-a129-20867145ac3f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.TimelineAtomBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="TimelineAtom" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"id":"14b38dd5-8a96-4ba6-b95e-bf179f9fb8f3","title":"Eight key dates in the fight against Aids and HIV","events":[{"title":".","date":"1981","body":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first reports of a mysterious, deadly illness affecting gay men in the US appear in scientific journals.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","unixDate":372124800000},{"title":" ","date":"1983","body":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris report the discovery of a virus that could be the cause of Aids – now known as HIV.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","unixDate":416707200000},{"title":"","date":"1987","body":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first antiretroviral (ARV) drug to fight HIV and Aids is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

&lt;p data-start="1486" data-end="1611"&gt;Here are five powerful activities that, if practiced regularly, will help you age better than 95% of the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1618" data-end="1671"&gt;1. Engage in three sessions of moderate exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1673" data-end="1736"&gt;Movement is the closest thing we have to a fountain of youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1738" data-end="1802"&gt;But you don’t need to run marathons or spend hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1804" data-end="1883"&gt;Just three sessions of moderate exercise each week can transform how you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1885" data-end="1986"&gt;This could mean brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing, or strength training with light weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1988" data-end="2080"&gt;The key is to get your heart rate up while keeping the activity sustainable and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2082" data-end="2185"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Strengthen%20your%20bones%20and%20muscles,in%20their%20physical%20activity%20routines."&gt;Regular movement&lt;/a&gt; preserves muscle mass, strengthens bones, and protects your joints as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2187" data-end="2326"&gt;It also sharpens your mind—research shows that physical activity boosts blood flow to the brain, reducing your risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2328" data-end="2413"&gt;Think of these three sessions as non-negotiable appointments with your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2415" data-end="2505"&gt;Each one builds resilience, helping you stay independent and active for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2512" data-end="2579"&gt;2. Schedule one social activity that brings genuine connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2581" data-end="2675"&gt;As people age, one of the biggest predictors of long-term well-being isn’t diet or exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2677" data-end="2698"&gt;It’s relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2700" data-end="2814"&gt;Humans are wired for connection, and loneliness has been shown to be as harmful to health as smoking or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2816" data-end="2907"&gt;That’s why making time for at least one meaningful social activity each week is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2909" data-end="2998"&gt;This could be dinner with friends, a game night, a walking group, or even volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3000" data-end="3070"&gt;The format doesn’t matter as much as the quality of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3072" data-end="3209"&gt;When you spend time with people who make you laugh, listen to you, and truly &lt;em data-start="3149" data-end="3154"&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; you, your stress levels drop and your mood improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3211" data-end="3310"&gt;It’s a simple but powerful way to protect your mental health and emotional resilience as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3312" data-end="3362"&gt;Plus, social connections provide accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3364" data-end="3444"&gt;When you commit to showing up for others, you’re also showing up for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3451" data-end="3512"&gt;3. Dedicate two hours to a mentally challenging activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3514" data-end="3568"&gt;Your brain needs exercise just as much as your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3570" data-end="3671"&gt;As you age, cognitive decline isn’t inevitable—but keeping your mind sharp requires regular effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3673" data-end="3751"&gt;Each week, set aside at least two hours for a mentally stimulating activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3753" data-end="3836"&gt;This could be broken up into shorter sessions, like 30 minutes four times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3838" data-end="3942"&gt;The activity itself should challenge you, pushing you to think, problem-solve, or learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3944" data-end="4073"&gt;Examples include reading complex material, doing puzzles, learning a language, playing a musical instrument, or taking a class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4075" data-end="4129"&gt;The goal is to keep building new neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4131" data-end="4254"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-is-cognitive-reserve"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4155" data-end="4174"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—essentially a buffer that helps your brain stay strong even as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4256" data-end="4353"&gt;Over time, these two hours per week act like armor against memory loss and mental sluggishness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4355" data-end="4422"&gt;And the bonus? You’ll likely discover new passions along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4429" data-end="4491"&gt;4. Spend time outdoors for physical and emotional balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4493" data-end="4545"&gt;Modern life keeps many of us indoors far too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4547" data-end="4635"&gt;Screens, artificial light, and constant stimulation take a toll on both body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4637" data-end="4708"&gt;Spending time outside each week is a simple yet transformative habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4710" data-end="4821"&gt;Sunlight helps regulate your sleep cycle and boosts vitamin D levels, which support bone health and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4823" data-end="4974"&gt;Fresh air and natural scenery reduce stress and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8125471/"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, while gentle outdoor movement—like walking or gardening—keeps your body limber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4976" data-end="5040"&gt;Aim for at least a couple of hours spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5042" data-end="5154"&gt;This could be a morning walk, an afternoon hike, or simply sitting on your porch and soaking in the fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5156" data-end="5221"&gt;Nature has a grounding effect that’s hard to replicate indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5223" data-end="5329"&gt;Even brief, regular exposure helps you feel calmer, clearer, and more connected to the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5336" data-end="5384"&gt;5. Practice intentional rest and reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5386" data-end="5493"&gt;Many people think “rest” just means collapsing on the couch with a show or scrolling through their phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5495" data-end="5526"&gt;But true rest is intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5528" data-end="5616"&gt;It’s about deliberately slowing down and giving your nervous system a chance to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5618" data-end="5718"&gt;Each week, carve out time for reflective rest—activities that are both restorative and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5720" data-end="5822"&gt;This might include meditation, journaling, stretching, or simply sitting quietly with your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5824" data-end="5944"&gt;Some people find this in spiritual practices, while others find it in creative hobbies like painting or playing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5946" data-end="6010"&gt;The goal is to create space for self-awareness and inner calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6012" data-end="6149"&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.reflection.app/blog/benefits-of-journaling"&gt;reflective practices&lt;/a&gt; reduce stress hormones, improve emotional regulation, and even support better immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6151" data-end="6238"&gt;As you age, this kind of inner balance becomes just as important as physical fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6240" data-end="6306"&gt;It’s what keeps you steady when life throws curveballs your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6313" data-end="6336"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6338" data-end="6405"&gt;Most people underestimate the power of small, consistent actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6407" data-end="6480"&gt;They think aging well requires extreme measures or expensive solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6482" data-end="6587"&gt;In reality, it’s the little things—done week after week—that add up to a dramatic difference over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6589" data-end="6606"&gt;Three workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6608" data-end="6644"&gt;One meaningful social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6646" data-end="6678"&gt;Two hours of mental challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6680" data-end="6704"&gt;Regular time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6706" data-end="6753"&gt;A session of intentional rest and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6755" data-end="6833"&gt;These habits form a framework for a longer, healthier, more fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6835" data-end="6913"&gt;And while they may seem simple, very few people commit to them consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6920" data-end="6940"&gt;Closing thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6942" data-end="7025"&gt;Aging well isn’t about avoiding wrinkles or pretending to be twenty-five forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7027" data-end="7101"&gt;It’s about staying vibrant, engaged, and capable in every stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7103" data-end="7233"&gt;By committing to these five weekly activities, you’re not just adding years to your life—you’re adding &lt;em data-start="7206" data-end="7215"&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; to those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7235" data-end="7252"&gt;So start today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7254" data-end="7316"&gt;Protect your future self by showing up for these habits now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7318" data-end="7409"&gt;Because decades from now, you’ll look back and realize that aging well wasn’t about luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7411" data-end="7467"&gt;It was about the choices you made, one week at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

But they probably didn’t expect to spot bats inside their rooms at the Jackson Lake Lodge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what at least eight guests saw between mid-May and late July, though. A bat colony had moved into the historic structure, which houses a hotel and restaurant, potentially exposing hundreds of national and international visitors to rabies, a fatal disease if left untreated. Though all the colony’s bats were tested for rabies (which requires euthanasia) and came back negative, health officials couldn’t say for certain that everyone was safe from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Wyoming Department of Health quickly jumped into action, partnering with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other states’ health departments to track down guests who’d stayed in rooms with known bat encounters. That meant getting in touch with guests from over 230 reservations, who lived in 38 different states and seven countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation found that of the guests staying in the impacted rooms, less than 10 people, or just two groups of reservations, had a high enough risk to warrant getting the post-exposure vaccine series, Wyoming state public health veterinarian Emily Curren told SFGATE. “That was a huge relief,” Curren said. “Most people did it just to be on the safe side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 98% of people surveyed during the outreach investigation never saw a bat and were considered to have no or low risk of rabies exposure, according to Curren. “We were super thrilled that the vast majority of the people were not at risk,” she said. Outreach did turn up two visitors who had seen a bat and hadn’t already reported it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bat teeth are small enough to not cause a visible bite or draw blood, which is why treatment could be warranted even if a wound or scratch isn’t visible. Sleeping people may not know if they came into contact with a bat.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months for rabies to sicken a human, depending on where the person was bitten (which determines how long it takes the virus to reach the brain). The post-exposure vaccine series &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;includes&lt;/a&gt; a dose of human rabies immune globulin and four rabies vaccine doses over two weeks if the patient has never received a rabies vaccine before. The series protects those bitten by a rabid animal as long as the shots are completed before symptoms develop. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 100,000 Americans receive the shots after potential rabies exposures every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wyoming Department of Health, the National Park Service, park concessionaires and the CDC met this summer for a site visit of the lodge and other historic park properties. The buildings are difficult to bat-proof entirely, as the little brown creatures can squeeze through cracks that are a quarter-inch wide. “It’s crazy how small they can squish themselves down,” Curren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand Teton National Park is &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/wildlife-and-rabies.htm" data-link="native" class=""&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; to at least nine different species of bats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:05:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOLUxaSjZBdUxZcVdvT2Q2RWxGOVp5NDh3b2dmdEo4b09lTXc2XzRBcnJVdTZjeGtUQWJJcEM3NmNORHpEWUcxTVduLUhRbEFrZ3A2T0djdmdiRlpadldwYW9XXzNmQklwZEJXOG0tLTdxbmx4RlZZSThQbFBRSkdhS0JvZUhITld5dEU2U2RKeU9mNVhCZktoSUJWNnpRNHpBYWphWDMtdFo</guid></item><item><title>慈善机构达成一项有希望的交易，以扭转艾滋病毒感染的局面-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/health/hiv-treatment-shots-lenacapavir.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOdjVnNmxaRkFBeEtfa1I4UHlLNTBxQk1nNzdLS0U5UnN0V3JWVlJkem9tWFNScG5OQUl3S3ZUeW9zUGFsZ1JScWU1ZDdza3R1THhscGt3QkhBbjRjbG81aDRJbzg5aUtaOXUwcUQtZElUdkdsV2hPNW03Rl9CdDNGX2FHVUc</guid></item><item><title>治疗前列腺癌的选择比以往任何时候都多--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/well/live/prostate-cancer-treatment-explainer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 09:00:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNdHJ1VmF4V214MDF6ZGNwam9KZDBGVU5sSWM5WWtSbEt0UnhvM2xOb1VuaDQtbnNkTG5zc0JaT0hHNjFoT29GcW1zVzk2bURZY3A3c2RaR2U0eXJDcXBkV2FCUjRWLXNWOXZuR0lPcWwzMVBjcDdoeFVOWVpDbmo1TThOckRMOUdaZzN1NmVn</guid></item><item><title>接吻虫病可能在美国全年持续存在。这对路易斯安那州意味着什么？ - NOLA.com</title><link>https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/kissing-bug-disease-in-louisiana/article_9f15562a-e9e9-4e3f-a866-31fb6cbb1d79.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem with Chagas is that it's a chronic disease that takes years to develop, someone could die without knowing they have it," said Dr. Norman Beatty, a clinician at the University of Florida who contributed to the CDC research and report.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite, and its symptoms, can remain dormant in the body from one year to three decades after infection. Chagas disease does not spread from person-to-person nor does it spread from casual contact with infected animals.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of all kissing bugs carry the parasite that causes Chagas disease, T. cruzi, which is passed when the insects defecate. Scratching the bite or rubbing eyes can push the infected fecal material inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;"Most people find out they have Chagas disease when they give blood," said Aaron Ashbrook, an urban and peri-urban entomologist at Louisiana State University's AgCenter.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can be treated with two different medications benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both kill the parasite and are fully effective in curing Chagas if given earlyÂ â€” the acute phase lasts around two monthsÂ â€” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20presents%20in%20two,one%20eye%20(Roma%C3%B1a's%20sign)." target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of the medication diminishes, however, the longer a person has been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases are not actively rising, the CDC said. However, raising Chagas disease to an endemic could "improve surveillance, research and public health responses" in the U.S., according to the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The longer a person is living with this chronic infection, the longer patients are going to receive permanent damage," Beatty said. "Why do words matter? A new endemic status could bring awareness that it exists, and that we need to screen people at risk and offer therapy, prevent development."&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs have been around for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC357047/" target="_blank"&gt;around 9,000 years old&lt;/a&gt;, according to a National Library of Medicine study, but are more common across Latin America and South America. Chagas disease is an endemic in 21 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 8 million people in the world have Chagas diseaseÂ â€” and around 288,000 people in the U.S.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also estimates that of the total Americans with Chagas, only 10,000 were infected inside the country. Most others contracted the disease in Latin America and then traveled or immigrated to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Still, kissing bugs have been found in 32 states, and there have been cases of local transmission in people in eight states: California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health does not actively monitor positive cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Chagas champion, that's what I call myself," Beatty said. "I want to be an advocate for awareness to spread awareness of this disease. I want there to be more awareness, and data, on a national and state level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to look forÂ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of kissing bug in Louisiana: triatoma sanguisuga, triatoma lecticularia and triatoma gerstaeckeri.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs in Louisiana have a longer lead time for infection, Ashbrook said. A kissing bug in the state would need to be on the body for 30 minutes to defecate and infect the person.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for wildlife and other animals, even dogs, to be infected with Chagas disease from kissing bugs. These infected animals, however, cannot transfer the disease to humans.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can only get it if bitten by an infected kissing bug," Ashbrook said.Â &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs with Chagas disease are common in uninhabited buildings, like hunting cabins or cabins, as well asÂ wildlife rodent burrows, raccoon nests, armadillo burrows and structures for outdoor pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LSU's AgCenter has received many kissing bug inquiries in the last few weeks, according to Ashbrook, on how to handle the pesky creatures.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashbrook advises people who suspect they found a kissing bug to capture it in a bag, freeze it and give it to the LSU AgCenter.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want people to crush the bug," Ashbrook said. "That increases the risk of exposure. Freezing for a few days is better, and kills the bug without much mess."Â &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It's important, however, that people properly identify the bugs as they are very similar to assassin bugs, a beneficial insect in Louisiana.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kissing bugs tend to have pointier heads, Ashbrook said, while the assassin bugs are rounder at the top.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs are black or dark brown and have red, orange or yellow stripes on the edge of their bodies. They are just a little bigger than the size of a penny, can bite without being detected and are most active at night, according to Texas A&amp;amp;M University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans may rely on calculators and spreadsheets, but dogs seem to have a system of their own when it comes to numbers and time. For them, minutes stretch into hours, toys double or disappear without reason, and mealtime is the ultimate measurement of the day. One &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog"&gt;German Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;, Benson, has become the face of this canine arithmetic after his owner shared a video introducing the internet to “dog math.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-german-shepherd-explains-what-dog-math-is-with-examples-in-video"&gt;German Shepherd explains what ‘dog math’ is with examples in video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video, which has already reached more than 3.5 million viewers and racked up 185K likes, uses a robotic voiceover to break down Benson’s unique calculations. It begins by joking, “We’ve had boy math and girl math — now we have dog math.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first rule of Benson’s math is all about his toys. When he has 15 balls to play with, but one rolls under the couch, his logic tells him he suddenly has zero balls. The clip shows him completely fixated on the one missing toy while ignoring the others in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time, according to Benson, is equally skewed. If his owner leaves for three hours, Benson counts it as three hours. But if the absence is only three minutes, he still believes it equals three hours. His dinner schedule follows a similar formula. Dinner is at 5 p.m., no exceptions. If food is served at 5:03, Benson interprets the delay as two full hours. Even if his owner offers dinner early at 4, Benson’s math still counts it as late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Benson also applies his math to affection. After receiving an hour of pets, Benson concludes that when the petting stops, he has actually received zero pets, which must mean his owner doesn’t love him anymore. Toys also come under his system — two identical ones don’t count as two in Benson’s book, just one. Finally, when a dog passes by outside the house, Benson dramatically equates it to “40 dragons” threatening his home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fans quickly jumped in with their own interpretations of Benson’s formulas. One joked, “I wonder how he calculates the treats,” hinting that snack math might be a subject all on its own. Another brushed it off with, “Sounds about right to me,” as though Benson’s numbers were beyond question. Meanwhile, a cat owner chimed in, “Dog math is nothing compared to multiple cats math.” Rounding it off, another fan awarded the pup top honors with a “dogchelors degree in maths.” Indeed, Benson is “very good at math,” as his owner notes in the video’s caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an &lt;a href="/topic/emory-university"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iucbZA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/14/17082821-f11d32eb-38fd-4122-8cd8-77886d1f9cb2.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/14/17082821-f11d32eb-38fd-4122-8cd8-77886d1f9cb2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/19/14/17082821-f11d32eb-38fd-4122-8cd8-77886d1f9cb2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The rate of NDM cases rose by 460 per cent, researchers said" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-123568"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The rate of NDM cases rose by 460 per cent, researchers said&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ nightmare bacteria ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69 per cent. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460 per cent, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, &lt;a href="/topic/new-york"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC report published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 08:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPc2ZHVzlTcVN0MHBQZGUwWFBGSHJTQVNUTzA5WFJnRmZZbGdoWm42eTZfc1pSZTBGRmJMV1VGckY3SXhqN254T0k3NDBhai1HeklCMnZHM2dPNnNScWlWREh5emxBS2pxaGVoek1tMTVFdEM2RXVKeTdDYzU4S2pRT3VBWHBrTnhja210a0dkRVFuYzg1S0RORHVVQ3JMdw</guid></item><item><title>癌症悄然杀死年轻人：一分钟不见了- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5551322/the-cancer-quietly-killing-young-people</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;If more and more young people are dying of colorectal cancer, why aren't we talking about it? Is it because we're too ashamed of our bodies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer are rising, especially for people under 50. But it's hard to raise awareness for a cancer that a lot of us find hard to talk about. In a &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/colorectal-colon-cancer-diagnosis-laurie-abraham.html" target="_blank"&gt;recent essay&lt;/a&gt; for The Cut, writer &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Laurie-Abraham/47098549" target="_blank"&gt;Laurie Abraham&lt;/a&gt; described her experience of colon cancer, which included a lot of embarrassment. Talking about your bowel movements is...not fun.

Regularly putting your muscles under stress with resistance—be that lifting weights or working with your bodyweight—keeps you stronger for longer and helps you to avoid some of the health risks that come with getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s according to James Klein, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lifetime.life/locations/va/gainesville.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.lifetime.life/locations/va/gainesville.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Life Time Gainesville&lt;/a&gt;, who told me why strength training is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="d756c368-e00e-4bf9-98f2-7cde243989b0-2"&gt;“Strength training is critical for overall health because it builds muscle mass, strengthens bones and enhances metabolic function, which collectively reduce the risk of chronic diseases like osteoporosis, diabetes and heart disease,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that by increasing our muscle strength and endurance, we can improve our joint stability, posture and balance, all of which lower the likelihood of injuries and falls, particularly as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular resistance exercise, such as the dumbbell workouts described, supports functional independence, promotes longevity and empowers individuals to perform daily activities with ease, making it a cornerstone of a vibrant, healthy lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klein may be using heavy dumbbells to demonstrate the exercises, but you don’t have to! Choose a challenging weight, but one that allows you to complete all the reps with good form. Selecting the right weight is a fine art, so there’s nothing wrong with changing weights between exercises and even between sets. You can also perform the lunge and squat with just your bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will need a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFLYBIRD-Adjustable-Workout-Multi-Purpose-Foldable%2Fdp%2FB07DNYSJ8W%2Fref%3Dsxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-1453745720559184836-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/FLYBIRD-Adjustable-Workout-Multi-Purpose-Foldable/dp/B07DNYSJ8W/ref=sxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFLYBIRD-Adjustable-Workout-Multi-Purpose-Foldable%2Fdp%2FB07DNYSJ8W%2Fref%3Dsxin_17_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;weight bench&lt;/a&gt; for some of the upper-body exercises, and you should find one at your local gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7Y8vccVGbVGUKYPWBPaBhj" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7Y8vccVGbVGUKYPWBPaBhj slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-walking-lunge" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-walking-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

He adds that by holding a dumbbell at chest height you are encouraging an upright posture and deeper squat depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They primarily work the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings and core muscles, while also engaging the upper back for posture support. This movement is ideal for overall health as it improves hip mobility, trains multi-joint activation and helps prevent lower-back issues by reinforcing proper squat mechanics, making it a staple for progressive strength gains,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-dumbbell-shoulder-press" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-dumbbell-shoulder-press"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

			&lt;p&gt;Imbibing even the smallest amounts of booze can raise your risk of dementia, according to the largest combined observational and genetic study to date on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings counter &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.289.11.1405"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; showing that light-to-moderate drinking might protect against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the new study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol"&gt;cutting out drinking&lt;/a&gt; altogether may be the best way to minimize the risk of dementia later in life, with increasing levels of alcohol consumption matching an increasing likelihood of developing dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;of any kind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study findings support a detrimental effect of all types of alcohol consumption on dementia risk, with no evidence supporting the previously suggested protective effect of moderate drinking," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-is-no-safe-level-of-alcohol-consumption-us-surgeon-general-warns"&gt;There Is No Safe Level of Alcohol Consumption, US Surgeon General Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team began by looking at 559,559 adults in the UK and US, aged between 56 and 72 at the start of the study period. The participants filled out questionnaires on their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-a-night-of-drinking-affects-your-food-choices"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt;, and their health was monitored for up to 15 years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the research resulted in a classic U-shaped graph: non-drinkers and heavy drinkers were shown to have the highest risk of dementia. That fits in with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16035"&gt;some earlier research&lt;/a&gt;, and appears to suggest that moderate drinking is associated with the lowest dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175229" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175229" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph.jpg" alt="Genetic disposition to drinking chart" class="wp-image-175229 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph-409x415.jpg 409w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DementiaGraph-600x608.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175229" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A higher genetic predisposition to drinking was linked to a higher risk of dementia. (Topiwala et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ Evid. Based Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers argue that the protective effect of light drinking doesn't actually exist – that non-drinkers are often heavy drinkers who have quit, or who have cut down on booze because of the early effects of cognitive decline. In other words, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/moderate-drinking-is-not-good-for-you-after-all-study-finds"&gt;stats are skewed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find more evidence, the study also looked at genetic records for 2.4 million people, using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; to analyze drinking in relation to dementia. The approach works by using a genetic predisposition to drinking rather than data on actual drinking habits – which in theory cuts out other factors, such as lifestyle or wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this part of the analysis, the U shape disappeared. The higher the predicted alcohol consumption, the higher &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;the dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, with no dip for light drinkers who enjoyed the occasional beer or glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Halving the population prevalence of alcohol use disorder may reduce dementia cases by up to 16 percent, highlighting alcohol reduction as a potential strategy in dementia prevention policies," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some significant caveats to consider, which the researchers openly acknowledge. In the first part of the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-simple-strategy-that-works-to-reduce-alcohol-intake-scientists-say"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt; were self-reported by the participants, not scientifically observed, which can lead to inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the study, Mendelian randomization is a useful tool, but relies on linking genetic data to the likelihood of a trait – in this case, that someone drinks. It's not a direct record of alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, given the extensive scope of the research and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-until-you-pass-out-linked-to-doubled-risk-of-dementia-giant-study-reveals"&gt;multiple previous studies&lt;/a&gt; that it adds to, it's solid evidence that as we drink more, the chances of cognitive decline and dementia in later life go up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/even-light-drinking-could-increase-risk-dementia-risk-large-study-suggests"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh in the UK, who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

From wellness influencers to nutritionists, everyone seems to advocate consuming chia seeds for energy, digestion, and overall health. While chia water has become a popular method of consumption, recent insights suggest that mixing chia seeds with yogurt can provide even greater benefits. This combination leverages the natural synergy between probiotics in yogurt and prebiotic fibers in chia seeds, enhancing nutrient absorption, promoting gut health, regulating appetite, and supporting sustained energy levels. For those seeking smarter ways to integrate chia seeds into their diet, the chia-yogurt pairing is emerging as a scientifically backed, delicious, and functional superfood. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="29005707" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="chia-seeds-and-yogurt" source="Orion"&gt;chia seeds and yogurt&lt;/keyword&gt; work better together&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Karan Rajan, a UK-based NHS surgeon and health content creator, explains that combining chia seeds with yogurt creates a “natural symbiotic cycle” in the body, promoting gut health, metabolic balance, and overall wellness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fibers and mucilage in chia seeds serve as prebiotics, feeding the beneficial bacteria (probiotics) found in yogurt. This combination not only enhances digestion but also amplifies nutrient bioavailability, supports immunity, and helps regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike chia water, which is absorbed and fermented quickly, yogurt provides proteins and healthy fats that balance the fibers in chia seeds, ensuring a more gradual digestion process. The result is longer-lasting fullness, better nutrient absorption, improved gut microbiota, and a digestive system that functions more efficiently, contributing to sustained energy throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Seeds that can help in quick weight loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29005708" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Chia-yogurt-supercombo" source="Orion"&gt;Chia-yogurt supercombo&lt;/keyword&gt;: Supporting digestion, metabolism, and appetite naturally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chia-yogurt supercombo is a powerful, natural blend that supports digestion, boosts metabolism, and helps control appetite. Packed with fiber, protein, probiotics, and omega-3s, this simple yet effective mix promotes gut health, enhances energy levels, and keeps you feeling fuller longer—making it an ideal addition to any healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prebiotics and probiotics: Enhancing gut health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurt is naturally rich in probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria. These bacteria help maintain a healthy gut microbiome, aid digestion, and support immune function. When combined with chia seeds, which contain soluble fibers acting as prebiotics, the two create a “symbiotic effect” in the gut. Dr. Rajan notes, “Probiotics in the yogurt have a ready snack to ferment, which can improve short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, the gold dust for your health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate and propionate, play a crucial role in colon health, inflammation control, and metabolic regulation. By slowing fermentation compared to chia water, chia-yogurt mixes allow for the production of a wider spectrum of SCFAs, enhancing overall digestive wellness and reducing potential bloating or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nutrient absorption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major advantage of combining chia seeds with yogurt is improved nutrient absorption. Chia seeds are rich in fat-soluble nutrients, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid essential for heart and brain health. The fats in yogurt enhance the bioavailability of these nutrients, ensuring the body absorbs them efficiently. Additionally, calcium and vitamin D in yogurt improve the utilization of other compounds in chia seeds. Dr. Rajan emphasizes that this synergy makes the chia-yogurt mix more nutritionally powerful than consuming chia seeds in water alone, allowing you to maximize the health potential of each ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Appetite control and satiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most practical benefits of this superfood combination is its ability to regulate appetite. Fiber, protein, and fat work together to stimulate satiety hormones such as GLP-1, cholecystokinin, and peptide YY (PYY). This hormonal response promotes a feeling of fullness, reduces overeating, and supports weight management. Unlike chia water, which lacks sufficient protein and fat, the chia-yogurt mix provides sustained energy and keeps hunger at bay for longer periods, making it an ideal breakfast, snack, or post-workout option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Slower fermentation for digestive comfort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia water, while hydrating, can sometimes ferment too quickly in the colon, causing gas or bloating in sensitive individuals. In contrast, combining chia seeds with yogurt slows the fermentation process, creating a balanced environment for beneficial gut bacteria. This gradual fermentation produces a diverse range of SCFAs, including butyrate and propionate, which are vital for colon cell health, inflammation regulation, and metabolic function. The slower fermentation process ensures that the gut benefits without discomfort, making the chia-yogurt combo a gut-friendly, easy-to-digest superfood option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical ways to include chia seeds with yogurt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure and mix: Add 1–2 tablespoons of chia seeds to plain or flavored yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soak for best texture: Let the mixture sit for 15–20 minutes to achieve a pudding-like consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhance flavour: Top with fresh fruits, nuts, seeds, or a drizzle of honey to boost taste and nutrient content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maximise nutrient absorption: The soaking process helps chia seeds release their nutrients effectively, making them easier to digest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On-the-go option: Prepare chia-yogurt parfaits in advance for a quick, gut-friendly breakfast or snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Versatile meal idea: Works for breakfast, post-workout meals, or as a healthy dessert alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Chia seeds with yogurt: A superfood for optimal health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chia water offers hydration and light nutrition, pairing chia seeds with yogurt elevates this superseed to a functional powerhouse. From enhanced nutrient absorption and balanced digestion to improved appetite control and gut health, the benefits are scientifically supported and delicious. For anyone seeking a holistic approach to wellness, integrating chia-yogurt combinations into daily routines is a simple yet effective step toward optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/are-your-eyes-causing-headaches-understanding-the-link-causes-and-ways-to-find-relief/articleshow/124038185.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Are your eyes causing headaches?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While ginger tea offers numerous benefits for gut health, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. To truly nurture a healthy digestive system, it’s important to adopt a holistic approach that incorporates various lifestyle practices. Here are some additional strategies to support and maintain optimal gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Balanced Diet&lt;/strong&gt;: Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins to provide fiber that supports a healthy gut microbiome. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is essential for regular bowel movements, feeding beneficial gut bacteria and helping to maintain a healthy balance of microbes in the digestive system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking plenty of water aids digestion and helps maintain the balance of good bacteria in your gut. Water can also help soften stool, making it easier to pass. Staying hydrated also supports the mucosal lining of the intestines, which aids in nutrient absorption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include Probiotics and Prebiotics&lt;/strong&gt;: Foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut and other fermented foods contain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, while garlic, onions and bananas are good sources of prebiotics. Together, they support a diverse and thriving gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: Some stress in life is inevitable, but consistently high stress levels can negatively impact your gut health. Over time, this can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;increase chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that may disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut, increasing gut permeability and altering digestive function. Stress hormones like cortisol can affect gut motility and the integrity of the gut lining. Practices such as mindfulness, meditation and regular physical activity can help reduce stress and support a healthy gut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a healthy gut is crucial not only for digestion and nutrient absorption, but also for overall well-being, impacting a variety of bodily processes. Among the array of teas that support gut health, ginger tea emerges as a standout, renowned for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to alleviate digestive discomfort. This tea has been shown to reduce nausea, calm indigestion, relieve constipation and decrease inflammation. If you are not a tea-drinker, you can also support your microbiome through a variety-filled diet rich in probiotics and prebiotics, adequate hydration and stress management. The best way to nurture a healthy gut is to take a holistic and well-rounded approach.

			&lt;p&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke, and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-has-new-guidelines-for-high-blood-pressure-heres-what-that-means"&gt;US Has New Guidelines For High Blood Pressure. Here's What That Means.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conversation US asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;"systolic" and the "diastolic" pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of "prehypertension," which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mercury" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="72978" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having "elevated blood pressure" if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise, and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient's overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642.jpg" alt="wine poured into a glass" class="wp-image-175247 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_drinking_alcohol_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol is one way to keep blood pressure down. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFFHBns0U/"&gt;NatashaPhoto/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy, and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175248" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175248" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642.jpg" alt="woman exercising" class="wp-image-175248 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BP_exercise_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175248" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Regular exercise each week can help blood pressure drop.

This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263507/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;I was under the mistaken impression that Health Secretary Worm-Brain’s restrictions on covid vaccinations were already in place. However, when I went to a drug store today for my annual flu shot, I asked if covid shots were still available, and, to my surprise, they were! So I got the newest covid shot in addition to a current flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, RFK Jr. plans to limit access to covid vaccinations to people 65 and over; and to those with serious health conditions. I don’t know how soon it will be when the baseless new vaccine restrictions will be implemented; and implementation might vary from state to state; even though the whole idea of limiting vaccine access is coming from the federal level, via Mr. Worm-Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are able to do so, you ought to get a covid vaccination now! If you’ve already had one fairly recently and you’re unsure if you’re due for an update, err on the side of caution and get one! No one has ever overdosed on vaccinations. And thanks to Health Secretary Worm-Brain, we might no longer have the luxury of waiting a while for our next covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;“You have certain groups — the Amish, for example — that have essentially no autism,” &lt;a href="https://people.com/trump-rfk-jr-says-tylenol-causes-autism-11814830" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; President Donald Trump with trademark certainty yesterday. Stood next to his Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he suggested that Amish people have low levels of autism because Amish women don’t take paracetamol (sold as Tylenol in the US) during pregnancy. Famously, they also don’t spend their days glued to screens; they’re too busy churning butter, raising barns and producing dozens of children. But Trump chose to point the finger at painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinicians across the world scrambled to rebut him. In Britain, Health Secretary Wes Streeting replied, “I trust doctors over President Trump.” It’s easy to be smug, but whatever the driver, Trump is right about one thing: autism figures are rocketing. A generation ago, the condition was rare. By 2000, one in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;150 eight-year-olds&lt;/a&gt; in the US had a diagnosis; by 2022, it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html"&gt;one in 31&lt;/a&gt;. The UK is following the same pattern. Diagnoses rose 787% between &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505"&gt;1998 and 2018,&lt;/a&gt; and the BMA now estimates one in 100 British children &lt;a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/what-we-do/population-health/improving-the-health-of-specific-groups/autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has an ASD label.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a narrow category, “autism spectrum disorder” has metastasised into a fashionable identity. The label now stretches from children who will never speak or live independently to tech titans like Elon Musk. Now that the stigma has ebbed away, pushy middle-class parents angle for diagnoses to give their offspring an educational edge, while students at elite universities &lt;a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/march-2025/oxford-on-the-spectrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;self-identify&lt;/a&gt; as autistic for both extra exam time and the warm glow of victimhood. Meanwhile, those with the most profound needs — whose families are exhausted by round-the-clock care — are increasingly drowned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academics have begun to notice. Professor Ginny Russell of Exeter University &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/04/uk-increase-autism-diagnoses-neurodiversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that ever-wider criteria, often based on self-description rather than clinical observation, risk a situation where “maybe everyone is categorised as neurodiverse”. “As awareness and diagnoses increase, those with less severe symptoms come forward with their own stories of how autism affects them,” Russell says. “The diagnostic criteria is widened to take these accounts on board, which loops back again to another increase in diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not simply a medical question but a cultural one: a disorder once marked by silence and incapacity has become a lazy shorthand for genius. Yet diagnostic creep can only explain part of the phenomenon. Something else is happening to children. As evolutionary biologist Heather Heying writes in &lt;i&gt;A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century,&lt;/i&gt; the “uptick in diagnoses on the autism spectrum” may be “related to the number of children who were raised staring into screens.” “Do not let inanimate objects babysit your children,” Heying commands, “Those seemingly alive creatures, which cannot and therefore will not respond to a child’s looks or gestures or questions, send the message to the developing brain that the world is not an emotionally responsive place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, toddlers pacified by&lt;em&gt; Peppa Pig&lt;/em&gt; on repeat learn that the world does not answer back. Reduced eye contact, poor reciprocity, repetitive behaviours: the classic signifiers of autism can also be the hallmarks of children’s behaviour when raised on screens. If we wanted to manufacture a generation displaying autistic-like traits, we could hardly have done better than to outsource parenting to iPads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author and psychotherapist Joe Burgo, who works with teenagers who identify as trans, sees the same detachment. Patients who “spend countless hours online in virtual interactions, playing video games, and social media scrolling,” he tells me, become unmoored. “This leads to a dissociated experience of being in your head rather than down in your body where you might notice your feeling states. This dissociation is what we’re seeing rather than true ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge in diagnoses, then, is likely twofold: ever-expanding criteria and an environment that fosters autistic mimicry. Tackling it will require more than scolding expectant mothers for taking paracetamol. It means resisting the pathologisation of every quirk, and it means putting down our phones — parents as well as children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Trump may have been half-right. For all their butter-churning and barn-raising, the Amish really might be on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="midcontent3" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                                                        &lt;hr&gt;

                            &lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Those studies, however, focused on older people and didn’t differentiate between former drinkers and lifelong nondrinkers, thus potentially skewing the results, study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the new study, published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm2025-113913" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed how certain genes linked to alcohol might impact how liquor consumption affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The genetic analyses results (showed) that even small amounts of alcohol could increase dementia risk,” said lead study author Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is the largest study on the topic, and the combination of observational and genetic analyses was key,” Topiwala said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The genetic analysis, called Mendelian randomization, has less risk of introducing a confounding or “spurious” variable to explain the alcohol-dementia relationship, Topiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mendelian randomization also reduces the chance of reverse causation, such as dementia processes influencing drinking rather than the reverse, and it can also estimate the cumulative impact of alcohol consumption over a person’s entire life, Topiwala said. Observational studies, however, tend to capture a snapshot of mid- to late-life drinking habits, and depend on subject recall, which may not be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This is a fairly complicated study that provides some, but not definitive evidence, that alcohol can harm the brain regardless of how much is consumed,” said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson, who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In my clinic, we tell people with the APOE4 genetic variant, which is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s, that drinking zero alcohol is best based on the available evidence,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, for people with less genetic risk for Alzheimer’s it often depends on “when” and “how” people drink, Isaacson added. For example, he said, two drinks before bed on an empty stomach several nights will have a more harmful effect on brain health compared with one drink a few times a week with an early dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you drink may impact how alcohol affects your body, according to neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson. - skynesher/E+/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;An emerging link between alcohol and dementia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new study looked at data from nearly 560,000 people who participated in the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a longitudinal study that included participants from England, Scotland and Wales, and the &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC-2B-2FcGjIObrNSpDAzLgn3dTfioeF6ZLIGlJnAtzhla-2FMB-b5y_sGhGCVpwFe-2F7omibEFFkS2OLk-2BdOXuEASIRdx2x8JgEFQyU0wnkVnFTYr98WHiItd5mAU-2BAp3fGMKwThCzfas-2BIy2J5J2TQRaHk0rY-2BYi8gC68WDt7KNqJGjf671sFq0CreRdLntWVvjhjzWnR4ZK1KbkuSYkyDNH1Oo-2BB3-2FMU1s5Fa3yqYUcB7ngOTRt7Pwv0xvkH0e8v4Q-2BzkUoEa5sYp2n-2BhStbxC8ArvgXgFTf05LkBWEQ4Y0QMkScZSHhM6jcMcBG9TWmNu0OJWyPMSYYPjWljvzcDV-2BLnsODoLlv337JC7gInsDHAyCJ-2BlO0xiPr5XulFb8Z7Bznn7JViXW4ZFAANpA0dyr-2FGBsN9AheU-3D&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Csandee.lamotte%40cnn.com%7Ca3cadbb3bde44fc3fd1e08ddf77ca15d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638938836851695641%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=MeoB4Om0KaUrNG4480l1FFE2glKRN59KJ2ee8xfgCHw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Million Veteran Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Million Veteran Program&lt;/a&gt;, or MVP, which includes people of European, African and Latin American ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In that observational part of the study, people provided self-reports of how much they drank, and researchers compared alcohol consumption with their risk of developing dementia over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the self-reporting study, people who reported consuming small amounts of alcohol (less than 7 drinks per week) had lower risk than heavy drinkers (more than 40 drinks per week),” said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Interestingly, in this part of the study, non-drinkers and people who reported never drinking actually had similar risk of dementia to people who drank heavily,” said Spires-Jones, who is also a group leader in the UK Dementia Research Institute in London. She was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study then examined genetics from 45 studies of dementia in 2.4 million people and compared genetic markers associated with alcohol use over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher genetic risk was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with a linear increase in dementia risk the higher the alcohol consumption, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There is a 15% higher dementia risk for 3 drinks per week compared to 1 drink per week across life,” Topiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, a doubling in the genetic risk of alcohol dependency was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia,” Spires-Jones said. “But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

It sounds odd, but it's actually a nice combination.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/19/queens-scrambled-eggs-recipe-had-2-very-unusual-ingredients/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.superchargedfood.com/blog/the-queens-favourite-scrambled-eggs-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lee Holmes&lt;/a&gt; claims to have received the Queen’s scrambled egg recipe from a friend who cooked for Elizabeth years ago. While Queen Elizabeth died in 2022, her two-ingredient addition to a classic breakfast dish lives on in people like Steele, who said it’s worth trying for yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I have had fried eggs with lemon slices before, and I love the freshness a bit of citrus brings to eggs,” Steele explained. “Eggs can be a bit flat and neutral in flavor, so the lemon juice really wakes them up. In this case, the freshly-zested lemon peel does the same. It adds an unexpected pop of brightness, which, let's face it, we can all use first thing in the morning.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A little &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chef-carla-hall-says-you-re-juicing-your-citrus-wrong-8677432" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;citrus can be a great way&lt;/a&gt; to freshen up your breakfast plate—that's why we love recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-poppyseed-overnight-oats-11790966" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemon Poppyseed Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259625/carrot-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Carrot Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The nutmeg,” Steele added, “adds a nice, smooth warmth which is a great balance to the acidic zest. I actually love nutmeg in other savory dishes like macaroni and cheese and quiches, as well as sweet breads, scones or muffins, so adding it to scrambled eggs makes perfect sense.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I tried the Queen’s scrambled egg recipe for myself and agree with Steele: Adding some zested lemon and a sprinkle of nutmeg to my normal morning scrambled egg recipe boosted the flavor quite a bit. The tart acidity of the lemon made the eggs taste lighter and brighter, and the nutmeg added a cozy, savory flavor that seemed comforting and perfect for fall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make Queen Elizabeth’s egg recipe, I followed the instructions shared on Lee Holmes’ blog. I whisked three eggs with 1 tablespoon of milk in a bowl and seasoned the mixture with salt. Then I heated 1 tablespoon of butter in a small frying pan over medium heat. When the butter was melted, I added the egg mixture to the pan and turned the heat down to low, occasionally moving them around in the pan with a spatula until nearly set.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When the eggs were just about cooked through, I added a teaspoon of lemon zest and a sprinkle of nutmeg, along with a bit more salt, and gave them one final move around the pan with my spatula to combine. Served with some fresh chives from my herb garden, the dish looked beautiful and tasted great: truly a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/princess-diana-overnight-oats-11798752" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;breakfast fit for a queen&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Together the lemon and nutmeg... play off each other in a really flavorful way,” Steele said of the dish’s flavor profile. "Each bite of the scrambled eggs gives your tongue a pop of the zest and then the nutty notes of nutmeg—an unconventional pairing that works so well.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're looking for a way to upgrade your go-to breakfast, reach for a little citrus and spice for your next scramble. You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised.

Garbanzo walked toward the camera with those adorable tiny paws and little kitten face, looking so small a strong wind could blow him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fast forward to five months later and Garbanzo was taking up half a laundry basket with his much-bigger body. At a full six months old, the Maine Coon had huge paws as well as a fluffy and lush coat. The little kitten face developed into a strong adult countenance. Rather than clumsily walking like an toddler, Garbanzo had a bit of a confident strut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The difference from one to six months was quite remarkable and illustrated how the feline is growing up into a gorgeous and healthy adult cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Kitten Development From 1 to 6 Months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Around the one-month mark, kittens have already experienced substantial physical &lt;a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=dcc541ee-8c02-4e51-9d7c-f8fb0cd9cefd&amp;amp;siteId=us-y4p&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=333ef326-e9f1-3214-87af-ab49a2c89f5a&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=thevets&amp;amp;linkText=development&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RoZXZldHMuY29tL3Jlc291cmNlcy9wZXQtaGVhbHRoLWNhcmUva2l0dGVuLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXN0YWdlcy8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjMzM2VmMzI2LWU5ZjEtMzIxNC04N2FmLWFiNDlhMmM4OWY1YSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly90aGV2ZXRzLmNvbS9yZXNvdXJjZXMvcGV0LWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlL2tpdHRlbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1zdGFnZXMvIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAARhKkTMdWr9qEbLhStF0A43Y4_g4WoXoHI8pPHXgMkoG&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fthevets.com%2Fresources%2Fpet-health-care%2Fkitten-development-stages%2F" rel="nofollow noopener" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:thevets;elmt:" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:development;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:thevets;elmt:;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and become more independent at this stage.

Their adult eye color will begin to emerge, and their vision and hearing are fully developed.

                &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New data suggested that any level of alcohol consumption raised the risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Mendelian randomization analysis found no evidence that moderate drinking protected against dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Findings could mean that even small alcohol amounts may increase population-level dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Drinking any amount of alcohol increased dementia risk, data from a combined observational and genetic study suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light alcohol consumption was associated with low dementia risk in observational analyses, and genetic analyses showed a monotonic increasing dementia risk with higher alcohol intake, reported Anya Topiwala, DPhil, of the University of Oxford in England, and co-authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendelian randomization suggested a causal role of alcohol consumption in increasing dementia risk with no evidence supporting a protective effect at any consumption level, Topiwala and colleagues wrote in &lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjebm-2025-113913" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Mendelian randomization analyses give more confidence that alcohol  --  even in small doses  --  can cause an increase in dementia risk on a population level, rather than only for certain individuals," Topiwala told &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using genetics to investigate alcohol-dementia links means there is less risk of a spurious factor like socioeconomic status, for example, being responsible," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Despite great efforts, we still do not have accessible treatments to treat dementia and prevention is key," Topiwala continued. "Alcohol consumption is widespread across the population, so our findings showing even small amounts of alcohol could increase dementia risk have great relevance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info" target="_blank"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; say that drinking less alcohol is better than drinking more and individuals who do not drink alcohol should not start drinking for any reason. Alcohol guidance is expected to be updated this year to incorporate data from an &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" target="_blank"&gt;evidence review&lt;/a&gt; by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the World Health Organization issued a statement that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health" target="_blank"&gt;no amount of alcohol is safe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some analyses have suggested there might be an optimal dose of alcohol for brain health but many of those studies focused on older adults or didn't differentiate between former and lifelong non-drinkers, Topiwala and colleagues noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To circumvent this, the researchers used data from two large-scale population-based cohorts: the &lt;a href="https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Million Veteran Program&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;U.K. Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. Genetic analyses used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample included 559,559 adults ages 56 to 72 years at baseline. Most people reported drinking alcohol. Mean follow-up was 4 years for the U.S. cohort and 12 years for the U.K. cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the number of self-reported weekly drinks, the presence or absence of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and data about risky drinking from an AUD screen. They adjusted findings for demographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and physical and psychiatric health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three genetic measures related to alcohol use were used as exposures in the Mendelian analysis: self-reported weekly drinks (641 independent genetic variants), risky drinking (80 variants), and alcohol dependency (66 variants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident all-cause dementia was determined through health records. During follow-up, 14,540 participants developed dementia and 48,034 died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational analysis showed a U-shaped association between dementia and drinking. Compared with light drinkers (fewer than 7 drinks a week), heavy drinkers who had 40 or more drinks a week had a 41% increase in dementia risk. This rose to a 51% higher risk among people with AUD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Mendelian randomization analysis, no U-shaped association or protective effect of low alcohol intake levels emerged. One standard deviation increase in drinks per week was associated with a 15% dementia increase. A twofold increase in AUD prevalence was tied to a 16% increase in dementia risk. Dementia risk steadily increased with more genetically predicted drinking, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia, but this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain," observed Tara Spires-Jones, DPhil, of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in comments posted to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-the-association-between-any-amount-of-alcohol-consumption-and-risk-of-dementia/" target="_blank"&gt;U.K. Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who developed dementia typically drank less in the years leading up to their diagnosis, suggesting that reverse causation  --  cognitive decline leading to reduced alcohol consumption  --  may underlie the protective effects of alcohol found in observational studies, Topiwala and co-authors suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results "challenge the notion that low levels of alcohol are neuroprotective," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study findings support a detrimental effect of all types of alcohol consumption on dementia risk, with no evidence supporting the previously suggested protective effect of moderate drinking," they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest statistical associations were found in people of European ancestry due to the numbers of participants of this ethnic heritage in the study, the researchers acknowledged. Mendelian randomization is based on assumptions that can't be verified, they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even light drinking offers no protective benefits, and the risk increases with the amount consumed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major study published in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Evidence Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt; suggests that any level of alcohol consumption may raise the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that even light drinking, which earlier observational studies often portrayed as protective, does not appear to reduce risk. Instead, the likelihood of dementia increases steadily as alcohol intake goes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some past research has proposed that there could be an “optimal dose” of alcohol for brain health. However, many of these studies looked mainly at older adults and often failed to separate lifelong non-drinkers from those who had quit drinking, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome these limitations and build stronger evidence, the new research combined observational data with genetic techniques (Mendelian randomization), drawing on two large biological databanks to examine the full spectrum of alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Data Sources and Study Population&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were the &lt;a href="https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;US Million Veteran Program (MVP),&lt;/a&gt; which includes people of European, African, and Latin American ancestry, and the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UK Biobank (&lt;/a&gt;UKB), which includes people of predominantly European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who were aged 56–72 at baseline, were monitored from recruitment until their first dementia diagnosis, death, or the date of last follow-up (December 2019 for MVP and January 2022 for UKB), whichever came first. The average monitoring period was 4 years for the US group, and 12 for the UK group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption was derived from questionnaire responses—over 90% of participants said they drank alcohol—and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) clinical screening tool. This screens for hazardous drinking patterns, including the frequency of binge drinking (6 or more drinks at a time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, 559,559 participants from both groups were included in observational analyses, 14,540 of whom developed dementia of any type during the monitoring period:10,564 in the US group; and 3976 in the UK group. And 48,034 died: 28,738 in the US group and 19,296 in the UK group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational analyses revealed U-shaped associations between alcohol and dementia risk: compared with light drinkers (fewer than 7 drinks a week) a 41% higher risk was observed among non-drinkers and heavy drinkers consuming 40 or more drinks a week, rising to a 51% higher risk among those who were alcohol dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Genetic Analyses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendelian randomization genetic analyses drew on key data from multiple large individual genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of dementia, involving a total of 2.4 million participants to ascertain lifetime (rather than current) genetically predicted risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendelian randomization leverages genetic data, minimizing the impact of other potentially influential factors, to estimate causal effects: genomic risk for a trait (in this case, alcohol consumption) essentially stands in for the trait itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three genetic measures related to alcohol use were used as different exposures, to study the impact on dementia risk of alcohol quantity, as well as problematic and dependent drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These exposures were: self-reported weekly drinks (641 independent genetic variants); problematic ‘risky’ drinking (80 genetic variants); and alcohol dependency (66 genetic variants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher genetic risk for all 3 exposure levels was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with a linear increase in dementia risk the higher the alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an extra 1-3 drinks a week was associated with a 15% higher risk. And a doubling in the genetic risk of alcohol dependency was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;No Protective Effect Detected&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no U-shaped association was found between alcohol intake and dementia, and no protective effects of low levels of alcohol intake were observed. Instead, dementia risk steadily increased with more genetically predicted drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, those who went on to develop dementia typically drank less over time in the years preceding their diagnosis, suggesting that reverse causation—whereby early cognitive decline leads to reduced alcohol consumption—underlies the supposed protective effects of alcohol found in previous observational studies, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They acknowledge that a principal limitation of their findings is that the strongest statistical associations were found in people of European ancestry, because of the number of participants of this ethnic heritage studied. Mendelian randomization also relies on assumptions that can’t be verified, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they suggest that their findings “challenge the notion that low levels of alcohol are neuroprotective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they conclude: “Our study findings support a detrimental effect of all types of alcohol consumption on dementia risk, with no evidence supporting the previously suggested protective effect of moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pattern of reduced alcohol use before dementia diagnosis observed in our study underscores the complexity of inferring causality from observational data, especially in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of considering reverse causation and residual confounding in studies of alcohol and dementia, and they suggest that reducing alcohol consumption may be an important strategy for dementia prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the medical community once looked to an influential federal vaccine panel for guidance on immunizations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the discussions and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine panel veered from scientific consensus last week — and toward the vaccine-skeptical beliefs of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — many experts are looking elsewhere.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It used to be that the CDC was the No. 1 public health agency in this world,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “That’s not true anymore.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once a panel full of leading experts in epidemiology, vaccine research and statistics has been replaced by Kennedy, for the most part, with figures who have doubted core public health tenets and spread misinformation, according to Offit.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has recommended against a &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/health-now/experts-help-explain-new-federal-vaccine-guidelines-for-childhood-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/health-now/experts-help-explain-new-federal-vaccine-guidelines-for-childhood-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-pharmacy-board-broadens-access-to-covid-19-shots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;discouraged covid-19 shots&lt;/a&gt; for healthy individuals and &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/the-public-in-jeopardy-experts-react-to-rfk-jr-s-cancellation-of-vaccine-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;defunded research into the technology&lt;/a&gt; that can quickly produce new vaccines.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To varying degrees, these actions fly in the face of broadly held views in health care, prompting medical organizations to issue independent guidance and muddying the waters on how providers should prescribe and give treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health on Monday, for instance, explicitly &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-wary-of-federal-guidance-turns-to-medical-groups-for-vaccine-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;called on doctors&lt;/a&gt; to turn to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for vaccine guidance — not federal authorities.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those recommendations typically align with federal recommendations, but not entirely at this point,” Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Debra Bogen told TribLive on Tuesday. “That is exactly the reason we put out our guidance: to try to guide people to trusted, evidence-based sources.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘It wasn’t good for anybody’s health’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines haven’t been the only area of interest for federal health officials.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, President Donald Trump connected Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism in children. He said the Food and Drug Administration would begin notifying doctors that acetaminophen, Tylenol’s active ingredient, “can be associated” with an increased risk of autism — despite not providing a reason for the new recommendation.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement left some of the medical community aghast.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the single most irresponsible and dangerous press conference regarding public health in presidential history,” Offit said. “It wasn’t good for anybody’s health.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have repeatedly examined a possible link between Tylenol and autism and found an association, according to Devon Ramaeker, division director of maternal-fetal medicine at Allegheny Health Network’s Women’s Institute.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean the over-the-counter pain reliever causes developmental conditions, she said, noting that autism stems from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that autism is likely a very complex diagnosis that has a lot of potential reasons it may occur,” she said. “And simplifying it down to a single cause, risk factor or exposure is oversimplifying the diagnosis.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could definitely lead to adverse outcomes, according to Ramaeker, is a pregnant woman deciding to “tough it out” when they have a fever, as Trump suggested, rather than taking Tylenol. Untreated fevers in pregnant women bring a higher risk of birth defects during the first trimester, including a spinal cord condition that can cause severe disability.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit put it this way: “All the data is on the side of fever is bad for you in the first trimester, and Tylenol doesn’t increase your incidence of autism.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviews of Monday’s news conference weren’t all bad.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Carosso, an autism specialist with multiple offices in Southwestern Pennsylvania, said Trump and Kennedy are right to frame rising autism diagnoses as a crisis.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s such a tremendous travesty,” he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Carosso sees rising cases of autism, other medical experts see a more robust and inclusive diagnostic framework that better recognizes the condition in women and minority groups.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carosso isn’t sure whether the Tylenol connection is legitimate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting to the bottom of this will be a challenge, in his view, “because it comes from the Trump administration, (so) it’s going to be immediately refuted” by a large swath of medical experts.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;‘United the medical and scientific community’&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, a Pittsburgh-based infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he reads the data himself to determine what is going on in terms of vaccines.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would not trust anything that Kennedy has control over,” Adalja said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes several key authorities, including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the FDA, all of which dictate the country’s health guidelines and policies.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some states are trying to fill the void as confidence in federal guidance wanes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania announced Thursday it had joined Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York State, Rhode Island and New York City to launch the &lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-joins-northeast-state-health-coalition-as-cdc-shakeups-concern-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Northeast Public Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/pa-joins-northeast-state-health-coalition-as-cdc-shakeups-concern-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition will “protect the health, safety and well-being of all residents by providing information based on science, data, and evidence, while working to ensure equitable access to vaccines, medications and services,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/newsroom/launch-northeast-public-health-collaborative" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; for the state.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization held its first meeting in August, where it started identifying opportunities to work together on public health emergency preparedness and response as well as vaccine schedules.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offit called Monday’s news conference a jolt for some within the medical establishment.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really united the medical and scientific community,” Offit said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Confusion and repercussions&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting guidelines have left patients and doctors with conflicting information.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Infectious Disease Society of America and states have created their own expert advisory bodies to make recommendations that they think are based on good data and are therefore good practices — the problem is it’s become fragmented. So people are unclear what exactly to look at,” Offit said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Offit, the answer is for doctors to look to guidance from their corresponding medical association. For example, pediatricians should abide by American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confusion has also led doctors to be unsure about what insurance companies will cover, he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Health Department said residents will continue to get insurance coverage for shots recommended by the CDC as of last year. It’s not clear when insurers might change vaccine coverage, if they desired.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such an uncertain landscape, patients are best served consulting medical professionals, according to Ramaeker.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really think that for patients this can be a confusing time, and I think they need to rely on their medical providers to make informed decisions for them, in conjunction with them,” Ramaeker said.

&lt;/p&gt;

"Being young, healthy and female does not guarantee immunity from heart attack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist emphasized the importance of listening to your body and realizing that no one is immune from a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle, exercise, avoid smoking and know the status of any chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol," a doctor advised.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to maintain a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, exercise, avoid smoking and know the status of any chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol," he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most effective advocate is a well-informed patient," Serwer added.

The results did not paint a pretty picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The mice, especially the older ones, started to show behavioral changes eerily similar to dementia. The plastic particles crossed the blood-brain barrier, causing inflammation in the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jaime Ross, the study's lead author, told the Post she was alarmed by how quickly the changes took place, saying: "I'm still really surprised by it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This isn't just an isolated finding. The concern is that these plastic particles could be an environmental trigger for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Research Communications found that when mice with a high-risk gene for Alzheimer's, APOE4, were exposed to microplastics, they showed significant cognitive and behavioral changes that weren't seen in mice without the gene. This suggests that microplastics could interact with genetic predispositions to accelerate disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is made worse by daily exposure. We're constantly in contact with plastics, and another study has raised concerns about cytotoxicity from microplastics, especially from food containers that are heated or cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the science is alarming, the good news is that people are tackling this problem from every angle. It starts with simple choices, and there's a lot of &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helpful information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;helpful information&lt;/a&gt; available on how to use less plastic in our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Innovation is also providing hope. To get these particles out of our environment, researchers have developed a new kind of filter designed to catch even the smallest bits of plastic that usually slip through water treatment systems. For plastics already in our bodies, scientists have discovered a promising new way to filter microplastics out of human blood using a method similar to dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the fight to protect our health, another study found that powerful antioxidants found in many fruits and flowers can counteract some of the dangerous effects that microplastic exposure can have on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the link between microplastics and cognitive decline is deeply concerning, emerging scientific breakthroughs in filtering our water, cleansing our bodies, and using natural compounds to protect our health offer a hopeful path forward in tackling the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec7QW0GpshZ5tm1o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNUGZDTHp6YW1rNHBPSmU5cllIMkJkOWhqWUpCbzRnUzNWXzJBQ01iR3VWTkRHMGgweU41cnFiWEdkVVEydG9JOGlDQmJqc2J0cEVnOTNuNmwzMFo5eGt1MTRBczk5VDAzTldPNldkOTdWM1JnenFCYkNZQzRVR0R3aFJiS2c3Z3U5MWdDR0s5MWUxWlpjSzYtWTY1TXNqQQ</guid></item><item><title>受影响的寡妇在他们最喜欢的海滩的小牛水中划桨后，因食肉细菌而失去了丈夫-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15127087/Virginia-Beach-vibrio-bacteria-infection-dead-husband.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A devastated widow has shared how she lost her husband to flesh-eating bacteria after he paddled in calf-deep water at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-a2274230-98c0-11f0-824e-2fed9f798c67"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; beach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joyce D'Arcy and her husband, Derek, took a trip to the classic vacation spot in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They waded in the water and did not even go up to their knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that was all it took for a bacteria called vibrio vulnificus to make it into a small, open cut on Derek's leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Virginia Beach was our absolute favorite place to go,' D'Arcy told &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-world/teachers-lesson-deadly-bacteria-vibrio/507-bc3404bf-30d6-45d1-aac7-284be29cd62e"&gt;WTSP&lt;/a&gt;. 'So its just so sad that the best place that we had is where he got sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four days after the couple's trip to the beach, D'Arcy noticed a purple stripe on her husband's leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The husband and wife sent his blood for testing, but by the time the test came back positive for vibrio another three days later, the infection had already spread across both his legs, causing severe damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Derek had a weakened immune system due to being on dialysis, which D'Arcy believes contributed to the rapid spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors determined that the only way to save Derek was by amputating his legs to stop the infection from spreading. Sadly, they didn't act quickly enough and just 12 hours after the surgery, the vibrio bacteria had spread Derek's chest, hands and head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that point, 'we knew we lost the fight,' D'Arcy said. Her husband would die around a week later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joyce D'Arcy and her husband, Derek, took a seemingly harmless trip to Virginia Beach where the husband was infected with a flesh-eating bacteria that would take his life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Virginia Beach (pictured) was the couple's 'absolute favorite place to go'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vibrio infections are surprisingly common, and experts say one in five people who are infected will die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The widow hopes her story can serve as a warning to others about how quickly a person can die to the aggressive, flesh-eating bacteria and that awareness can save another family from experiencing a similar tragic and unexpected loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cleveland Clinic doctors say vibrio is more common than people think, especially in the warmer months of May through October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections happen fairly often.  Most people survive but symptoms are very painful and many sufferers must face having limbs amputated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14983485/Deadly-flesh-eating-bacteria-spread-beaches-cases-surge-terrifying-rise.html"&gt;cases of vibrio infection rose into the double digits&lt;/a&gt; along the Gulf Coast and further up Atlantic Coast.  Experts believe the rising infections are caused by warming waters as the bacteria thrives in waters between 68 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15065795/florida-mom-death-flesh-eating-bacteria-beach.html"&gt;a mother was left fighting for her life and almost lost her leg&lt;/a&gt; after contracting vibrio when she swam at Quietwater Beach in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also earlier this month,&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-15056609/Vibrio-vulnificus-flesh-eating-bacteria-florida.html"&gt; a father contracted a vibrio infection after a fishing trip&lt;/a&gt;, which caused serious swelling and a burning sensation in his foot and ankle. It took three surgeries for doctors to stop the spread of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control estimates that one in five people who are infected with vibrio will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="333" data-end="597"&gt;We live in a world where women are praised for being “strong” and “resilient.” On the outside, it looks like they’ve got it together—juggling careers, families, friendships, and everything in between. But here’s the truth: strength can sometimes mask exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="599" data-end="822"&gt;I’ve seen it in my own circles—women smiling through clenched teeth, showing up for everyone else while quietly running on empty. And maybe you’ve felt it yourself: that tug between appearing fine and actually being okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="824" data-end="1009"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always announce itself with a dramatic breakdown. More often, it slips in quietly, disguised as everyday habits and coping strategies. That’s why it’s so easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;If you’ve been wondering whether you—or someone you love—might be silently struggling, here are nine subtle signs to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1150" data-end="1181"&gt;1. She laughs everything off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1183" data-end="1415"&gt;Humor can be a brilliant coping tool. It allows us to soften the heaviness of life and connect with others. But when every struggle is brushed aside with a joke or a quick laugh, it may be less about joy and more about deflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1417" data-end="1625"&gt;I once caught myself laughing while telling a friend, “Oh, I barely slept all week, but who needs rest, right?” The truth was, I was completely depleted. That kind of humor isn’t lighthearted—it’s a shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1627" data-end="1964"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.peacheycounselling.ca/blog/the-mental-health-effects-of-masking-how-you-feel?.com"&gt;“masking,”&lt;/a&gt; and it often prevents deeper conversations. Friends and coworkers hear the joke and move on, never realizing there’s pain beneath the surface. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice the humor doesn’t quite land as joy—it lands as avoidance. And avoidance is one of burnout’s favorite hiding spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1971" data-end="2000"&gt;2. She’s always “too busy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2002" data-end="2157"&gt;Ever notice how some women keep their calendars packed to the brim? Work meetings, social gatherings, errands, volunteer work—anything to stay in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2159" data-end="2412"&gt;On the surface, it looks like ambition. But sometimes busyness is just burnout in disguise. When you’re constantly running from one task to another, there’s no space left to sit with uncomfortable feelings. Busyness becomes a distraction from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2414" data-end="2759"&gt;As Rudá Iandê notes in &lt;em data-start="2437" data-end="2500"&gt;&lt;a class="decorated-link" href="https://thevessel.io/laughing-in-the-face-of-chaos-book/" target="_new" rel="noopener" data-start="2438" data-end="2499"&gt;Laughing in the Face of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, “the more we try to escape or numb the chaos within, the more powerful the currents become.” His words hit me hard because I used to fill every spare hour just to avoid slowing down. Stillness can feel scary when your emotions are screaming for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2761" data-end="2931"&gt;Here’s the paradox: the very thing that looks like high functioning is often a sign that someone is hanging on by a thread. She’s not thriving—she’s outrunning herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2938" data-end="2985"&gt;3. Her sleep patterns are all over the place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3165"&gt;Sleep is often the first casualty of burnout. She may collapse into bed early but wake at 3 a.m. with racing thoughts. Or she may stay up late scrolling, dreading the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3167" data-end="3349"&gt;Sleep disruption doesn’t just mean feeling groggy in the morning. It means her nervous system is stuck in overdrive. Even when her body begs for rest, her mind refuses to shut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3351" data-end="3545"&gt;I’ve been there—lying in bed, exhausted but wired, rehearsing tomorrow’s to-do list over and over. For women pretending to be fine, poor sleep becomes the quiet evidence that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3547" data-end="3778"&gt;Research consistently &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/1/e012816?.com"&gt;links burnout to insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and left unchecked, it creates a vicious cycle. The less she sleeps, the more drained she becomes—and the harder it gets to admit she’s struggling. Burnout thrives in that silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3785" data-end="3823"&gt;4. She avoids talking about herself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3825" data-end="4004"&gt;Have you ever noticed how some women are brilliant at steering the spotlight away from themselves? Ask how they’re doing and suddenly you’re talking about your own life instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4006" data-end="4212"&gt;This isn’t just politeness. It’s self-protection. Talking about herself might open the door to emotions she’s not ready to face. So she avoids vulnerability and instead turns the conversation back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4214" data-end="4415"&gt;It’s easy to mistake this for being “selfless” or “a great listener.” But if you scratch beneath the surface, it’s often a way of hiding. Pretending to be “fine” feels safer than admitting she’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4417" data-end="4558"&gt;This is one of the trickiest signs because it often looks like strength. But avoidance, in this case, is exhaustion wearing a polite smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4565" data-end="4598"&gt;5. She downplays her struggles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4600" data-end="4784"&gt;A woman might casually mention, “I’ve just been a little tired lately,” when in reality she’s hanging on by a thread. Or she might frame serious stress as “just one of those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4786" data-end="5048"&gt;This isn’t denial—it’s survival. Admitting the full weight of her exhaustion feels overwhelming, so she minimizes it. Unfortunately, the more she downplays, the more isolated she becomes. Others assume she doesn’t need help, and the cycle of silence continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5050" data-end="5363"&gt;This is where Rudá Iandê’s insight rings true: “When we let go of the need to be perfect, we free ourselves to live fully—embracing the mess, complexity, and richness of a life that's delightfully real.” I’ve noticed how often women feel pressure to be “low-maintenance,” as though asking for support is a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5365" data-end="5438"&gt;But constant minimization is not strength—it’s a quiet cry for support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5445" data-end="5478"&gt;6. Her body carries the weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5480" data-end="5617"&gt;Burnout rarely stays in the mind. It makes its home in the body: tension headaches, tight shoulders, stomach issues, unexplained aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5619" data-end="5799"&gt;I once went through months of stress that showed up as constant migraines. It took me ages to realize my body was trying to tell me what my mouth wouldn’t say: “You’re not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;Experts in somatic psychology emphasize that our bodies speak for us when we won’t. A woman insisting she’s fine while constantly battling physical symptoms isn’t lying—she may genuinely not connect the dots yet. But the body rarely lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5801" data-end="6041"&gt;A recent Swedish study found that people with high burnout &lt;a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2%3A1742868/FULLTEXT01.pdf?.com"&gt;report many somatic symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—headaches, back pain, stomach problems, trouble sleeping—far more often than people without burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6043" data-end="6195"&gt;When physical pain becomes routine and excuses like “just stress” or “nothing serious” get repeated, it’s worth asking whether burnout has taken root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6202" data-end="6230"&gt;7. She withdraws socially&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6452"&gt;On paper, she’s still present—she shows up at gatherings, sends birthday texts, maybe even posts on social media. But her engagement is surface-level. Conversations feel flat. She’s there, but she’s not &lt;em data-start="6435" data-end="6443"&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6454" data-end="6616"&gt;Emotional burnout can make even lighthearted interactions feel draining. So while she might maintain appearances, she may quietly dread every social obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6618" data-end="6759"&gt;The irony? Many women fear that pulling back entirely will “let people down.” So they perform presence while secretly longing for solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6761" data-end="6915"&gt;Withdrawal doesn’t always look like disappearing. Sometimes it looks like her being “fine” in public and collapsing in private the moment she gets home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6922" data-end="6955"&gt;8. She relies on small escapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6957" data-end="7140"&gt;Wine at night. Endless streaming binges. Scrolling until her eyes blur. None of these things are inherently bad. But when they become daily rituals, it often signals deeper fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7142" data-end="7291"&gt;As one therapist explained in a seminar I attended, avoidance often masquerades as relaxation. What looks like “self-care” may actually be numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7293" data-end="7461"&gt;When the coping strategies pile up—snacks, wine, social media, shopping—it’s not indulgence. It’s a quiet attempt to silence the exhaustion she doesn’t want to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7463" data-end="7656"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always scream—it whispers through little habits that add up over time. Pay attention to what she reaches for at the end of the day. It’s often the clue to what she’s avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7663" data-end="7695"&gt;9. She’s overly accommodating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7850"&gt;Have you met women who always say yes, always bend, always prioritize others? From the outside, it looks generous. But inside, it can feel suffocating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7852" data-end="8062"&gt;I’ve been there myself—saying yes to everyone else while my own needs went unmet. What I learned, painfully, is that people-pleasing often stems from emotional exhaustion. It’s easier to comply than to argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8064" data-end="8317"&gt;As Iandê reminds us, “Being human means inevitably disappointing and hurting others, and the sooner you accept this reality, the easier it becomes to navigate life’s challenges.” A woman constantly saying yes isn’t thriving—she’s running on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8319" data-end="8476"&gt;Over-accommodation may look like compassion, but in reality, it’s a signal she’s too tired to hold boundaries. And boundaries are what keep burnout at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8483" data-end="8500"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8502" data-end="8661"&gt;Burnout doesn’t always look like collapse. Sometimes it looks like a woman smiling, joking, and assuring everyone she’s fine—while quietly unraveling inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8663" data-end="8827"&gt;The danger in ignoring these signs is that burnout compounds. The longer it goes unacknowledged, the harder it is to recover. That’s why awareness is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8829" data-end="8978"&gt;If you see yourself in these patterns, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. Burnout is not a personal failing—it’s a human experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8980" data-end="9209"&gt;Start small. Rest without guilt. Speak honestly, even if your voice shakes. And most importantly, remember this: you don’t have to keep pretending you’re fine. Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is to admit that you’re not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legume-based pasta is the top choice — made from chickpeas, lentils, black beans, or peas, it offers far more fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals than traditional wheat pasta.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition labels matter — experts recommend looking for pasta with at least 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving, plus added nutrients like iron for a more filling and balanced option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taste and use are versatile — chickpea pasta is closest to regular pasta in flavor, while lentil and black bean versions are earthier; all work well in traditional pasta dishes, especially when paired with vegetables and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-shelf-stable-foods-11740097" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pantry staples&lt;/a&gt; go, you can’t go wrong with dried pasta. The ingredient is a base for countless dishes, from classic &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/shellfish-spaghetti-8410404" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Shellfish Spaghetti&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/lemony-linguine-with-olives-and-feta-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemony Linguine With Olives and Feta&lt;/a&gt;. Traditional pasta also mainly consists of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/what-are-refined-carbs" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, which can be an easy source of energy. The drawback? Refined carbs are digested quickly, so you might feel hungry soon after eating pasta.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, you may be looking for a “healthier” pasta with a greater variety of nutrients. To help support your search, we asked three registered dietitians to recommend the healthiest type of pasta you can buy, plus what to look for when shopping for pasta.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with other foods, all types of pasta can be included in a balanced diet, and there’s no harm in enjoying traditional varieties. The “healthiest” type also depends on your goals and needs, per registered dietitian Samantha Peterson, MS, RD.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nynutritiongroup.com/lisa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Moskovitz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RD, CDN, a registered dietitian, founder of NY Nutrition Group, and author of &lt;em&gt;The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://simplywellnessllc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Samantha Peterson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, a registered dietitian and founder of Simply Wellness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But generally, if you’re looking for the most nutrient-dense option, there are some things to consider. “If nutrition is a priority, compare &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;‘nutrition facts’ labels&lt;/a&gt; to see which pasta contains more important nutrients to distinguish the ‘healthier’ option,” suggests registered dietitian Connie Elick, MS, RD. These key nutrients primarily include &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-is-too-much-protein-8407660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which are both essential.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitian Lisa Moskovitz, RD, agrees: “If you’re looking for the most nutritious pasta, you’ll want to beeline to the fiber section first on the food label. Any brand with more than 5 grams of fiber per serving is a great source of this digestion-regulating, heart-healthy, and blood sugar-stabilizing nutrient.” Bonus points if each serving also contains at least 5 grams of muscle-preserving protein, and at least 25 percent of the RDA for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, Moskovitz points out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthiest-type-of-pasta"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Healthiest Type of Pasta &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, which type of pasta checks all these boxes? According to the three dietitians we interviewed, legume-based pasta is one of the best choices.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the name suggests, legume-based pasta is made with legumes rather than wheat. This may include &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chickpeas-nutrition-6744549" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-black-beans-7254820" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;black beans&lt;/a&gt;, and red, green, or yellow lentils, notes Peterson. “Some brands also blend in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/health-benefits-of-peas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/edamame-nutrition" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt;,” she adds. And per Peterson, each legume offers its own subtle flavor and nutrient profile, but they’re all naturally rich in fiber and plant-based protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For context, legume pasta contains about five times more fiber than traditional white flour pasta, per Moskovitz. Here’s why that’s noteworthy: “Fiber is your gut’s best friend,” Moskovitz explains. “It keeps &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestion running smoothly&lt;/a&gt;, feeds good bacteria, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-lifestyle-habits-11769931" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; for the average healthy adult,” she adds. Fiber also balances blood glucose levels and lowers cholesterol, says Elick. What’s more, “it helps to make you feel full sooner and longer, creating a sense of satiety that can help with weight management or weight loss,” Elick adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the protein department, legume pasta shines too. According to Peterson, a serving can pack 12 to 20 grams of protein—at least double the amount found in traditional pasta. “Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting muscle strength, building metabolism, and keeping you full and satisfied longer,” says Peterson. It also supports a variety of biological processes, including &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, hormone regulation, and DNA repair, per Elick.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, legume-based pasta offers more minerals and vitamins than standard versions. “Many legume-based pastas contain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-iron-than-steak-11793217" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based iron&lt;/a&gt;, which helps your body transport oxygen and maintain steady energy,” shares Peterson. They also offer &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/folate-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;folate&lt;/a&gt;, which are involved in muscle function, blood pressure balance, and DNA synthesis, respectively.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, legume pastas are typically higher in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy to boost your intake of these key molecules. “Antioxidants fight inflammation and protect the body against chronic degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease,” says Moskovitz.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In general, you can swap regular pasta for the legume kind in all your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-pasta-recipes-7971375" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pasta recipes&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s worth noting that legume pasta tends to have a heartier, slightly nuttier taste, and a smoother bite, notes Peterson. “Chickpea pasta is the mildest—closest to regular pasta—while lentil or black bean versions can have a more earthy flavor. The texture is often denser, which makes the dish feel more filling,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pro tip: “For the most balanced plate, pair legume pasta with colorful veggies and a drizzle of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/olive-oil-health-benefits-8754789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil,&lt;/a&gt;” recommends Peterson. The vegetables add antioxidants and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vegetables-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange-11768257" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which supports iron absorption from legumes. Meanwhile, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; (from the olive oil) help your body absorb fat-soluble nutrients, Peterson points out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But remember, you don’t need to completely ditch white pasta or stick to legume varieties for optimal health. Instead, you can consider legume pasta whenever you’re looking for a boost of nutrients and satiety.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Publix and Walgreens pharmacies in Florida will begin administering the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines to eligible patients without a prescription. They join CVS and CVS Minute Clinic, which had already been administering the shots — although with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said its Florida pharmacies are well stocked with booster shots and customers can make appointments on its portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In accordance with FDA approval, we offer the vaccine to all adults 65 years and older, as well as to individuals under 65 who are at higher risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19, as determined by the CDC,” Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://floridaspharmacy.gov/"&gt; Florida Board of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; met on Tuesday and advised that under existing statutes and rules, pharmacists, interns, and technicians in Florida may administer FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines to eligible individuals 18 years and older under specific protocols. That means anyone 65 years of age and older are eligible to receive the vaccines, as well as individuals 64 years of age and younger with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Publix pharmacies are now accepting walk-ins for eligible patients, and we will begin offering appointments later today for as early as tomorrow,” Publix spokeswoman Lindsey Willis said Tuesday. Publix has 800 pharmacy locations in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both CVS and Walgreens representatives say their companies will ask patients under age 65 if they have any of these factors. They won’t require proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In simplest terms, if a patient says they’re eligible, they will get the vaccine,” said  Amy Thibault, the CVS Health spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, though, any restrictions will be lifted, which is good news for Floridians who have been &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/09/covid-flu-rsv-vaccine-confusion-and-frustration-overwhelm-florida/"&gt;frustrated for weeks&lt;/a&gt; in their attempts to get the newest COVID booster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, vaccine advisers picked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/19/covid-vaccines-cdc/"&gt;declined to specifically recommend the shots&lt;/a&gt; but said Americans could make individual decisions on whether to get them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations from the advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require sign-off by the agency’s director, but they are almost always adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the acting CDC director adopts the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)’s recent recommendations, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Florida, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Sweeney had said of Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Walgreens has 1,600 pharmacies in Florida, and some locations offer Moderna shots, while others provide Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people start seeking vaccinations in the late summer or early fall to get protection against winter surges in cases, as well as for protection on cruises and during other travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, CVS had been the only major retail pharmacy in the state giving out the 2025-2026 COVID booster shots. CVS had been requiring patients to be 65 or older or at risk for severe outcomes — and have a prescription. The CVS MinuteClinic also administered shots with a prescription or allowed a shot if its nurse practitioners prescribed it. Some CVS pharmacies carry the Moderna brand, while others carry Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 vaccine is covered by most insurance plans at no cost for eligible patients,” said Thibault of CVS Health. “Patients should check with their insurer to determine whether the updated COVID-19 vaccine is covered by their individual health plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that most insurers &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/09/23/covid-19-vaccinations-insurance/"&gt;will cover the cost&lt;/a&gt; of the booster — at least through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that the committee vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms.” An HHS spokesperson said that includes Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, commercial coverage sold through health insurance marketplaces, and the federal Vaccines for Children program, which pays for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vaccines for Children program typically automatically covers any vaccines recommended by the CDC’s vaccine committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans said earlier this week that its members will continue to cover the shots at no cost to patients through 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group includes every major insurer except UnitedHealthcare. And that insurer has said it will continue covering the vaccine at no cost for its standard commercial coverage, which includes plans offered for individuals and through small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large employers with their own insurance plans will make their own decisions on the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data presented to the CDC vaccine committee, about two-thirds of adults get COVID-19 shots at pharmacies, and around 30% receive them at doctors’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this season, the U.S. has recommended yearly COVID-19 shots for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Amid an increase in mpox cases, health officials and care providers are urging Chicago residents to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 67 reported cases of mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, in Chicago in the past three months, according to data from the city’s public health department. Three dozen cases were diagnosed last month, an 80% increase over July, the department says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Crone, a physician at Howard Brown Health who specializes in infectious diseases, said he started noticing the uptick in mpox cases in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those concerned about the virus, Crone said the two-dose vaccine remains the most effective preventive measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the recent surge has not risen to the level of the 2022 outbreak, when infections topped a thousand in Chicago amid a global resurgence of mpox, the increase in cases sounds alarms, Crone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is concerning because the number of cases that we’re taking care of are people who have symptoms, that have brought them to the doctor, and we’ve accurately tested them, and the test is positive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crone worries that it may continue to spread from those who have minor symptoms or are unaware of the disease, or be missed during diagnosis by health care providers less experienced with the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mpox spreads through close, personal contact. Sexually active bisexual, gay and same-gender-loving men are most at risk of mpox, Crone said. According to city data, 72% of reported cases from the past three months have been men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms for the virus can include painful rash or sores, most pronounced at body entrances like the mouth and genitals, Crone said. They may also come with flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue and swollen glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with mpox recover within two to four weeks without medical treatment. Chicago’s health department recommends drinking water and keeping areas of rash and sores dry and clean, without scratching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the majority of patients, it’s just taking care of yourself until it gets better on its own,” Crone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in mpox cases comes as the federal government is enacting sweeping changes to vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of vaccine advisers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Friday to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines, making it more difficult for especially older adults to receive the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order aiming to protect access to routine vaccinations like COVID-19, flu, polio and measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s Immunization Advisory Committee also voted Monday to recommend updated COVID-19 vaccines to most Illinois residents.

Many also do not have health insurance, which means they pay out of pocket any time they go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;He added that it‚Äôs hard to compare the study‚Äôs prevalence rate with the general population because the study only looked at Amish children and did not use the same autism screening tool to assess the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That would be like giving different tests to students in a class and then trying to rank them by their scores.

								&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health announced Monday it will break from federal guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine and endorse the recommendations of medical associations instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s panel of vaccine advisers opted not to give any recommendation on the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine, saying instead it’s an individual choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/?p=3755105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine advisers change COVID shot guidance, calling them an individual choice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices this year and replace them with his handpicked appointees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, MDH officials are endorsing the advice of three independent medical associations: the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836/AAP-recommends-all-young-and-high-risk-children?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, these associations recommend that all people six months and older should be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine unhindered, with strong recommendations for children from six to 23 months, pregnant women, and children and adults with high-risk conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDH Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said her agency is “following the science” by endorsing the advice of these health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a unique moment where vaccine information from federal health leaders leaves important information gaps for Minnesotans,” Cunningham said. “These independent medical associations have all looked at the science and concluded that COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective and important for people across the lifespan.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://kstp.com/health-medical/as-trump-administration-clamps-down-on-vaccines-walz-signs-order-to-expand-access/"&gt;As Trump administration clamps down on vaccines, Walz signs order to expand access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MDH’s COVID-19 vaccine guidance, which includes &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/immunize/hcp/pharmacists.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;standing orders for pharmacists&lt;/a&gt;, comes after Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order this month aimed at safeguarding vaccine access in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
