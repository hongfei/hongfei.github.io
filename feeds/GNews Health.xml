What you put on your plate every day plays a huge role in how your skin ages. In fact, some foods we casually snack on or sip with friends are secretly speeding up fine lines, dullness, and sagging. They don’t scream “bad for your skin” the way greasy fast food might, but they’re quietly working against you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this important to know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intake of added sugar is increasing these days. For example, as per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/added-sugar-in-the-diet/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;report, on average, Americans consume about 17 teaspoons (roughly 68 grams) of added sugar every day. This equates to approximately 270 calories from added sugars daily—much higher than the recommended limits set by experts. Leading sources of this added sugar are sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweet snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edson Brandao, a 58 year old biohacker took to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNQUsuLoHo1/?igsh=NHV3YXgxc204bG4w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;to share 7 foods that silently damages our skin and pushes it towards early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Watch out some everyday treats might be working against you. Sneaky skin agers like sugar, soda, and ice cream don’t just taste sweet… they can accelerate wrinkles and steal your radiance," he warns his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ice cream breaks down collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice cream may be comforting, but it’s secretly rough on your skin. All that sugar creates something called advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which break down collagen and elastin—the proteins that keep your skin firm and bouncy. Without them, skin gets saggy and fine lines pop up faster. Plus, the dairy can trigger inflammation or acne for some people, leaving skin looking less clear. The combo of sugar and dairy is like a double hit to your glow, making ice cream more of a wrinkle-creator than a beauty booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cola dehydrates your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cola feels refreshing, but it’s actually dehydrating your skin. The high caffeine content acts like a diuretic, meaning it makes your body lose water faster. Dehydrated skin looks dull, tired, and more prone to fine lines. On top of that, cola is loaded with sugar, which damages collagen, speeding up wrinkles and sagging. The acidity can also weaken your teeth, taking away from your overall youthful look. Basically, every sip gives you a quick energy rush but quietly steals your skin’s bounce and brightness. Swap it out with sparkling water if you want glow instead of dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruit juices have added sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though fruit juice sounds healthy, most store-bought versions are loaded with sugar—sometimes as much as soda! That sugar spikes your blood glucose, leading to glycation, which weakens collagen and elastin. Over time, skin loses firmness and elasticity, showing wrinkles sooner. To make things worse, fruit juice lacks the fiber of whole fruit, so you’re just getting a big sugar dump without the benefits. This sugar rush also creates inflammation, which can worsen acne or redness. While fresh juice in moderation is fine, guzzling it daily can definitely fast-track dullness, sagging, and premature skin aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Margarine reduce skin hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margarine used to be marketed as the “healthy” butter swap, but it’s actually loaded with trans fats. These fats can stiffen cell membranes and reduce skin hydration, leaving you with dry, rough-looking skin. Even worse, they may damage collagen, which is your skin’s natural scaffolding. Without strong collagen, fine lines and sagging show up faster. Some studies even connect trans fats with increased inflammation, which makes skin more vulnerable to breakouts and redness. So, while margarine might spread smoothly on toast, it’s not doing your face any favors—it’s more like spreading wrinkles over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Artificial sweeteners can cause inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners might seem like a smart sugar hack, but they can mess with your skin in sneaky ways. They confuse your body, triggering insulin responses even without actual sugar, which can lead to inflammation. That inflammation shows up on your skin as dullness, breakouts, or redness. Some studies also suggest sweeteners can mess with gut health, and since your gut is tied to your skin, that imbalance may speed up aging. While they don’t directly cause glycation like real sugar, they still mess with your skin’s natural balance, making your complexion look less smooth and youthful over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muffins weaken collagen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muffins might look innocent (especially the blueberry ones that scream “healthy”), but they’re really little sugar bombs. The refined flour and sugar combo spikes blood sugar, leading to glycation that weakens collagen. That means skin starts sagging earlier, with wrinkles creeping in faster. Plus, most muffins are made with unhealthy oils that add to inflammation, making skin dull and puffy. What feels like a cozy morning treat is really a hit to your skin’s glow. Eat them often enough, and your skin will show it—trading radiance for tiredness. Basically, muffins are dessert in disguise, and your face knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol dehydrates the skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol might make you feel relaxed, but your skin pays the price. It’s a powerful dehydrator, which leaves your skin looking dry, flat, and more lined. Dehydrated skin shows wrinkles more easily and loses that fresh glow. Alcohol also inflames your skin, which can worsen redness, puffiness, or conditions like rosacea. Over time, it messes with vitamin A levels too—an essential nutrient for skin repair. Without enough of it, your skin struggles to renew itself, so signs of aging show up faster. A glass here and there is fine, but too much drinking leaves your face looking older, sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Give your skin the love it deserves by ditching these culprits and choosing nourishment that works for you—not against you.

To see how Banting's diet holds up in the 21st century, fitness YouTuber William Tennyson (pictured) decided to give it a go&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, ideally, you'd want your immune system to just be absolutely 100 percent. I don't think this [drink] would do it. I think this is just an excuse to have sugar and alcohol in the morning. Dare I say an energy drink is healthier.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving on to breakfast, Tennyson rustles up a feast in line with what Banting would have eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his diet book, Banting wrote: 'For breakfast, I take four or five ounces of beef, mutton, kidneys, broiled fish, bacon, or cold meat of any kind except pork; a large cup of tea (without milk or sugar), a little biscuit, or one ounce of dry toast.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This restriction of pork stemmed from a belief at the time that it contained starch and saccharine matter, which Banting and his medical adviser, William Harvey, believed contributed to the creation of fat and hindered weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson said that it is easy to understand why Banting lost weight with such a 'sad looking' breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the mutton (aged lamb) tastes 'very earthy' and 'like I'm licking a barn door.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he noted he was happy to see some protein on his plate to kick off the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies consistently show that increasing your protein intake is one of the most effective strategies for promoting satiety and helping with weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, some carbohydrates such as pastries and pasta, don't keep you full because they are refined or processed, causing rapid blood sugar spikes and crashes that lead to hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 19th century, what is now called lunch was generally known as dinner, and it was the largest meal of the day, served in the early afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his food diary, Banting said for 'dinner' he enjoyed: 'Five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira - champagne, port and beer forbidden.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Banting excluded salmon as it is considered one of the fattiest fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mirroring this medley, Tennyson made a meal with cod, Brussel sprouts, and a piece of dry toast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For dessert, he interpreted 'fruit out of a pudding' as a dish made with strawberries and whipped cream and as a drink, he opts for sherry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most modern-day diets generally recommend limiting or avoiding alcohol, Tennyson was surprised to see that alcohol is a running theme with the Banting diet, with up to seven glasses permitted per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The calorie count of wine varies significantly based on its alcohol content and sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a standard five ounce (150ml) glass of dry table wine typically ranges from 120 to 130 calories, while dessert wines and fortified wines like sherry can have a much higher calorie density. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dry sherries are low in sugar and calories, while sweet or cream sherries are much higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As he sipped the sherry, Tennyson mused: 'Dude has the priorities of a seasoned pirate. Or you want to know what? Maybe this was safer to drink than water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For breakfast, Tennyson dined on mutton, a biscuit and tea without milk and sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;William Banting, who was an funeral director living in London during the mid-19th century, claimed to have lost 52 pounds by adhering to a low-carb diet. Astounded by the results, he printed his weight loss secrets in a booklet titled Letter On Corpulence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his midday meal, Tennyson went for a 'gentle walk' before returning home for  'tea' which comprised 'two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk (a light, dry biscuit) or two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Banting diet was mainly concerned with food intake, with meals every three to four hours, and there is little focus on working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Considering he ate less calories than he usually would, Tennyson said he was surprised how satisfied felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For his final meal of the day, 'supper,'  Tennyson opts for chicken in line with Banting's meal plan ('three or four ounces of meat or fish') and this is paired with a 'glass or two' of sherry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The YouTuber said he likes the light protein before bed but the alcohol leaves him feeling a little light headed, as it did so earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before bed, Banting recommended a 'tumbler of grog (gin, whiskey, or brandy, without sugar) or a glass or two of claret or sherry.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson opted to have a glass of gin, which made him feel even more woozy. He said: '[Banting] may have lost waist size, but man, that liver. So he says that this [alcohol] attributes to the perfect night's sleep. I mean, yeah, probably because I'm going to be unconscious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol creates an illusion of restful sleep by initially acting as a sedative, but it disrupts the natural sleep cycle, leading to less REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep and more light sleep, causing fragmented rest and frequent awakenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day and alcohol aside, the YouTuber said he can see why the Banting diet can be effective when it comes to shedding weight as it is very low carb and it is less than the recommended calorie intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Other than the alcohol, I will say it's actually kind of debatable that this diet is better than a lot of current diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[This is] because there's just a lot of single ingredient foods. No additives, no chemicals, just the food for what it is, which we need more of in today's day and age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tennyson makes a lunch with cod, Brussel sprouts, and a piece of dry toast. For dessert, he interprets 'fruit out of a pudding' as a dish made with strawberries and whipped cream and as a drink, he opts for sherry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, while there's a lot of things that we should stay away from today, there's a lot of things that we should probably bring back and adopt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson used a food tracking app while on the Banting diet and in one day, it came out to &lt;span&gt;1,714 calories, 115g of protein, 31g of fat, &lt;/span&gt;and 68g of carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, the recommended calorie intake per day is 2,500 calories and when it comes to macronutrients, the USDA recommends consuming 10 percent to 35 percent of calories from protein, 45 percent to 65 percent from carbohydrates, and 20 percent to 35 percent from fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tennyson said that the Banting diet is so low in carbs, 'most people are going to lose &lt;span&gt;some weight.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York-based nutritionist Laura Cipullo told DailyMail.com that the Banting diet is a precursor to today's keto diet, which involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-5919c3d0-7eb0-11f0-8976-bb5db4900e1d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15019255/banting-diet-weight-loss-low-carb.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;THE BANTING DIET &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For dinner, five or six ounces of any fish except salmon, any meat except pork, any vegetable except potato, one ounce of dry toast, fruit out of a pudding, any kind of poultry or game, and two or three glasses of good claret, sherry, or Madeira—champagne, port and beer forbidden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For tea, two or three ounces of fruit, a rusk or two, and a cup of tea without milk or sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For supper, three or four ounces of meat or fish, similar to dinner, with a glass or two of claret.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;For nightcap, if required, a tumbler of grog—(gin, whiskey, or brandy, without sugar)—or a glass or two of claret or sherry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She says: '&lt;/span&gt;The Banting or keto diet macronutrient distribution typically ranges from approximately 55 percent to 60 percent fat, 30 percent to 35 percent protein, and five percent to 10 percent carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While you will dehydrate and lose all water related to glycogen stores immediately, you will then start to utilize fat and protein for energy. The goal is to use fat as the primary source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One should exercise when attempting a low-carb diet to preserve muscle mass and hypertrophy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, personal trainer and fitness expert Natalya &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://trainer-nyc.com/"&gt;Alexeyenko&lt;/a&gt; says she is not a fan of such restrictive approaches to dieting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because from her observations, she believes strict approaches usually bring 'only temporary results, and eventually, most people end up rebounding'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her preferred approach, she says: 'What works much better long-term is having a clear understanding of how to manage your calories, protein, fats, and carbs according to your current goals without feeling like you have to cut things out completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Carbs in particular, play an important role in building and maintaining muscle. With diets that cut them too low, someone might see the number on the scale go down, but in reality they’re often losing muscle instead of fat leading to that “skinny fat” look or simply not having a toned body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at the future of dieting, the personal trainer thinks there will be 'less focus on rigid plans and more emphasis on personalized nutrition plans built around someone’s lifestyle, preferences, and health needs, instead of strict rules that are hard to follow long-term'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 23:18:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOSTJ3Xzg5RFQ3cElLUEJDcmVGRlVmLUpSZkU1cVE2NmtzTk9ldER4SXNGVW1mOHZ1djJBUFJtZWRfS0ZZR0w3UWlCNm5mWkdZY083aGNVQVc1cldrSms0ZEpRcVIzX3VzNk9nazcxUUxna1A2R3lNdUktRVB4SDZSbkJDLS1lc29SaGNoOFZ3RnVFWjZa0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBaanFUd1VPX3RtZFdEZ3hhSTBNaFpXTGhhX0tSRExKclkzbWtDVnhTdUxPXzRINkRUdy1YaDltSmMyVFRERldrb21Hb3UwV1ZQdXV3RjVuZTY4Rk5MWEg1QzJwUkFnQzkwTXI1dmVGWk5SREFVR1lweEdGOV9RdFdzeGdOYlFSa3NWSVVhYVVQcTBLWjh3aGR0S0E</guid></item><item><title>使人们对病毒免疫的罕见突变- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/the-rare-mutation-that-makes-people-immune-to-viruses/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people carry a rare mutation that makes them resistant to viruses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now scientists have copied that effect with an experimental mRNA therapy that stopped both flu and COVID in animal trials — raising hopes for a universal antiviral.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Rare Mutation Unlocks Viral Immunity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For only a few dozen people worldwide, living with a rare immune disorder comes with an unexpected advantage: the ability to resist every &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;virus&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that can replicate only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Structurally, viruses consist of genetic material—either DNA or RNA—enclosed in a protective protein coat called a capsid, and sometimes a lipid envelope. They are uniquely distinguished by their simple, acellular organization and mode of reproduction, which involves hijacking the host cell&amp;amp;#039;s machinery to produce new virus particles. This process often results in disease in the host organism. Viruses are responsible for a wide range of diseases, including the common cold, influenza, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19. Despite their pathogenic nature, viruses also play roles in ecological and evolutionary processes, influencing gene transfer and genetic diversity.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt; that comes their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 years ago, Columbia immunologist Dusan Bogunovic first uncovered this remarkable protection shortly after identifying the genetic mutation behind the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the disorder appeared to simply make people more susceptible to certain bacterial infections. But as more cases were studied, a surprising benefit became clear. Bogunovic, now a professor of pediatric immunology at &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Columbia University&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Columbia University is an Ivy League institution based in New York City, recognized for its excellence in medicine, law, and scientific research.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/span&gt;’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, found that everyone with the mutation, which leads to a shortage of an immune regulator known as ISG15, experiences mild but persistent whole-body inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hidden Antiviral Clues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The type of inflammation they had was antiviral, and that’s when it dawned on me that these individuals could be hiding something,” Bogunovic recalls. When he and his colleagues looked at the individuals’ immune cells, they could see encounters with all sorts of viruses—flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox. But the patients had never reported any overt signs of infection or illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any virus,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after years of research, he is developing a potential therapy that could replicate this unusual form of protection and serve as a powerful safeguard in the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough Experiment Shows Promise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his latest study, published on August 13 in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Bogunovic and his team report that an experimental therapy they’ve developed temporarily gives recipients (hamsters and mice, so far) the same antiviral superpower as people with ISG15 deficiency. When administered prophylactically into the animals’ lungs via a nasal drip, the therapy prevented viral replication of influenza and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and has infected hundreds of millions worldwide. The virus has undergone multiple mutations, resulting in variants with differing transmission and immune escape characteristics.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/span&gt; viruses and lessened disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cell culture, “we have yet to find a virus that can break through the therapy’s defenses,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Therapy Works&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogunovic’s therapy is designed to mimic what happens in people with ISG15 deficiency, but only for a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of turning off ISG15 directly—which leads to the production of more than 60 proteins—Bogunovic’s therapeutic turns on the production of 10 proteins that are primarily responsible for the broad antiviral protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current design resembles COVID mRNA vaccines but with a twist: Ten mRNAs encoding the 10 proteins are packaged inside a lipid nanoparticle. Once the nanoparticles are absorbed by the recipient’s cells, the cells generate the ten host proteins to produce the antiviral protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We only generate a small amount of these ten proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals,” Bogunovic says. “But that inflammation is enough to prevent antiviral diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Next-Gen Pandemic Preparedness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogunovic’s team views their technology as a weapon against the next pandemic, providing protection for first responders, individuals in nursing homes, and family members of infected individuals, regardless of the responsible virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe the technology will work even if we don’t know the identity of the virus,” Bogunovic says. Importantly, the antiviral protection provided by the technology will not prevent people from developing their own immunological memory to the virus for longer-term protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the technology’s drug delivery and absorption properties still need optimization. When delivered to animals via nanoparticles, the 10 proteins were produced in the lungs, “but probably not at high enough levels that makes us comfortable going into people immediately,” Bogunovic says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fine-Tuning for Human Use&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;acid&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;An acid is a chemical substance that releases hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water, resulting in a low pH (below 7). Acids are often characterized by their sour taste and their ability to react with bases to form salts and water. They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;RNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is a single-stranded molecule involved in coding, decoding, and regulating gene expression. It acts as a messenger between DNA and protein synthesis and plays crucial roles in both genetic function and viral replication. Variants like mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA support different stages of protein assembly.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;, into the part of the body you want to protect is currently the biggest challenge in the field.” The researchers also need to determine how long the therapy’s antiviral protection will last, currently estimated at three to four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reinforce the power of research driven by curiosity without preconceived notions,” Bogunovic says. “We were not looking for an antiviral when we began studying our rare patients, but the studies have inspired the potential development of a universal antiviral for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

With the evolving research and pseudo-science influencers sharing misinformation online, it’s challenging to determine what, if anything, aside from water, can be consumed in a meal plan when weight loss is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, thinking in absolutes can really derail your goals, especially if you’re someone who enjoys a cup of juice with breakfast or milk in their cereal. Here at&lt;em&gt; EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all foods—drinks included—can fit into a healthy, balanced diet. Here are five “bad” drinks that are fine to consume, whether you want to lose weight or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cow’s Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the headlines that have deemed milk as “bad” for weight loss, demonizing its (natural) sugar content as the culprit, research has found the opposite to be true. For example, one study suggests that drinking whole milk is associated with lower body weight, BMI and risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Milk has a lot of benefits. The high-quality, bioavailable protein in milk, like leucine, stimulates muscle growth, which can optimize maintaining lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://sarahkoszyk.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Koszyk, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Koszyk, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “When people are trying to lose weight, they want to focus on preserving and maintaining their lean muscle mass and, instead, burn the fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a quick protein fix, milk offers just that. A 1-cup serving of skim milk delivers 8 grams of protein for just 90 calories. Whether you enjoy it on its own for a quick and nutrient-rich snack, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein shake with fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein shake with fruit&lt;/a&gt; for an on-the-go meal, or in a bowl of cereal, there’s no shame in adding dairy milk into your meal plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fortified Soy Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy foods, including soy milk, are a great addition to your weight-loss eating plan. One review found that studies suggest that eating plenty of protein can aid in weight loss, and this includes soy protein. The point being: Soy protein does not stand in the way of weight loss—and may even help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy milk can also help you consume a healthier diet. “Including soy milk in your diet is a fabulous way to up your protein, fiber and vitamin and mineral intake to meet your nutrient needs while losing weight,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reference, a 1-cup serving of fortified, unsweetened soy milk contains 7 grams of protein and 80 calories. Plus, it also packs vitamin B12, a nutrient often lacking in plant-based diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Naturally Sweetened Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored coffee tends to get a bad rap. Even when the benefits of caffeine are highlighted for weight loss, the second a sweetener enters the picture, coffee gets canceled. But, that doesn't have to be the case. “There are some coffee creamers that are high in ‘empty’ calories from sugars and saturated fats,” says Koszyk. “Coffee isn’t meant to be a high-caloric drink, but drinking black coffee doesn’t always appeal to everyone’s taste buds. Choosing the right coffee creamer that is low in sugar and saturated fat can offer satisfaction while still aligning with one’s weight-loss goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it's important to consider what will satisfy your taste buds while fitting into your weight-loss goals. That’s where naturally derived sweeteners, like monk fruit, or no-added-sugar coffee creamers come into play, says Koszyk. Or drizzle a little honey or maple syrup into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:your coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;your coffee&lt;/a&gt; for a truly natural sweet addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;100% Pomegranate Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A juice made from 100% fruit juice, like 100% pomegranate juice, can be a wonderful way to add flavor and nutrients to plain water. “Sometimes we need a little extra incentive to increase our water intake,” says Harris-Pincus. You can add a splash of the sweet and slightly tart juice to water or seltzer to encourage drinking more H20 without added sugar, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882893/health-benefits-of-pomegranates/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pomegranate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pomegranate&lt;/a&gt; consumption has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing body weight, blood pressure, blood sugar and other markers of cardiovascular health. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, good-for-you antioxidant compounds that help rid your body of free radicals and help decrease inflammation. For a nice twist on iced tea, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249903/hibiscus-pomegranate-iced-tea/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hibiscus-Pomegranate Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Low-Calorie, Lower-Sugar Sodas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diet soda is a love-it or hate-it item for many,” says Harris-Pincus. However, switching from full-sugar soda to zero-calorie soda can significantly decrease the number of calories you consume in a day and assist with weight loss, she says. While it is probably safe in moderation, the downside is that diet soda doesn’t contain anything beneficial for your health, adds Harris-Pincus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest first &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290448/is-drinking-soda-bad-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to diet soda;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to diet soda&lt;/a&gt; if you typically drink regular, then, over time, phase soda out completely (other than on occasion). Swapping soda for sparkling water and infusing it with fruit and herbs, like we do with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;, can help you make the switch less painfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Can Drinks Help with Weight Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well-hydrated may help keep your hunger at bay, while also simultaneously reducing the tendency to mindlessly munch. “Hydration is important because it helps us feel full and can reduce our hunger levels,” says Koszyk. Sometimes we think we are hungry, but in reality, we’re thirsty and dehydrated. “A refreshing drink can fill up the stomach while also sending a signal to the brain that you are full,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, when you provide your body with the right kind of fluids, you’ll also keep your gastrointestinal tract moving. And good digestive health is something that can lead to successful weight maintenance in the long term. Of course, most drinks beyond water contain calories, which does matter for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid calorie-containing drinks—even when you’re aiming to lose weight. “The right drinks can minimize hunger and increase satiety. Focus on staying hydrated with drinks that work with your needs so you enjoy life while reaching your goals,” says Koszyk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Know If a Drink Is Good for Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love a beverage not listed in the five above? Don’t worry! Here are a few tips Koszyk and Harris-Pincus use to evaluate if a drink can fit within someone’s weight-loss goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calorie content. &lt;/strong&gt;Be mindful of how many calories the drink provides. Ideally, avoid drinking calories that are worth more than a regular meal. Make sure that a meal-substitute drink has a protein or fiber source so you feel full and satisfied after drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the added sugar content. &lt;/strong&gt;Added sugars come from sweet ingredients like honey, agave, syrups and sugar, and they add calories but don’t fill us up. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 24 grams (6 teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate the total nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;Does the drink have more calories than you’d typically enjoy, but offer nutrients, like dietary fiber, protein and calcium? Then it may be a worthwhile addition to your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you may have heard, you don’t have to just rely on water for your fluid intake if you’re on a weight-loss plan. You can include drinks, like cow’s milk, soy milk, 100% pomegranate juice and others you like. “Any weight-loss plan should be sustainable in the long term. It’s important to include foods and beverages that are enjoyable while allowing you to remain in a caloric deficit,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, nutrition and your individual needs are unique. Working with a registered dietitian one-on-one is the best way to tailor a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8695433" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes the drinks you love that work with your weight-loss goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-drinks-you-shouldnt-avoid-for-weight-loss-11796212" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 20:09:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1aMUhIeEFwUzZpandxZjMxWlFicGZWZmN0TFd2b2tKdExXZ1ZIZXpabFY3TVdHaDFLTDFINFB4QnNhZjlaRktxUFJnYWJpR2JQaE1mVy1fT2VnendkM2ZFaGJJNE1LNGxwSkFWeE1KNA</guid></item><item><title>超过40万人的研究将肠道细菌与失眠风险联系起来- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-over-400000-people-links-gut-bacteria-with-insomnia-risk</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're learning more and more about how parts of our bodies are linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-remarkable-connection-discovered-between-our-heart-and-brain"&gt;and working together&lt;/a&gt; – and now a new study reveals connections between gut bacteria and the risk of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, from scientists in China and the US, suggests that being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cognitive-shuffling-really-could-help-insomniacs-get-to-sleep"&gt;unable to sleep at night&lt;/a&gt; could be at least partly down to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;mix of microbes&lt;/a&gt; in our digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the relationship appears to go both ways: poor sleep can disrupt the gut's microbial balance, creating a feedback loop that could make insomnia harder to shake. With further investigation, we may be able to develop treatments based on these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/screen-time-in-bed-may-increase-insomnia-odds-study-suggests"&gt;Screen Time In Bed May Increase Insomnia Odds, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota are commonly noted in patients with insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, their causal connections to insomnia phenotypes are far from being clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by psychiatrist Shangyun Shi of Nanjing Medical University, used a statistical approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt;. This method looks at genetic variations – which are set at birth and unaffected by lifestyle and other factors – to help determine whether one factor is truly influencing another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing genetic and health data from more than 400,000 people, the researchers found several clear matches. Certain types of bacteria were associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-linked-to-ultra-processed-foods-study-finds"&gt;increased insomnia risk&lt;/a&gt;, while others seemed to lower the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest evidence pointed to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridium_innocuum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium innocuum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; group of bacteria being linked to a greater risk of insomnia. It's not normally a dangerous kind of bacteria, but it appears to be contributing to sleepless nights for some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We identified a total of 14 and 8 bacterial taxa, respectively, as positively and negatively correlated with insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers. "In addition, there were reverse effects of insomnia correlated with 19 identified microbial taxa."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171453" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171453" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria.jpg" alt="Insomnia and bacteria" class="wp-image-171453 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria-477x415.jpg 477w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/InsomniaBacteria-600x522.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171453" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team found signs of gut bacteria affecting insomnia, as well as insomnia affecting gut bacteria. (Shi et al., &lt;em&gt;Gen. Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already know the gut-brain axis works in two directions, and previous research has linked it to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-lower-your-stress-it-may-just-take-4-weeks-of-eating-these-kinds-of-food"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-gut-bacteria-link-suggests-an-unexpected-simple-treatment"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-identifies-gut-microbe-imbalances-that-predict-autism-and-adhd"&gt;conditions such as autism and ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this study think that some of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fasting-style-diet-seems-to-result-in-dynamic-changes-in-human-brains"&gt;the chemical reactions&lt;/a&gt; that certain bacteria start or stop might explain the new findings. We're still at the early stages here, and further studies are going to be required in diverse populations – all the participants in this study were of European descent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that gut microbes are only one piece of the insomnia puzzle. Other factors can contribute, from stress at work to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-and-insomnia-often-go-together-and-this-could-be-why"&gt;drinking habits&lt;/a&gt;. But it appears that gut bacteria are definitely a factor to look at in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, &lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/health-and-lifestyle/prebiotics-probiotics/"&gt;prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could be developed to take advantage of this link, and poop transplants might also work as a way of treating insomnia – something that's being looked at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/transplanting-feces-from-one-person-to-another-could-ease-parkinsons-symptoms"&gt;for multiple conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the intertwined effects of insomnia on gut microbiota and vice versa represent a complex bidirectional relationship involving immune regulation, inflammatory response, release of neurotransmitters, and other molecular and cellular pathways," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2024-101855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowing what to eat and drink when trying to lose weight can be confusing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinks that you might think are "off-limits" can absolutely fit into a weight loss plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy milk, soy milk and 100% pomegranate juice are a few drinks that can fit into your plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Figuring out the best beverages for weight loss can be exhausting. With the evolving research and pseudo-science influencers sharing misinformation online, it’s challenging to determine what, if anything, aside from water, can be consumed in a meal plan when weight loss is the goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, thinking in absolutes can really derail your goals, especially if you’re someone who enjoys a cup of juice with breakfast or milk in their cereal. Here at&lt;em&gt; EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we believe all foods—drinks included—can fit into a healthy, balanced diet. Here are five “bad” drinks that are fine to consume, whether you want to lose weight or not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the headlines that have deemed milk as “bad” for weight loss, demonizing its (natural) sugar content as the culprit, research has found the opposite to be true. For example, one study suggests that drinking whole milk is associated with lower body weight, BMI and risk of obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Milk has a lot of benefits. The high-quality, bioavailable protein in milk, like leucine, stimulates muscle growth, which can optimize maintaining lean muscle mass,” says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://sarahkoszyk.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Koszyk, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “When people are trying to lose weight, they want to focus on preserving and maintaining their lean muscle mass and, instead, burn the fat."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a quick protein fix, milk offers just that.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy foods, including soy milk, are a great addition to your weight-loss eating plan. One review found that studies suggest that eating plenty of protein can aid in weight loss, and this includes soy protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The point being: Soy protein does not stand in the way of weight loss—and may even help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Soy milk can also help you consume a healthier diet. “Including soy milk in your diet is a fabulous way to up your protein, fiber and vitamin and mineral intake to meet your nutrient needs while losing weight,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For reference, a 1-cup serving of fortified, unsweetened soy milk contains 7 grams of protein and 80 calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, it also packs vitamin B12, a nutrient often lacking in plant-based diets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flavored coffee tends to get a bad rap. Even when the benefits of caffeine are highlighted for weight loss, the second a sweetener enters the picture, coffee gets canceled.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But, that doesn't have to be the case. “There are some coffee creamers that are high in ‘empty’ calories from sugars and saturated fats,” says Koszyk. “Coffee isn’t meant to be a high-caloric drink, but drinking black coffee doesn’t always appeal to everyone’s taste buds. Choosing the right coffee creamer that is low in sugar and saturated fat can offer satisfaction while still aligning with one’s weight-loss goals.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With this in mind, it's important to consider what will satisfy your taste buds while fitting into your weight-loss goals. That’s where naturally derived sweeteners, like monk fruit, or no-added-sugar coffee creamers come into play, says Koszyk. Or drizzle a little honey or maple syrup into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your coffee&lt;/a&gt; for a truly natural sweet addition.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A juice made from 100% fruit juice, like 100% pomegranate juice, can be a wonderful way to add flavor and nutrients to plain water. “Sometimes we need a little extra incentive to increase our water intake,” says Harris-Pincus. You can add a splash of the sweet and slightly tart juice to water or seltzer to encourage drinking more H20 without added sugar, she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Diet soda is a love-it or hate-it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;item for many,” says Harris-Pincus. However, switching from full-sugar soda to zero-calorie soda can significantly decrease the number of calories you consume in a day and assist with weight loss, she says. While it is probably safe in moderation, the downside is that diet soda doesn’t contain anything beneficial for your health, adds Harris-Pincus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Swapping soda for sparkling water and infusing it with fruit and herbs, like we do with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;, can help you make the switch less painfully.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying well-hydrated may help keep your hunger at bay, while also simultaneously reducing the tendency to mindlessly munch. “Hydration is important because it helps us feel full and can reduce our hunger levels,” says Koszyk. Sometimes we think we are hungry, but in reality, we’re thirsty and dehydrated. “A refreshing drink can fill up the stomach while also sending a signal to the brain that you are full,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, when you provide your body with the right kind of fluids, you’ll also keep your gastrointestinal tract moving. And good digestive health is something that can lead to successful weight maintenance in the long term.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Of course, most drinks beyond water contain calories, which does matter for weight loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, that doesn’t mean you have to avoid calorie-containing drinks—even when you’re aiming to lose weight. “The right drinks can minimize hunger and increase satiety. Focus on staying hydrated with drinks that work with your needs so you enjoy life while reaching your goals,” says Koszyk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Love a beverage not listed in the five above? Don’t worry! Here are a few tips Koszyk and Harris-Pincus use to evaluate if a drink can fit within someone’s weight-loss goals:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the calorie content. &lt;/strong&gt;Be mindful of how many calories the drink provides. Ideally, avoid drinking calories that are worth more than a regular meal. Make sure that a meal-substitute drink has a protein or fiber source so you feel full and satisfied after drinking it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the added sugar content. &lt;/strong&gt;Added sugars come from sweet ingredients like honey, agave, syrups and sugar, and they add calories but don’t fill us up. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily added sugar intake to 24 grams (6 teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (9 teaspoons) for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate the total nutrition. &lt;/strong&gt;Does the drink have more calories than you’d typically enjoy, but offer nutrients, like dietary fiber, protein and calcium? Then it may be a worthwhile addition to your day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Contrary to what you may have heard, you don’t have to just rely on water for your fluid intake if you’re on a weight-loss plan. You can include drinks, like cow’s milk, soy milk, 100% pomegranate juice and others you like. “Any weight-loss plan should be sustainable in the long term. It’s important to include foods and beverages that are enjoyable while allowing you to remain in a caloric deficit,” says Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, nutrition and your individual needs are unique. Working with a registered dietitian one-on-one is the best way to tailor a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8695433" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes the drinks you love that work with your weight-loss goals.

It’s easy to blame lack of discipline, too much screen time, or even dull lessons. But often, the missing piece is simpler: food. The brain is the hungriest organ in the body, using up to 20% of a child’s energy. During the school years, when the brain is rapidly forming connections for memory, reasoning, and focus, the fuel it receives can make all the difference. The good news? Brain-friendly foods don’t need to be exotic or expensive. Most are everyday staples that, with a little creativity, can slip easily into meals. Here are six foods every child should eat more often and smart ways to serve them without a battle at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，进化不是随机的，可以预测： “无非是革命性的” - Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/discovery-evolution-not-random-can-be-predicted-pangenome-genetic-history/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the story of evolution has centered on chance – mutations arrive without a plan, and natural selection keeps the winners. That view isn’t wrong, but it’s incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study shows that parts of evolution look orderly. Not every genetic outcome is a coin toss. Some genes tend to show up together while others stay separate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those tendencies add structure to how genomes change over time, making evolution predictable to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deciphering-the-pangenome"&gt;Deciphering the pangenome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial species carry two kinds of genes: a core set shared by all members and an accessory set that changes from strain to strain. The full collection is called a pangenome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessory genes matter because bacteria can exchange them through horizontal gene transfer. That process spreads useful traits quickly, including resistance to antibiotics, new ways to use nutrients, and tools to handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Professor James McInerney and Dr. Alan Beavan from the School of Life Sciences at the &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. Maria Rosa Domingo-Sananes from &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nottingham Trent University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications of this research are nothing short of revolutionary,” enthused Professor McInerney, the lead author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By demonstrating that evolution is not as random as we once thought, we’ve opened the door to an array of possibilities in synthetic biology, medicine, and environmental science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-using-ai-to-make-gene-predictions"&gt;Using AI to make gene predictions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compiled thousands of E. coli genomes and recorded which accessory genes each strain carries. They turned this into a large presence-absence matrix, with rows for strains and columns for genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They trained a machine-learning method called a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/random-forest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;random forest&lt;/a&gt; to predict whether a gene is present based on the rest of a genome’s accessory gene profile. They trained and tested the model many times to guard against chance splits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model succeeded for a substantial portion of the accessory genome. It could reliably predict the presence or absence of many genes based on the broader gene pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some genes tend to co-occur, likely because they work on connected steps of the same task. Others seldom appear together, often because they overlap in function or interfere with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that some gene families never turned up in a genome when a particular other gene family was already there, and on other occasions, some genes were very much dependent on a different gene family being present,” explained Dr. Domingo-Sananes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gene-interactions-and-evolution"&gt;Gene interactions and evolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not claim that every gene is predictable. Many accessory genes still look erratic, either because local history matters or because there isn’t yet enough data to capture their rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A correct forecast does not imply fate. It points to structure – constraints and tendencies – inside which change still happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns held across different parts of the species’ family tree, supporting the idea that selection and gene-gene interactions – not just shared ancestry – shape these outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These interactions between genes make aspects of evolution somewhat predictable, and furthermore, we now have a tool that allows us to make those predictions,” added Dr. Domingo-Sananes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolution-genes-and-healthcare"&gt;Evolution, genes, and healthcare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health teams track antibiotic resistance genes to stay ahead of infections. If certain accessory genes tend to accompany a resistance gene, tests can scan for that supporting set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach can flag trouble earlier, because partner genes may appear before the main gene becomes common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/applied-microbiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;applied microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, teams build strains that make medicines, recycle waste, or capture pollutants. Knowing which gene combinations tend to work well together – and which combinations tend to clash – saves time and money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From this work, we can begin to explore which genes ‘support’ an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/climate-change-is-fueling-antibiotic-resistance-in-our-soils/"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; gene, for example. If we are trying to eliminate antibiotic resistance, we can target not just the focal gene but also its supporting genes,” Dr. Beaven concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach can help synthesize new genetic constructs that may lead to new drugs or vaccines. Knowing what we now know has opened the door to many other discoveries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-read-results"&gt;How to read results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across many genomes, some genes keep showing up together. That’s co-occurrence, and it usually means the genes work on the same job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other pairs almost never share a genome. That’s mutual exclusion. They likely clash or do duplicate work. These patterns leave a fingerprint across the whole pangenome, and a computer model can learn that fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods matter. Scientists group related genes into families and adjust for how closely strains are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also test distant branches of the E. coli family tree. When the patterns still hold, it points to selection and real gene interactions – not just inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-evolution-and-future-studies"&gt;Genes, evolution, and future studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practical tools can build on this framework. Diagnostic panels can add partner genes that often travel with targets of concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance can watch for early warning signs in hospital isolates and wastewater. Engineering teams can map friendly and unfriendly gene pairings before they build strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader takeaway remains consistent. In bacteria, a significant slice of the accessory genome behaves in patterned ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those patterns reflect how genes interact and how selection keeps useful partnerships while avoiding costly overlaps. Evolution still surprises, but it also leaves tracks that careful analysis can read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304934120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:48:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNRTZoRUhicU9Gd2xpOC1QV1R5MDhhNVlWR0hiVlljYkpjbmtYVGxIcHBZclBTX3JsbGZhN2R2bkJvdnlOXzNMXzJpUEZBUEZzWm85SjdfeGEtazVlNHFZZ2RybS0yYmh3VjJjdHI0N0lxTVRRUXd6OF93ZmNHeG4tWE13UGdndWpKaXk1MklFdHVoU1dUZWtDQUYyalB3VFQzT2hZ</guid></item><item><title>定义他的破折号：当地人的遗产，他太谦虚了，看不到- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51364706/the-dash-that-defined-him-local-mans-legacy-that-he-was-too-humble-to-see</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLACKFOOT, Idaho – When Scott Hancock died of cancer in May, his wife Colleen knew his story was much more than a date of birth and a date of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Scott had written his own obituary, it would have been simple: Born November 18, 1946 – Died May 18, 2025," said Colleen. "I asked him, 'What about the dash?' His real story lies in the dash between those two dates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Hancock never believed he made much of a difference in his life. However, now that he's gone, his wife has made it her mission to let people know that he did make a difference. A huge one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in Pocatello in the 1950s. At age 4, he went to bed one night a perfectly healthy, happy little boy. The next morning, he woke up unable to walk. His parents rushed him to St. Anthony Hospital, where doctors, fresh from training at a polio clinic back east, recognized the signs immediately. The polio virus had attacked the nerves in his legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was sent to the Elks Rehabilitation Center for Polio in Boise, where he was fitted with leg braces to help support his weight and returned home. Despite this drastic and unexpected life change, his parents refused to treat him differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was the youngest of five children," Colleen Hancock said. "He was expected to do his chores just like his brothers and sister, behave appropriately, and not complain. He believed that made him the man he became — a regular person who just happened to have a disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He learned to live resourcefully at a young age. As a little boy, he sold worms, dug for Island Park fishermen, shined his brother's shoes for a nickel, and fixed roller skates for neighborhood kids — all to buy small gifts for his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, Pocatello schools weren't sure how to accommodate students with disabilities, and some people feared they might catch polio by touching someone who had survived it. His mother fought for her son's right to an education. She eventually helped establish the Handicapped School at Idaho State University for Scott and many other students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to public school in seventh grade, using his crutches and a wheelchair to get around. He went on to graduate from Highland High School's very first graduating class in 1964, later enrolling at Idaho State University as an art major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seeing Scott Hancock riding a motorcycle from his wheelchair was a sight that turned heads, but it was something that gave him much pleasure in life. (Photo: Family photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was only the beginning of his long list of accomplishments, according to Colleen Hancock. He helped write Idaho's Americans with Disabilities Act legislation and served on multiple state councils for people with disabilities. He directed a senior program in northern Idaho, traveling the state to set up meal services and secure financial help for seniors in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, he shifted gears into construction. For 34 years, he built and remodeled homes across northern Idaho doing much of the work crawling on the ground or from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He found a different way of solving problems. He kept a marble in his pocket while he was building houses. He put the marble on the floor to see if it rolled to determine if the floors were straight," said Colleen. "He never let being in a wheelchair stop him from doing the things he wanted to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made friends with kids who had fast cars, hitching rides until he could afford his own vehicle. When he finally bought one, he retrofitted it with hand controls and drove it hunting and fishing in Island Park and throughout southeast Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his greatest joys was riding his Honda Gold Wing motorcycle retrofitted so he could drive it from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wrote extensively, contributing to the Island Park News, Blackfoot Morning News and publishing in Idaho Magazine, American Motorcyclist and Sports Afield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet he often dismissed his work as insignificant. "There are so many others who do a much better job," he would say. "These are just silly little stories anyone could write."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Author and Island Park News columnist Scott Hancock at a book signing in Island Park with his friend and fellow author EC Stilson of Pocatello. (Photo: Family photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was asked many times to write a book about his life, but always said, "Nobody would believe I really did those things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Hancocks eventually returned to southeast Idaho, settling in Blackfoot, he reluctantly "retired." That's when he began writing the "little stories" about his life that grew into two volumes of "Tales from the High Lonesome." They were so well received that he began writing a third volume before his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colleen Hancock has since published Volume 3, now available on Amazon, fulfilling the promise she made to her husband to publish it. She plans to combine his remaining writings into a fourth book, creating one final large collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott's books are available through Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and at Kesler's Market in Blackfoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she emphasizes that writing was just a small part of his accomplishments and who he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He raised children who were not his own and loved them as if they were. He gave from his heart, made friends everywhere, and loved being with people," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Colleen Hancock, sharing his legacy is about honoring the impact he never fully saw in himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am not the writer. My husband was. His story is one of resilience. I can only try to express what I saw and learned from him and share some of his dash with you," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

But the brain often gives much quieter warnings, hidden in everyday life, long before those symptoms surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Dr. Bing, MD MPH, lists 5 signs that can be so ordinary that most of us ignore them until it’s too late.

Balance relies on the cerebellum and basal ganglia, areas also affected in dementia. A Japanese &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25523051/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that people who couldn’t balance well were more likely to have small-vessel disease in the brain and lower cognition. This doesn’t mean failing once predicts dementia, but if balance is consistently poor, it may reflect early neural decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Difficulty rising from a chair or squatting&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple “sit-to-stand” test, where you rise from a chair without using your hands, reflects lower body strength and mobility. Poor performance here has been linked to dementia risk. A UK Biobank &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667032122000361#:~:text=The%20five%2Dtimes%20chair%2Dstand%20test%20greater%20than%2010%20s,with%20advancing%20age%20%5B9%5D." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that slower chair-stand times were tied to a higher chance of future dementia. Experts note that weak legs may signal reduced blood flow and brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since physical strength and cognition share brain pathways, this decline can be an early warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acting out dreams at night&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequently kicking, shouting, or punching during sleep may suggest REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), where people act out their dreams. Normally, muscles stay paralyzed during REM sleep, but in RBD, this safety system fails due to early brainstem degeneration. Long-term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9363360/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that up to 80% of people with idiopathic RBD later develop Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies, often within 10–12 years. If symptoms are present, a sleep study is essential, as early diagnosis allows doctors to manage risks and improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Persistent feelings of loneliness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is more than just being alone—it reflects feeling socially disconnected. Studies show it is linked to higher dementia risk. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7424267/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;-analysis found lonely adults had a 40% higher risk of dementia. Brain scans reveal reduced grey matter in memory regions like the hippocampus, and loneliness is also associated with changes in BDNF, a protein crucial for brain health. Chronic loneliness triggers inflammation and stress pathways that speed up neural decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weak hand grip&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is an easy measure of overall health and frailty. Struggling to open jars or carry groceries can signal weakness that is linked to brain decline. A large &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2793510" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in JAMA Network Open found that lower grip strength was associated with smaller brain volumes and poorer cognitive performance. Weaker grip may relate to inflammation, reduced activity, and early frailty. The good news is strength can be improved—resistance training, protein-rich diets, and targeted hand exercises have been shown to boost grip and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 16:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>警告：致命的牛源性超级细菌正在传播给人类-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15026091/deadly-cattle-borne-superbug-spreading-humans.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A dangerous superbug commonly found in cattle can jump to humans, and researchers warn that infections may soon become untreatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team from Penn State University discovered that Salmonella Dublin has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics and is spreading to humans through contaminated beef, milk, or cheese, or through direct &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-15014833/Frankenstein-rabbit-outbreak-threat-humans.html"&gt;contact with infected cows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers studied 2,150 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14891037/FDA-issues-urgent-recall-cucumbers-contamination.html"&gt;Salmonella Dublin&lt;/a&gt; strains from cattle, humans, and the environment and found they were all genetically similar, making it easier for the bacteria to spread across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This bacterium typically causes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14816895/Urgent-recall-popular-cereal-contain-pieces-METAL.html"&gt;severe illness or death&lt;/a&gt; among cows, but it can also result in serious blood infections among people, especially those in close contact with farm animals. In severe cases, Salmonella Dublin can kill people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Making matters worse, the new study revealed that cattle strains have the highest levels of antibiotic resistance, particularly to drugs meant for treating infections, such as tetracycline and cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increasing antibiotic resistance means that infections may become harder to treat, potentially leading to longer illnesses or more severe symptoms for people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If treatments become less effective, human infections could become more dangerous, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, or those with weak immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study authors added that the US, being a major beef and dairy-producing country, is at an even greater risk of this superbug turning into a widespread health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cattle are the main carriers of a superbug called Salmonella Dublin, an antibiotic-resistant bacterium (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Penn State researchers (pictured) found that the bacteria was present in cows, people, and in both food and farm surfaces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used data from two public sources: the National Center for Biotechnology Information Pathogen Isolate Browser and the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These provided whole-genome sequences of Salmonella Dublin, which allowed the team to examine each strain's genes in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They compared 581 samples from cattle, 664 from humans, and 905 from the environment (food and farm areas) to identify patterns in how the bacteria's genes cause severe disease and resist antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria from cows, people, and the environment were incredibly similar, with 72 percent of the 2,150 strains differing by only a few DNA changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although cow strains had the most genes that were resistant to medication, those found contaminating food and surfaces had more DNA mutations linked to quinolone resistance, a drug used to treat humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the study published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00689-25"&gt;Applied and Environmental Microbiology&lt;/a&gt; warned that each strain examined had similar genes that make them dangerous, like those helping them stick to cells or invade the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These genes were present in almost every strain in cows, people, or food, meaning the bacteria are consistently harmful no matter where it's found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study leader Erika Ganda, an associate professor of food animal microbiomes, said in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/bacteria-strains-infecting-cattle-and-humans-us-are-highly-similar"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;: 'That's important, because it shows that Salmonella Dublin is highly connected across humans, animals and the environment — so efforts to control it need to consider all three.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Hormone therapy promises relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many women wonder about taking it. That’s because the treatment, subject of a recent expert panel convened by the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/fda-kennedy-antidepressants-hormones-meetings-experts-afbd525b29ca5e2585b79548a075be75"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, has long been shrouded in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once used routinely. But in 2002, research testing one type was stopped early because of concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and blood clots. Concerns lingered even though later studies showed the benefits of today’s hormone therapies outweigh the risks for many women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is still a lot of confusion and a lot of fear,” said Grayson Leverenz, a 50-year-old from Durham, North Carolina, who hesitated to take it but is glad she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others increasingly are also giving hormone therapy a second look. But experts continue to disagree about how to present the treatment’s pros and cons. The FDA-assembled panel stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions — prompting dozens of experts to call for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say hormone therapy is a great option for many, but not all, menopausal women — and it’s important to understand the nuanced reality of these treatments before deciding what’s best.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;How hormone therapy works &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It treats symptoms that can arise when menstruation winds down and ends, causing levels of estrogen and progesterone to drop very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Because it’s applied into the vagina, very little circulates in the blood and the risks are far lower. Doctors say it’s a good option for women whose biggest complaint is vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-body therapy includes pills, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms like hot flashes. Such systemic hormones include estrogens and progestogens.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zwink, a nurse in Castle Rock, Colorado, began using an estrogen patch more than a year ago and also has an IUD, which gives her progesterone. The treatment has relieved her hot flashes, improved her sleep and eased her joint pain and bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not like a 100% magic wand,” she said. “But it definitely has made a significant difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Menopause Society says hormone therapy can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease if started within 10 years of reaching menopause. It may also reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and maintain bone density for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might have a drop in their bone density at age 60" instead of at age 50, said Dr. MargEva Morris Cole, an OB-GYN with Duke University.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Hormone therapy carries some risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Leverenz was first prescribed hormone therapy last year, she kept worrying about the risks she’d heard about — then finally decided: “I can’t live like this anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a combination of three medications, her anxiety lifted, her sleep improved, her joint pain and hot flashes went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like myself again,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say many patients hesitate to try hormones, and they try to reassure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women can use estrogen therapy for seven years – and estrogen-progestogen therapy for three to five years – before breast cancer risk goes up, according to the Menopause Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group says both estrogen therapy and estrogen-progestogen therapy increase the risk of stroke, which goes away soon after stopping hormones. The risk of blood clots rises if you take hormones by mouth, but may be lower if you use a patch, gel or spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these risks are small,” said Dr. Nanette Santoro, an OB-GYN at the University of Colorado. “And they have to be weighed against the benefit of symptom relief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, medical history and how long women stay on the hormones are also considerations. Many women take them for around five years, and those who’ve had a stroke or certain other conditions may be advised against using them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Debate on changing warnings on hormone medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are divided over whether there should be changes in “black box” health warnings on some hormone treatments. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the physicians at the recent expert panel meeting convened by the FDA prescribe the hormones or are involved with a pharmaceutical industry campaign opposing the warning label. A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that “removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk,” and asked the agency to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, doctors urge people to be wary of misinformation, like false claims on social media posts that hormones will prevent dementia and ensure a healthy old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t say that you are going to live a longer, healthier life because you took hormones,” Duke’s Cole said. “I don’t want the pendulum to go so far that people feel that it is promising health for the next 30 to 40 years.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to hormone therapy for menopause &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro pointed to a new non-hormonal medication called fezolinetant, marketed as Veozah, for hot flashes and night sweats. The anti-epileptic medication gabapentin, in low doses, can also be used for hot flashes and a moisturizer can improve vaginal dryness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also say regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santoro urged against the “wild proliferation” of supplements claiming to be menopause cure-alls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody is in on the menopause gold rush,” she said. “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    &lt;p&gt;Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering," Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore," Fello said. "We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A "first-of-its-kind technology"  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/stroke-treatment-vivistim/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vivistim System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf21/P210007B.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;FDA-approved&lt;/a&gt; implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22279-vagus-nerve" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. They regulate the body's involuntary functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in "greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors," Nossek said in emailed remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use," Nossek said. "This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 108-person trial &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00475-X/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published in The Lancet in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have "moderate to severe deficits" qualify for the device, the company &lt;a href="https://microtransponder.showpad.com/share/D0VkrCHvDXiqoQf11CiVP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implant aids in recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked," Fello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with "less than 1% chance of any complications." Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't "something he could have done before." Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"The sky's the limit"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/robotic-coach-offer-new-hope-for-stroke-patients-on-the-road-to-recovery/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;other new technologies&lt;/a&gt; may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back," Bain said. "In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but &lt;a href="https://www.vivistim.com/find-a-provider/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;shared a map&lt;/a&gt; that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back," Covey said. "This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down." &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You might expect that with age comes a natural progression of brain degeneration, but new research shows that this might not be the case for all regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of mouse and human brains suggests that some parts of the somatosensory cortex – the part of the brain that processes sensory information – aren't just exempt from the thinning found in other parts, they actually grow stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result suggests that the brain's ability to adapt and change continues, even into older age – and that the more you use it, the stronger your brain could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Humans Age Faster at 2 Sharp Peaks – Here's When&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until now, it had not been considered that the primary somatosensory cortex consists of a stack of several extremely thin layers of tissue, each with its own architecture and function. We have now found that these layers age differently," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;explains neuroscientist Esther Kühn&lt;/a&gt; of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases and the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the cerebral cortex becomes thinner overall, some of its layers remain stable or, surprisingly, are even thicker with age. Presumably because they are particularly solicited and thus retain their functionality.

Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and requirements, reorganizing and rewiring its neural connections to support evolving needs. The assumption is that neuroplasticity peaks when you're young, and gradually declines with age; however, this assumption is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.101514"&gt;not necessarily supported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.09.004"&gt;robust evidence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by neuroscientists Peng Liu and Juliane Doehler of &lt;span&gt;Otto von Guericke University &lt;/span&gt;Magdeburg in Germany, a team of researchers undertook a study of possible age-related changes in the human cerebral cortex, a folded region of the brain that usually thins with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is generally assumed that less brain volume means reduced function," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;. "However, little is known about how exactly the cortex actually ages. This is remarkable, given that many of our daily activities depend on a functioning cortex. That's why we examined the situation with high-resolution brain scans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took particularly sensitive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="171348" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; brain scans of 61 adults between the ages of 21 and 80, focusing on a small region at the top of the brain called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex"&gt;primary somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which receives tactile sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this region is structured a little bit like a stack of crepes: multiple layers of extremely thin, delicate tissue, each with its own role. These layers, the brain scans revealed, present differently depending on a person's age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some are thinner in older people, as expected; but the middle and upper layers were found to be thicker in older people than the same layers seen in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The middle layer is effectively the gateway for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_perception"&gt;haptic&lt;/a&gt; [touch] stimuli. In the layers above, further processing occurs," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kühn. "For example, in the case of sensory stimuli from the hand, the upper layers are particularly involved in the interaction between neighboring fingers. This is important when grasping objects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower layers, by contrast, were thinner in the older patients. These are the layers that handle modulation, where tactile signals are amplified or suppressed, depending on context. For example, you don't tend to feel your clothing unless you're thinking about it – similar to the way &lt;a href="https://www.ceenta.com/news-blog/why-cant-i-see-my-nose"&gt;your brain edits out your nose&lt;/a&gt; from your field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to why different layers thicken or thin with age, the team suggests it could come down to the old adage of "use it or lose it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The middle and upper layers of the cortex are most directly exposed to external stimuli. They are permanently active because we have constant contact with our environment," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;. "The neural circuits in the lower layers are stimulated to a lesser extent, especially in later life. I therefore see our findings as an indication that the brain preserves what is used intensively. That's a feature of neuroplasticity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although the lower layers shrink, they may compensate for any cellular degeneration. Their myelin content was found to increase in response to an increase in a certain type of neuron that amplifies the modulation signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another sign of adaptability, and the researchers hope that, in future research, they may be able to find a way to promote these adaptive mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, our findings are consistent with the general idea that we can do something good for our brains with appropriate stimulation. I think it's an optimistic notion that we can influence our aging process to a certain degree," &lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/news/press-releases/press/the-cerebral-cortex-ages-less-than-thought"&gt;Kühn says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02013-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Since my husband’s mother found out, she has made it her personal mission to put a halt to the event.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmen5dsn9001r3b79sdr98tgt@published"&gt;She claims that we are “inviting disaster” by holding it and accepting gifts for our baby before he arrives. I have told her that if she is not comfortable attending, that’s fine, but she doesn’t get to decide for me. Her response has been to tell me to go ahead, but “don’t be surprised when the baby is stillborn.” I’ve had enough. She is really starting to cast a pall over what should be a happy occasion. My husband tells me she’s always been superstitious and to just ignore her. Easy for him to say—he’s not the one who’s pregnant! How can I convince him that he needs to get his mother to keep her opinions to herself?&lt;/p&gt;

Or, at any rate, I wouldn’t bother, because even if you convinced &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, he’d still have to convince her. (And if his response to you is that you ought to ignore her—presumably that’s what he does—I am pretty sure he knows he won’t be able to convince her. Not to mention that he doesn’t want to be bothered trying.)&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve already told her where you stand; she’s blown right by that &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; escalated things. Someone who tells you your baby is going to be stillborn is not someone you need to hear from. So stop speaking to her altogether until after the baby is born. I wouldn’t even make a production of it: I’d just say, “Oh, sorry, can’t talk now” whenever she calls—or not pick up the phone when you see it’s her. If she stops in for a visit, you’ll be just on your way out.&lt;/p&gt;

If she complains about your freeze-out to her son—and she will—that’s his chance to say something to her, which is what you wanted in the first place. If nothing else, he can explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re icing her out. That conversation will be good for both of them. Will it change her? Doubtful. But the most important outcome of this is that you won’t have to listen to the dreadful things she has to say anymore. And you can keep this strategy in your back pocket for after the baby is born, if she tries to get under your skin then too. You are under no obligation to put up with her (or anyone’s) bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

My very good friend, let’s call her Stacy, was married years ago, to a man whose niece had a daughter at 16. My friend and her husband stepped up and took care of the baby most days for 18 months, until the birth mother came to them and announced that she just couldn’t do it anymore. They ended up adopting the baby. A couple years later, the birth mom came to them with the fact that she was pregnant again. Stacy and her husband adopted this baby at birth. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/03/adoption-disclosure-teenagers-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;They raised both girls for the next two years before divorcing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For example, Wise recommends daily breathing exercises to “access the healing power of the parasympathetic ‘restorative’ state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Most of us spend most of our time in ‘fight-or-flight,’ which is when the body pumps out stress hormones that aren’t meant to be flooding us so consistently,” she said. “This perpetual state of hormonal stress erodes our sense of well-being and can put a kibosh on our sex drives, to boot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take five minutes once or twice a day to do this practice. First, find a quiet spot to sit and “give yourself permission to be exactly as you are and for the moment to be exactly as it is,” Wise said.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potassium absorption isn't significantly affected by when you eat a banana.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The body naturally balances potassium levels based on intake and current needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A varied, nutrient-rich diet is more important than banana timing for potassium benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bananas are a go-to snack for good reason: they’re convenient, tasty and packed with nutrients. There’s no denying that bananas are an excellent source of potassium. A medium-sized banana is loaded with around 420 mg of potassium, which is about 12 to 16 percent of your daily needs (2,600 mg for females and 3,400 mg for males).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is a mineral and electrolyte that plays some very important roles in supporting overall health. It helps keep your body hydrated, supports cell and nerve functioning and maintains healthy muscle and heart function, yet most Americans don’t get enough of it each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you’re aiming to get the biggest potassium benefit from your banana, does the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when you eat it actually matter? We asked registered dietitians to weigh in—and the answer might surprise you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truth be told, there is no single “best time” or “worst time” to eat a banana for maximum potassium intake. This is because timing doesn’t have much of an impact on potassium absorption, as opposed to other nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Our body absorbs potassium passively, like a sponge,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-han-mph-rdn-ld-3351911a5/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Diane Han, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Once it has absorbed enough or reached an optimal level, absorption becomes limited.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In other words, your body’s pretty good at figuring out what it needs, regardless of when you eat potassium-rich foods. When you eat a banana, your body will figure out what to do that’s best in the moment to maintain a nutritional equilibrium so you don’t experience any negative symptoms, like low blood pressure, dizziness or muscle aches,” says &lt;a href="https://tracynutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-influences-potassium-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Influences Potassium Absorption? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium is absorbed in the small intestine, and your body generally does a good job of using what you consume. But certain factors can affect potassium levels—like high sodium intake, some medications, vomiting or diarrhea and underlying health conditions that impact how your body retains or excretes potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think of potassium levels like a see-saw, Beckerman says. “If you are eating foods that are putting too much potassium into your body, excretion will be high, so levels remain stable,” she says. “If intake is too low, excretion will be low, so it is conserved in the body.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The kidneys do much of this balancing act. If your potassium stores are low, your body will hold on to the necessary amount of potassium when you eat potassium-rich foods. But if your potassium levels are appropriate, your body will excrete the excess through the urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The other nutrients you eat with bananas don't have much of an impact on potassium absorption. “Potassium acts alone as an electrolyte that does its own thing, regardless if it’s ingested with other macronutrients like proteins, fat and carbohydrates,” Beckerman says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-the-most-potassium-from-your-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get the Most Potassium from Your Bananas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of stressing over banana timing, focus on building a nutrient-rich eating pattern. “Eating a variety of whole plant foods supports a balanced diet that promotes heart and overall health, while also helping regulate healthy potassium levels in conjunction with other nutrients,” Han says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, bananas aren’t the only potassium heroes. Other potassium-rich foods to include are potatoes, Swiss chard and spinach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another tip: keep your sodium in check. Potassium and sodium work together in the body, so maintaining a healthy sodium level can help your body maintain the right balance between sodium and potassium in the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re aiming to get the best potassium benefit from eating bananas, the time you choose to eat one does not really matter. Potassium absorption tends to be efficient regardless of timing. Bananas can help support your body’s potassium needs, whether you eat them morning, evening, or mid-day. Rather than stressing over the perfect time to eat a banana for maximum potassium benefits, focus on getting enough potassium-rich foods in your diet.&lt;br&gt;

Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;, unfortunately, is everywhere—in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn’t pose a threat to humans. &lt;em&gt;Usually.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal places for Legionnaire’s to grow and spread. They’re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person’s lungs when they inhale.

Between long hours indoors, sunscreen use, pollution, and lifestyle shifts, vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most widespread nutritional gaps of our time.

              &lt;p&gt;What if you could fix your damaged eye without having to shoot a laser at it? Scientists have potentially discovered a novel method of repairing the cornea, similar to LASIK, that wouldn’t require a laser or other invasive surgical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Occidental College and the University of California, Irvine, created the technique, which aims to temporarily make the cornea malleable. In experiments with rabbit eyeballs, their method appeared to work while also leaving corneal cells alive. More research is needed to vet the procedure, but if all goes well, it could become a preferred alternative to LASIK, the researchers claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a long road between what we’ve done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible,” said lead researcher Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, in a &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/pressroom/presspacs/2025/august/an-alternative-to-lasik-without-the-lasers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Chemical Society.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Why some people avoid LASIK&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lasik-eye-surgery/about/pac-20384774"&gt;LASIK&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used to treat conditions like myopia, farsightedness, or astigmatism. It reshapes the cornea—the transparent, outer layer of the eye that captures and focuses light onto the retina—using a precise cutting laser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though generally safe and effective, the surgery does permanently weaken the structural integrity of the cornea. People will also commonly experience side effects like dry eye and visual disturbances like halos; a small few will even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8319231/"&gt;develop&lt;/a&gt; serious, if rare, complications like chronic nerve pain. Ideally, the team’s method would avoid these risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A potentially safer method&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technique is called electromechanical reshaping. Some of the authors had previously used it to manipulate other parts of the body that contain collagen and water, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5008912/"&gt;ears&lt;/a&gt;. It works by altering the pH of the tissue via short bursts of electricity, briefly allowing it to be molded as desired. Once the proper pH is restored, the tissue returns to its original rigid state.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers used the technique on rabbit eyeballs in the lab, some of which were intended to represent myopia in humans. Special contact lenses made from platinum were placed over the extracted eyes. These lenses served as an electrode, providing a base for how the cornea should be correctly reshaped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the researchers lightly zapped the eye, the cornea became flexible and contoured to the shape of the lens. Not only did the cornea fill out as the researchers wanted, but the procedure didn’t seem to kill any corneal cells or otherwise affect the cornea’s stability. A YouTube video describing the team’s approach, from the American Chemical Society, can be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbJWbUt0m0"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers admit that it will take more research in animals before they can even think about testing their method in humans. Their next planned step is to try out the procedure on living rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the potential for the team’s work is certainly there, and it may extend beyond treating myopia. The researchers are also hoping to explore whether electromechanical reshaping can help repair farsightedness, astigmatism, and possibly even some forms of cloudy vision.&lt;/p&gt;
