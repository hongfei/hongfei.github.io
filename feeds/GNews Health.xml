Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research reveals","elementId":"180f50ba-2a37-479b-b92f-cc3092c578b2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/18/artificial-intelligence-uk-emotional-support-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/18/warning-ai-chatbots-inaccurate-financial-advice-tips-chatgpt-copilot-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;gave inaccurate financial advice&lt;/a&gt;, while similar concerns have been raised about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5ggew08eyo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summaries of news stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Typing “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:17,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Google said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNQXBwR0FUdTRWaVBla050WU9xQW9YMDlERXdOc2hnZ0pLS2FBbjhmMmZaZ1ZKSTZNTUdMekc1ZmZWcExJaGRTVFctYm94dHlJZVNOOWJhOVdFcVdrVWx0RjZuSzhmeEdxbVRsRElfNDdMUERxVHNic293NVMyT1N2aDlRT09KMnY0NHkwODZlUzYwNjVtVDFtdlkyZ2JxWS1KMWwwRU1nTXRTNGk4a3dv</guid></item><item><title>视频： Golden Retriever Puppy在未能转身后反击- DogTime</title><link>https://dogtime.com/news/201001-golden-retriever-puppy-reverse-walk-video-funny</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early puppyhood is often filled with clumsy movements, curious discoveries, and moments that are unintentionally hilarious. For many pet parents, these fleeting stages pass quickly, making them worth capturing on camera whenever possible. One such moment recently caught the internet’s attention, thanks to a short but charming video of a Golden Retriever puppy figuring out how his body works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-shows-golden-retriever-puppy-walk-in-reverse-because-he-can-t-turn-around"&gt;Video shows Golden Retriever puppy walk in reverse because he can’t turn around&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent video shared by @adventures.of.pilot, a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy called Pilot is attempting to navigate his surroundings but ends up walking backward instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Onscreen text explains the situation: “Enjoy this video of my puppy walking in reverse because he didn’t know how to turn around.” The puppy takes hesitant, wobbly steps as he slowly backs up, appearing genuinely unsure of what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilot is also wearing a small harness, which some viewers speculated may have added to his confusion. Whether it was the harness or simply a case of puppy brain, the result was a hilarious and wholesome scene. As he carefully reverses, his movements are cautious but determined, as if he believes backing up is the only logical solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for the clip to gain traction. The video quickly racked up more than 310K likes and drew over a hundred comments from viewers who related to Pilot’s behavior or simply found it hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many shared stories of their own dogs going through similar phases, noting how common it is for puppies to struggle with basic movements as they learn coordination and spatial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One viewer jokingly wrote “beep beep beep,” comparing Pilot’s backward steps to a vehicle reversing. Another called him “a little goofball,” while someone else said their own puppy looked like he was “processing how to walk” during his early days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One popular comment summed up the playful tone by saying Golden Retrievers are “just orange cats in disguise,” joking that they all seem to share “one single brain cell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;UNC Health's Triangle-area hospitals will implement temporary visitor restrictions on Monday, Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The resetrictions include measures as:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors 11 years old and younger will be prohibited from all hospital inpatient areas and waiting areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors older than 11 with respiratory symptoms will be prohibited from inpatient areas and waiting areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All employees at designated inpatient locations will be required to wear a mask while providing care. Masks are not required, but strongly encouraged, for patients and visitors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Affected facilities include UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill and Hillsborough, UNC Health Rex in Raleigh and Holly Springs, UNC Health Chatham in Siler City, and UNC Health Johnston in Clayton and Smithfield. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The restrictions have been put in place in recent years during the cold weather months when respiratory illnesses increase. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The move comes as the state saw a significant jump in emergency room admissions from flu-like illnesses last week. Approximately 2,000 people had flu-like symptoms, according to &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard"&gt;data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 39 people have died from the flu so far this winter in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

Each participant provided information on their daily consumption of coffee, tea, and water, along with other lifestyle habits and their health history. The result: people who divided their daily fluid intake between several drinks—especially water, coffee, and tea—had a lower mortality risk than those who concentrated mainly on just one drink. The most favorable ratio of coffee to tea netted out at two cups of coffee for every three cups of tea—i.e., if you've already had one of each and still want another, grab a tea next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pattern that stood out particularly positively was when coffee and tea were consumed together. In moderate quantities, supplemented by sufficient water, this combination was most common among the participants with the best long-term health values. The decisive factor here was, above all, about balance: neither excessive coffee consumption nor drinking only water or tea scored best, but the mixture throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Which factors are really decisive in the combination of drinks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study emphasize that the results are based on observations. This means that they show correlations, but do not prove any direct causes. Nevertheless, the results fit in well with what we already know. While coffee and tea provide natural plant substances, water supports basic processes in the body. Together, they could ensure that the body is well hydrated and at the same time benefits from things like antioxidants in coffee and tea, which studies have linked to anti-inflammatory effects, better vascular function, and a more stable metabolism—all factors that are also relevant for life expectancy in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is particularly interesting to note is that drinking water alone was not automatically associated with the best results. Although drinking enough remains an important basis for good health, the analysis shows that water is particularly beneficial when it is part of a varied beverage pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5abDJpYVNWU2JvNEhtcnpNSDBrWEhVRmw1aHNtendHOWd0REJ5WU9lVHpuYlM2WTdCTjFlaC14UjFJUVpHSGJEQUNsbVctUWFVNTVfaUE2TEMteDdmN1diQmlpbGJINjFkNGItQjc1Zw</guid></item><item><title>我从没想过我妈妈会搬进退休社区。我现在意识到她可能隐藏了一个毁灭性的秘密。- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mom-dementia-retirement-community_n_691dfc87e4b06f2a60cb10ac</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, I find myself weeping in my bed when the night sky is at its blackest and my husband, Geoff, is dead asleep on his side, his silhouette a distant mountain range. I press my face into my damp pillow to mute the occasional, plaintive chirp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much of a crier, so these late-night keening sessions make no sense. I’m a 59-year-old, happily married woman, and my children are healthy and grown, yet when the lights go out and the world lies down, a single phrase repeats itself in my mind: &lt;em&gt;I want my mom. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother isn’t missing or gone. She lives a short 20-minute drive away in an assisted living facility. When I visit, she looks like herself, shorter than me, hair dyed brown and styled in pert curls, with a smile people say looks like mine. When she speaks, her word choices, her intonations and the way she moves her hands are all her, but if you sit with her for more than a few minutes, you learn she’s less like herself and more like a carnival hologram — repeating a limited, looping set of thoughts and comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have nine windows in my apartment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My cat is the best roommate I’ve ever had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Did I tell you your husband reminds me of my dad?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, my mother had been single and independent, living on her own, volunteering and singing in a local chorale. At 78, she was in excellent health and had great energy, so I was taken by surprise when she announced she’d be moving into a retirement community near my home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An old folks’ home?” I said. “But you’re in great shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a ‘home,’ it’s a retirement village. Just like apartment living, but I don’t have to cook anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No loss for the world there,” I snorted, and she elbowed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, we visited the facility, more like a resort with scheduled activities and concerts than the 1970s nursing home my paternal grandmother had lived and died in. But still. Weaving through walkers and motorized scooters to get to the facility’s restaurant, I said, “These people, they’re nice, but they seem… elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She squared off with me. At 5’1”, she projects an air of sweet amiability, but she’s actually stubborn as an old root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mother was sick my entire childhood,” she said. It was true. Her poor mother suffered for nine years, Bible in hand and disapproval on her face, until she finally died, releasing my 17-year-old mother. “I’m not doing that to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not remotely the same! I’m older, and you’re not sick, or nasty.” I looked at her sideways. “At least most of the time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our way out, we passed a locked industrial door, behind which was the “Assisted Living Wing” and “Memory Ward.” Pastel-colored cutouts of flowers and butterflies, the sort you’d see taped to a nursery school wall, decorated the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s in there?” I asked, and made scary ghost sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You, if you keep it up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It never occurred to me there might be something she wasn’t telling me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, age 2, with her mother&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 12, 2020, the day after Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced they had COVID-19, my mother’s Toyota Camry pulled into my driveway, and out she stepped with two suitcases, the food from her refrigerator, her recycling and her cat, named Jello, howling and spitting in its carrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just until we flatten the curve,” she said, reluctant to leave her apartment. “And not a minute more.” She lived with me for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother and I are different people. She’s fussy. I’m casual — sloppy, even. She’s soft-spoken. I’m loud. She’s ladylike. I intentionally storm through a room. And while I know I’m not the refined young lady she hoped for as a daughter, she’s been my champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I hated wearing dresses, so she sewed me pants. And when a male teacher told her, “Your daughter must wear dresses to school — pants are inappropriate,” she fired back, “You’re either going to let her wear pants, or you’re going to see her underwear, because she’s always upside-down on the monkey bars!” I got to wear pants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we managed to find joy and beauty in our togetherness during the lockdown. We visited the local arboretum, haunted our old town, even had a picnic on the porch of our old house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody lives here! Who’s going to care?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We peeked in the windows and tried to see if any doors were unlocked. She stood watch for me while I crawled under the porch to see if old treasures I had hidden were still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nothing but spiders and dirt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited her room daily with chocolate chip cookies. “Wellness check,” I’d say, and she’d invite me into her too-warm space. I’d nudge Jello, ever a grumpy thing, off the armchair and sit down for a quick chat over the blaring television. It was during one of those visits that I first noticed something was off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mom, you shouldn’t watch the news 24 hours a day. It’s grim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I leave it on for the company — the voices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You live with me. That’s enough voices for anyone. If you have to watch TV, can you at least watch &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/netflix"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;?” I handed her the remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That thing’s too complicated. I like the news,” she said and took a dainty bite of her cookie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For goodness’ sake! You just push this button here that says Netflix.” She waved me away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, she poured laundry detergent into our dryer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what I was thinking,” she said. “I’ll pay for it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s no big deal,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d once put the cereal box in the fridge and the milk in the cupboard. Our family can be spacey like that, so I wrote it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as her memory glitched more frequently, I found myself becoming impatient. It was easier to be annoyed with her, easier to look away from what might be happening to her, from what might one day happen to me. It was easier to imagine she was being lazy-minded or stubborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You just met with your surgeon two weeks ago, don’t you remember? Your pain is coming from your spine, not your hip, so you have to do physical therapy,” I told her one afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DO YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPY! And can you wear your hearing aids? It’s very annoying to repeat myself all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like physical therapy,” she said. “And anyway, you’re the only one I can’t hear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"This is Jello, and he's daring me to even think about coming any closer," the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our arguments regressed. We were silly, a little petty, almost joking, but not quite. I found myself using the same words she’d spoken to me when I was young, pantomiming a role reversal we didn’t realize was well underway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do as you’re told!” I’d demand, only half joking when she ate mostly chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re not the boss of me!” she’d say, and cross her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then she drove into oncoming traffic with my daughter in the car. It was a close call — the other car swerved. My daughter told me she’d never let Grandma drive her again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I took her keys that day, but I didn’t. It’s difficult — removing your parents’ means of transportation. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/uber"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; generation. You take their keys, you take their independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I called my mother while waiting in the social distancing line that snaked around Trader Joe’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank goodness you called! My phone isn’t working!” she said, breathless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re on your phone now, Mom,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t call anyone. I couldn’t find anyone’s numbers. I was all alone!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t upsetting that she couldn’t work her phone for a moment — many older people struggle with technology. It was upsetting that she was panicked, desperate and at a loss for what to do, when really, all she had to do was step out of her bedroom and ask any of her grandchildren for assistance. It was upsetting because she felt helpless and afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s going on, Mom?” I asked when I got home. It never occurred to me she could be any other than the way I had always known her: capable, pragmatic and independent. I didn’t know that these days — the early days — were the good days when she remembered where she was, who she was, who I was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day I took her keys was the day she mistook my daughter for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It was easier to be annoyed with her, easier to look away from what might be happening to her, from what might one day happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As intelligent, sentient beings, we sure can be shockingly unaware of our own emotions and why we’re feeling them. Recently, I was hiking in a forest near my home. I came upon an elderly woman in hiking boots sitting on a fallen tree near a brook, leaning on her walking stick. I couldn’t imagine how she had gotten there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She smiled. “I’m just taking a breather. I live a mile up there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed her stick up the steep, wooded hill. She’d come from Sweden decades earlier to marry an American who’d recently moved them into a retirement home. Like my mother, she was born on the cusp of World War II. Unlike my mother, she spoke about politics, current events, a book she was reading. Then she got up and stretched. I didn’t want her to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can I visit you, maybe help with your errands?” I asked. She looked at me, puzzled, and I felt instant embarrassment. This was not a woman who needed help with her errands. She had just walked a mile into the woods. Why would she need me to visit her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my husband’s pandemic projects was to hang birdhouses all around our yard. A storm knocked one down, and four bluish babies with giant open mouths tumbled out onto the grass. Blind, chirping and barely able to move, they reminded me of the P.D. Eastman book “Are You My Mother?” about a baby bird who searches for his mother. He asks everything he comes across: a dog, a hen, a steam shovel, “Are you my mother?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I slid a spoon under the wobbly birds’ bodies and poured them back into their home, I was struck by a thought: &lt;em&gt;I’m the baby bird in P.D. Eastman’s book. I’m looking for my mother, who is slipping away from me. And the lovely Swedish woman in the woods? She is not my mother. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author with her mother. "We were off on some pandemic adventure," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Kathryn Smith"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Kathryn Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months after my mom packed up Jello and moved back to her apartment, I got a call from the onsite nurse explaining she had accidentally consumed five weeks’ medication in two weeks. It was time for her to move into assisted living. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remembered the door with the flowers and butterflies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe she saw this coming. I believe she knew her mind was slipping, so she moved herself into a place where, at some point, she could get professional care, and where, like she said, she wouldn’t become a “burden.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the things she says in her moments of clarity is, “My parents died young. I didn’t have anyone to model getting old for me.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks to her, I do. And thanks to her, as the child of a person who is getting old, I’m learning to be more patient, more understanding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I call her daily. I visit her often. And every now and then, the mother I know returns for a cameo, then disappears just as quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her darker moments, she tells me, “I’ve had a good life, but if I could push a button and end it now, I would.” I’d like to tell her to hang on — that things will get better — but we both know that’s not true. So I just remind her she is beloved. And we list all the people who’ve loved her in her life, including the boyfriend she dumped in college. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m learning to love her differently, perhaps more deeply and from a place of gratitude, not of need and expectation. I’m trying to be the grown-up now — to champion her, the way she did me. It’s not easy. And in the wee hours of the night, when the loss of my mother as I knew her overtakes me, I allow myself to have a cry in my pillow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kathryn Smith has published fiction and creative nonfiction in Philadelphia Stories, poetry in Apiary, and twice won an honorable mention from Glimmer Train.

&lt;li&gt;For an extra-potent strawberry flavor, try using strawberry milk, or add a scoop of strawberry-flavored protein powder to get a boost of protein too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can garnish with any berry of your choice in addition to strawberries, as well as add a sprinkling of granola.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For extra pizzazz, top the pudding with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7953463/magic-chocolate-drizzle/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chocolate shell&lt;/a&gt; by melting dark chocolate and a bit of coconut oil together. Pour on top of the peanut butter mixture in the jar and chill for 10 minutes until the shell is hardened. Add a dash of flaky salt, if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To save time, you can skip making the peanut butter mixture and simply swirl peanut butter on top of the pudding. However, choose a peanut butter made with just peanuts and one that’s more liquid than solid so you get a perfect consistency.&lt;/li&gt;

Much of the fat in chia seeds is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are known to reduce inflammation and lower disease risk.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based milks&lt;/a&gt; that naturally contains protein.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten thousand steps a day&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most widely recognised numbers in modern health culture. It appears on fitness trackers, in health guidelines and across marketing campaigns. Despite its ubiquity, the origin of this figure is not medical. It began as a product slogan in 1960s Japan, not as a clinical recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent research has begun to challenge this long-standing benchmark. Multiple large-scale studies have found that the health benefits associated with walking may begin at lower daily step counts, and that the 10,000-step target may overstate what is necessary for longevity, disease prevention and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking remains one of the most accessible forms of physical activity. It is particularly relevant as public health agencies look for low-cost interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour and improve population-level outcomes. However, guidance on &lt;strong&gt;how many steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; are needed is now shifting toward a more evidence-based and personalised model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Step Counts and Mortality Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; tracked nearly 5,000 adults and found that those who walked &lt;strong&gt;8,000 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; had a 51 percent lower &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/bill-gates-admits-i-thought-i-was-one-mistake-away-from-death-with-microsoft-until-the-late-90s/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73393" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of death &lt;/a&gt;from all causes compared with individuals who walked 4,000 steps. The study also reported no significant impact from walking speed. Step volume alone was the defining factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further analysis from &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/how-many-steps-do-you-need-day-see-health-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt; notes that walking as few as &lt;strong&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; contributes to improved longevity, with benefits rising steadily up to about 8,000 steps. Among adults over 60, health improvements plateaued between &lt;strong&gt;6,000 and 8,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;, while for those under 60, the upper limit of gains appeared near &lt;strong&gt;10,000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate 2022 study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, walking between 8,000 and 10,000 steps per day was associated with lower risk of developing or dying from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/people-who-sleep-like-this-every-night-are-facing-dangerously-high-heart-risks-reveals-major-new-study/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="96135" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found no additional benefit beyond that range, indicating that efforts to exceed it may not yield proportional improvements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Weight Loss and Activity Intensity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although moderate daily steps may support general health, individuals targeting &lt;strong&gt;weight loss through walking&lt;/strong&gt; require greater volumes and structured activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data compiled by &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-miles-should-i-walk-a-day-8690702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/a&gt; shows that walking &lt;strong&gt;10,000 to 12,000 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; can support sustained weight loss when paired with at least &lt;strong&gt;3,500 brisk steps&lt;/strong&gt; in sessions lasting 10 minutes or more. Participants in one cited study who adopted this routine were able to maintain a &lt;strong&gt;10 percent reduction in body weight&lt;/strong&gt; over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="" alt="Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals" class="wp-image-101844" data-lazy-srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-380x257.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-520x352.jpg 520w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg" alt="Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals" class="wp-image-101844" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals.jpg 1000w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-380x257.jpg 380w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/daily-activity-adds-up-over-time-even-in-short-intervals-520x352.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Activity Adds Up Over Time, Even In Short Intervals. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.acsm.org/read-research/resource-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;strong&gt;225 to 420 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt; per week to support weight reduction goals. This translates to approximately &lt;strong&gt;2.5 to 3.5 miles daily&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;6,000 to 9,000 brisk steps&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on stride and pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings show a clear distinction between walking for general wellbeing and walking for targeted weight control, with the latter requiring more time, intensity and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sustained Movement Brings Broader Gains&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Emily Larson advises gradual increases in step count, recommending that individuals walking 3,000 steps a day aim to add 1,000 steps weekly. This type of incremental growth appears more effective than pursuing static step targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend distributing walking throughout the day. Multiple studies confirm that three sessions of 10 to 15 minutes can match the benefits of one continuous 30-minute walk. This structure supports individuals with limited time or those reintroducing activity after a sedentary period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health also points to the metabolic advantages of &lt;strong&gt;short walks after meals&lt;/strong&gt;. A 2022 study on post-meal walking found that walking for two minutes after eating helped regulate blood glucose more effectively than standing or remaining seated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all health gains require daily activity. One study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt; observed that walking &lt;strong&gt;four miles just once or twice a week&lt;/strong&gt; still produced positive effects on longevity. This is particularly relevant for people with limited mobility or time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revising Walking Targets for Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current fitness apps and trackers continue to promote the 10,000-step standard, yet researchers now call for more individualised benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; reports that walking &lt;strong&gt;4,500 steps per day&lt;/strong&gt; lowers the risk of cardiovascular events by up to &lt;strong&gt;77 percent&lt;/strong&gt; in older adults. Gains continued up to about 7,000 to 8,000 steps per day, but additional steps did not produce further significant reductions in risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking has also been linked to lower rates of several chronic health conditions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customised walking routines are also encouraged for people recovering from illness or living with physical limitations. Recommendations include &lt;strong&gt;pool walking&lt;/strong&gt;, use of &lt;strong&gt;mobility aids&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;short assisted walks&lt;/strong&gt; to maintain daily activity without strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mental health benefits are also well documented. UCLA Health references findings from the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2023/pandemic-coping-exercise" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; showing that walking for &lt;strong&gt;75 minutes per week&lt;/strong&gt; at a moderate pace reduced depression risk by 18 percent. Increasing the total to 120 minutes lowered the risk by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/7-ways-wearable-technology-can-help-you-reach-your-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wearable devices &lt;/a&gt;remain valuable tools for tracking daily movement, but researchers suggest shifting the focus from absolute step counts to personalised progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the research team, back pain is one of the most common health problems in Norway, with 60-80 percent of people experiencing it during their lifetime. In fact, they say, back and neck pain have the highest medical costs and represent an enormous burden to the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Our findings show the importance of finding time to be physically active in order to prevent not only chronic back pain but many other illnesses as well, which will translate into huge savings for society in the long run,” says NTNU Professor Paul Jarle-Mörck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Preventing Back Pain With Small Measures in Daily Life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The causes of chronic lower back pain are complex. It is thought to develop from a combination of various factors, including aging, poor posture, muscle weakness, and psychological stress. Conventional treatments have focused on medication and physical therapy, making it difficult to reliably prevent recurrence. The effectiveness of walking, a simple and low-cost method, has now been demonstrated, which may spark a major change in common sense regarding lower back pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The benefits of walking are not limited to lower back pain. Walking has a wide range of positive effects, which include improving cardiopulmonary function, maintaining bone density, weight management, and improving mental health. This research supports the comprehensive health benefits of walking, not limited to the single symptom of lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Small everyday changes, such as walking more when commuting or shopping, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, can help prevent back pain. Even for those who already suffer from back pain, these can be effective ways to reduce the risk of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Wear shoes, go outside, and walk. This may be the first step toward a future free of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wired.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRjNxQk43b3QyQWNwSDhWSloxN2ZVbmdhY3JtT2NDNFlPS2hIMGtqV3lubWQ2WmJzVlE1NmtNdXlSZGdPOWRwaW03N293V1FNSndjc3dWdmtxWFJJczVSaWxwVE9tdDI0MUoyQWI1Qy15LWxwbGhDczRZZUNBbzloTFpvTU40RVR4andwSGxzMkFIOVZZ</guid></item><item><title>大脑类器官正在帮助研究人员，但它们的使用也会造成不安- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2026/01/02/nx-s1-5658576/brain-organoids-research-ethics</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Research on conditions like autism, schizophrenia and even brain cancer increasingly relies on clusters of human cells called brain organoids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These pea-size bits of neural tissue model aspects of human brain development as they grow for months and even years in a lab. They also make many people uneasy, in part because the brain is so closely tied to our sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A group of scientists, ethicists, patient advocates and journalists &lt;a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/f6374d3a-7ab1-477d-8445-265e918699c0/summary" target="_blank"&gt;met for two days&lt;/a&gt; in Northern California this fall to discuss how scientists, and society, should proceed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Among the questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it okay to place human organoids in an animal's brain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can organoids feel pain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can they become conscious?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who, if anyone, should regulate this research?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are talking about an organ that is at the seat of human consciousness. It's the seat of personality and who we are," says &lt;a href="https://bioethics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/insoo-hyun" target="_blank"&gt;Insoo Hyun&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the Museum of Science, Boston, who attended the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's reasonable to be especially careful with the kind of experiments we're doing," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Societal issues by the sea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The event was hosted by &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/sergiu-pasca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Sergiu Pașca&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent organoid researcher whose lab at Stanford University used the technology to develop &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/30/1247900797/timothy-syndrome-genetic-disorder-brain-cells-restored" target="_blank"&gt;a potential treatment&lt;/a&gt; for a rare cause of autism and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Organoids are allowing scientists to study brain cells and circuits that don't exist in animals,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pașca says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have this ability to really work with human neurons and human glial cells," he says, "and ask questions about these really mysterious disorders of the brain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Pașca's work has sometimes caused public unease as his lab has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5358410/pain-pathway-in-a-dish-could-aid-search-for-new-analgesic-drugs" target="_blank"&gt;recreated a human pain pathway&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/10/12/1128356099/human-cells-in-a-rats-brain-could-shed-light-on-autism-and-adhd" target="_blank"&gt;transplanted&lt;/a&gt; a human organoid into the brain of a rat.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Of course, there are issues of ethics and societal implications and religious views that have to be taken into consideration," he says. Many of those issues were outlined in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aeb1510" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Pasca and others in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To take the next step, Pașca invited a group to the Asilomar Conference Center on the Monterey Peninsula. It's the spot where, 50 years earlier, another group met to hash out the first &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv3132" target="_blank"&gt;ethical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for genetic engineering.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Organizers of the organoid event had more modest expectations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our goal for this meeting was to just bring everybody together across all these fields and start brainstorming," Pașca says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That happened — in formal sessions, coffee breaks, after-hours social gatherings and even walks on the beach. And participants brought widely varying perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. reward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists and patient advocates at the meeting often emphasized the need to quickly answer questions and find cures.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bioethicists were more likely to speak about the importance of guardrails to make sure people consent to having their cells made into organoids, and to discourage any efforts to enhance the brains of animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was consensus, though, on the need to keep the public informed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When people hear about brain organoid research, they tend to have one overarching and quite reasonable question for scientists, says &lt;a href="https://law.wisc.edu/profiles/ralta.charo" target="_blank"&gt;Alta Charo&lt;/a&gt;, professor emerita of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"How far along are they in building organoids that can actually recapitulate something that we associate with human capacities?" she says. "Have we reached a point where we're worried?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not yet, probably. But the prospect seems closer now that scientists are linking multiple organoids to create more brain-like structures called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40249959/" target="_blank"&gt;assembloids&lt;/a&gt;, Charo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pasca's team, for example, has built a network of four organoids to model the pathway that carries pain signals to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That sounds disturbing, Charo says, unless you understand that this network of cells lacks the circuitry to feel pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The mere existence of the pain pathway, I think, is enough to give a public perception problem that the organoid or the assembloid is suffering," Charo says. "And yet, if the pathway that allows for this emotional aversion doesn't exist, then there's no suffering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And no ethical issue, for now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, she says, researchers and regulators should probably be looking ahead, rather than waiting until there is an actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A perception problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several participants faulted the media for glossing over the current limits on what organoids can do, and for describing these clusters of cells as "mini-brains."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That sort of coverage has led some people to falsely believe there are labs with "brains growing in a petri dish," says &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8945416" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Guo-li Ming&lt;/a&gt;, an organoid researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists need to counter that notion and explain how organoid research is helping people with life-threatening diseases, Ming says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her own lab, for example, is working to customize brain cancer treatment using organoids derived from a patient's own tumor cells. That allows doctors to ensure a cancer drug is effective for the patient's specific tumor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ming also thinks it's too soon to worry about organoids becoming conscious because "we're far from mimicking the brain activity in real human beings."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, organoid scientists "definitely need some guidelines," Ming says, because of current public concern and the potential for inappropriate research in the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New cells, old issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The ethical and societal issues surrounding brain organoids echo those related to stem cell research more than 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Back then, there was concern that neural stem cells might give animals human-like cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It turned out those human cells didn't do well in another species' brain. But organoids, which start out as stem cells, can thrive in animal brains and even integrate with their circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So what used to be a very hot issue in stem cell research has now come back," Hyun says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hyun was part of a group that worked on organoid guidelines for the International Society for Stem Cell Research five years ago, when the need for oversight seemed less pressing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We had a let's wait and see attitude," he says, because it was not clear how long it would take for organoid technology to become concerning. "We've gotten to the point rather quickly."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hyun's immediate concern is protecting research animals from organoid experiments that could cause suffering. But in the long term, he says, it may take guidelines and government oversight to ensure that organoid research doesn't harm, or horrify, people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Asilomar meeting suggests many scientists know that, and want help navigating this new scientific frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of the trial period, the women had significantly lower blood pressure. Although the composition of the gut microbiome itself did not change, the bacteria upped their production of chemicals known as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) – which are known to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="which-orange-juice-is-best?" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="which-orange-juice-is-best?" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Which orange juice is best? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, both nutritionists the BBC spoke to were keen to emphasise that whole fruit remains the preferred option and the healthier choice. Not only do oranges contain more fibre, but they also retain more flavonoids that are so beneficial for health. Polyphenols are the wider class of plant compounds to which flavonoids belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When you eat a fresh orange, the vitamin C and some of the more oxygen-sensitive nutrients [such as flavonoids] don't oxidise as much because they're still encapsulated within the fibre," says Amati.

Industrially produced orange juice, on the other hand, will have been pasteurised and heated – which could kill off some of the more oxygen-sensitive nutrients, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09637486.2024.2303034" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;such as vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPZWVMV3NNN3BXTWo0TlMtZ2hZbjBWekdZNy1UaGtDQ3pkQzM3M1dYMXAwUUhjX3NRUzZJY0hoR1BtUktYX01NRzlScVQyWW94Skdqb2hXVm9VcHRWR1pZSllvOFFMZURmNHhrQzl6RXBDYWJGTzJsOUtqYVE3N2c0WEJsZlRRUmdMNFhoWllBX0RRR25jNzVDa1ZZaFkyc0pJREFr</guid></item><item><title>在欧洲和美国蔓延的“超级流感”是什么？ - wired.com</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-super-flu-spreading-in-united-states-europe/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/flu"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; became more severe this fall, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank"&gt;designated the&lt;/a&gt; 2024-25 flu season &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank"&gt;as the most severe season&lt;/a&gt; since 2017-18. In the UK, the spread has begun earlier than at any time since 2003-04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Against this backdrop, some media &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1rryv2ryo"&gt;outlets&lt;/a&gt; have begun &lt;a data-offer-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-super-flu-and-other-questions-answered-271959" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://theconversation.com/what-is-super-flu-and-other-questions-answered-271959"}' href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-super-flu-and-other-questions-answered-271959" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; the term “super flu.” However, this term is not an official medical term. The actual name is “subclade K,” a new variant of influenza A H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This variant has multiple mutations in a protein on the surface of the virus called hemagglutinin, making it antigenically different from the variants used in existing vaccines. This allows it to partially evade immunity acquired through previous infection or vaccines, making people more susceptible to infection. Genetic analysis by the UK Health Security Agency has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that 87 percent of H3N2 viruses detected since late August 2025 are subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;The Outbreak Began Earlier Than Usual&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The term “super flu” is not necessarily scientifically accurate. The H3N2 strain already caused severe illness in the elderly and children, and the new mutant strain has not made it more deadly. Contrary to the name, the virus's inherent danger is said to be no different from the conventional H3N2 strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2025, the US influenza pandemic peaked in early February, with active epidemics occurring in 87.3 percent of the country. For 11 consecutive weeks, more than 50 percent of the country &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2025-2026-influenza-activity.html" target="_blank"&gt;recorded high epidemic levels&lt;/a&gt;, an anomaly that led to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;287&lt;/a&gt; child deaths. However, these figures reflect the scale of the epidemic and do not imply an increase in the lethality of the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The influenza epidemic is hitting earlier this year in many parts of the world. While the usual peak in Japan occurs between late December and February, in 2025 the epidemic began in earnest at the end of September. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, of the 23 H3 virus strains collected in Japan between September and November 5 that could be analyzed, 22 were subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The reason for the early outbreak is thought to be the decline in immunity of the population due to the countermeasures against &lt;a href="https://wired.jp/tag/covid-19/"&gt;new coronavirus infection (Covid-19)&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a decline in physical strength due to the record-breaking heat wave. During the three years of the coronavirus pandemic, the influenza epidemic was largely suppressed. As a result, it is possible that population immunity to the virus was reduced. In fact, with the 2024 influenza pandemic in Australia &lt;a data-offer-url="https://ausvacs.com.au/2025-flu-vaccination-proposal/2024-flu-season-summary/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://ausvacs.com.au/2025-flu-vaccination-proposal/2024-flu-season-summary/"}' href="https://ausvacs.com.au/2025-flu-vaccination-proposal/2024-flu-season-summary/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at its highest level&lt;/a&gt; since 19 years, it would not be surprising to see a similar trend in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Existing Vaccines Are Effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There has also been much interest in vaccine efficacy in the face of this virulent strain. The vaccine for the 2025-26 season is based on the conventional J.2 lineage (subclade), which has different antigenicity from subclade K. However, early data from the UK has confirmed that 70-75 percent of vaccinated children and 30-40 percent of adults did not end up visiting the emergency room or being hospitalized after infection. This means that even if the antigenicity is not completely identical, the vaccine remains effective in preventing severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The basic prevention measures are the same as for conventional influenza. Vaccination is recommended from October to November before the epidemic, and the effect appears about two weeks after vaccination. It is particularly recommended for people aged 65 and over, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, children aged 6 months to 5 years, and medical workers. In daily life, it is effective to thoroughly wash and disinfect your hands, and wear a mask when in crowds. Ventilation in rooms and maintaining appropriate humidity levels are also important in suppressing viral activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wired.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNTUZreGUzMWtUY3lzVVRreW1UNE1tZlNOTzdWTmZWRVF5V2FhVFhucVgwYWhfeGhrRlFibmdyaVZvUW03SVpDSTNqa0ZDNEtDaEh4T0trcG1yNHBJS01KaHRPRmNNbmxUdGFGc3hjUHRfVHdrbjJrbkZZTzk0elFfU1V1MGg1RXc</guid></item><item><title>胰腺癌是最致命的癌症之一。宾夕法尼亚大学正在测试的一种新药给患者和医生带来了希望。-费城当地新闻、体育、就业、汽车、房源</title><link>https://www.inquirer.com/health/pancreatic-cancer-treatment-penn-drug-trial-20260102.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article-body-light "&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Irene Blair was expected to have another six to eight months to live in June, after her pancreatic cancer rapidly advanced to stage 4 less than a year after her initial diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;A new drug being tested in clinical trials around the world, including at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, was the 59-year-old grandmother from Newark, Del.’s best hope for more time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The drug belongs to a class of pharmaceuticals long considered the holy grail of cancer research. It is a KRAS inhibitor, capable of blocking a protein that fuels an especially deadly cancer. Only 13% of pancreatic cancer patients are still alive five years after their diagnosis, the highest mortality rate of all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Called daraxonrasib, the drug is not considered a cure. But the results emerging from clinical trials point to the first major advancement in decades for a devastating cancer usually caught in late stages. Former Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse last week disclosed in a blunt social media post that he was recently diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer and is “gonna die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In recent months, the federal government has sped up the review timeline for the drug made by California-based company Revolution Medicines, Inc., based on early clinical trial results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Across 38 patients in a phase 1 trial, the drug appeared to double the survival time for at least half of patients compared to standard chemotherapy, from roughly seven months to 15.6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“In pancreatic cancer, for too long, we haven’t had effective therapies beyond just chemotherapy,” said Mark O’Hara, Blair’s oncologist who leads multiple clinical trials testing KRAS inhibitors at Penn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Blair started the therapy through a phase 3 trial in July. Within three weeks, her cancer-associated pain went away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In October, her tumors looked stable or decreasing on scans. Her most recent December scan showed her cancer had not progressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Aside from occasional facial rashes, she feels normal. It’s a big improvement from how she felt previously on chemotherapy, which caused her to lose 35 pounds and become so weak she couldn’t walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The question now is how long the therapy can remain effective. Blair seeks&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;extra time to “start living life.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;She officially retired from her job in real estate in May and wants to travel, with trips planned to see family in California and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Holidays have been especially hard for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“You just wonder, ‘Will I be here next year?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;How does the therapy work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Cancer researchers have worked to design a drug targeting KRAS, a protein that acts like a “gas pedal” for cancer growth when mutated, since its discovery in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The mutant protein is like a pedal stuck in the down position, driving uncontrolled proliferation — which tumors thrive on. These mutations are found in a quarter of human cancers, mostly aggressive cancers of the pancreas, lung, and colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Scientists finally succeeded in 2021, when the first drugs capable of blocking KRAS were approved by the FDA for lung cancer. Dozens of KRAS inhibitors are now in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;various stages of development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Daraxonrasib is one of the first tested for pancreatic cancer, a tumor type where nearly 90% of cases have these mutations. Also called a ‘pan-RAS inhibitor,’ it not only targets KRAS, but two other related proteins that drive cancer when mutated, HRAS and NRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;More than 90% of the 83 patients in a phase 1 trial saw their pancreatic cancer stall during treatment, and roughly 30% saw shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;While taking the drug, at least half of patients gained more than eight months&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;before the cancer started progressing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The drug comes in the form of three pills, taken daily at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The most prevalent side effect is a rash — 91% of patients in a phase 1 trial experienced this symptom, with 8% having severe cases. It often shows up on the face or scalp and is similar to acne, O’Hara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and mouth sores are other common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;O’Hara said these are manageable with medications for most patients and still allow them to have a better quality of life than chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“I want to be able to give KRAS inhibitors to all my patients right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;O’Hara runs multiple trials of KRAS inhibitors at Penn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Some of them are testing the inhibitor as a treatment for patients with metastatic cancer after other options have stopped working.&lt;b&gt;

But by late April, her back pain returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Two months later, more scans showed that the cancer was now considered stage 4, as it had metastasized to her liver, forming 10 to 15 new tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Her best option was to enter a clinical trial of daraxonrasib at Penn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Much to her relief, she was chosen&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to receive the drug in July upon enrolling in a study in which half of patients are randomized to receive chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“It’s enabled me to start living again,” she said, but knows eventually the therapy will likely stop working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In that case, doctors may try the standard chemotherapy — which usually works for three to four months — or test a different therapy based on her cancer’s genomic profile, O’Hara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;For now, she described herself as “living scan to scan,” seeking as much time as possible with her son, grandchildren, and husband. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Blair’s next evaluation is in February.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A recent review in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; highlights resistant starch — the type naturally found in beans, bananas, and cooled potatoes — as a surprising carb that may improve blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and even support weight management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before eating large amounts of day-old rice, experts say it’s not a magic fix. Adding resistant starch to a diet high in refined carbs and sugar won’t undo the damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, dietitians recommend a bigger-picture approach: Build meals around fiber-rich foods such as legumes, whole grains, and vegetables to support gut health and achieve lasting benefits for blood sugar, cholesterol, and overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, carbohydrates — particularly refined ones found in white bread, pasta, and rice — have been vilified in the wellness world. But a lesser-known type of carb might be ready for a redemption arc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent review of studies in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1636551/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a specific type of starch known as resistant starch may help improve blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and even support weight loss. Even better? You might already have foods containing this starch in your fridge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Resistant starch occurs naturally in foods such as beans, bananas, and potatoes. Cooking and cooling certain starchy foods can also increase their resistant starch content. Think: leftover rice, pasta salad, and cold roasted potatoes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you start chilling every carb in sight, dietitians say the science is more nuanced than social media makes it seem. “The particular benefits of this are significantly overstated,” says &lt;a href="https://desireerd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Desiree Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, RD, host of &lt;a href="https://desireerd.com/podcast/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Allsorts Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and author of the cookbook &lt;a href="https://desireerd.com/books/good-for-your-gut-cookbook/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good for Your Gut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simply adding resistant starch to a diet otherwise rich in ultra-processed foods won’t undo the effects of excessive sugar, refined carbohydrates, or saturated fat. “If you’re looking to add a resistant starch into your pattern of eating in a meaningful way while making sustainable shifts in multiple areas, then you’ll reap the benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://mayafellernutrition.com/people/maya-feller-ms-rd-cdn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maya Feller&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDN. “There’s no way to sugarcoat this. Eating this way has been happening for thousands of years in Indigenous communities.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Should you try to incorporate more resistant starch into your diet? The science is still emerging, but here’s what experts say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-resistant-starch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What is resistant starch? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s a category of carbohydrates that are not digestible,” says Feller. Unlike regular starches, which break down into sugar in the small intestine, resistant starch remains intact and reaches the colon. There, it ferments and feeds your gut bacteria — a process that offers surprising health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-five-types-of-resistant-starch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The five types of resistant starch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are five types of resistant starch, each with a different impact on the body, says Feller: “Depending on the cooking method, the quantity of resistant starch can actually differ, and that is what I think is so exciting.” Here’s the breakdown:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS1:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in whole plant foods such as legumes, whole grains, seeds, and vegetables. Their tough cell walls make them harder to digest, which contributes to their health-promoting properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS2:&lt;/strong&gt; Found in raw, unripe starches such as green bananas, raw potatoes, and uncooked legumes. Their crystalline structure resists digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS3:&lt;/strong&gt; Formed when starchy foods such as rice, bread, or potatoes are cooked and then cooled. Cooking makes the starch digestible, but cooling alters its structure, making it less digestible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS4:&lt;/strong&gt; A synthetic version created by chemically modifying starch. Think of fiber-added snack bars or sugar-free candies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RS5: &lt;/strong&gt;Produced through industrial processing, in which starches bind to fats to form indigestible complexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nielsen recommends focusing on RS2 and RS3 sources because they resist digestion differently from RS1, making them more potent prebiotics that ferment in the large intestine — thereby promoting gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-the-potential-health-benefits-of-resistant-starch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What are the potential health benefits of resistant starch? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A long-term study of U.S. adults, published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.1004667/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, found that people who ate more resistant starch had a lower risk of dying from cancer or any cause at all (besides cardiovascular disease). The study followed participants for 19 years and demonstrated a strong correlation between resistant starch consumption and improved health outcomes. That said, researchers note that we still need more studies to determine precisely how much to eat for the greatest benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “We used to say, ‘We are what we eat,’ but now the thinking is, ‘We are what we digest and absorb.’” says Nielsen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424112/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2024, found that rats fed mung beans, a high-resistance-starch food, had a 96% reduction in blood sugar. Among humans, a small 2015 study published in the journal Nutrition of people classified as overweight or obese showed that consuming 15 to 30 grams of resistant starch per day was linked to improved insulin sensitivity in overweight men but not in women, suggesting that more research is needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6551340/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; Nielsen cites found that 10 to 45 grams of resistant starch per day improved insulin sensitivity among people classified as overweight or obese. “When people have a pattern of eating that is higher in fiber in general, including resistant starches, they tend to have better blood sugar control, lower blood pressure, and a lower lipid profile,” says Feller.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with high cholesterol, Feller recommends adding a wide variety of fiber to your diet — including resistant starch — to help improve your numbers. Once those lab results start moving in the right direction, she says, other benefits often follow: better sleep, clearer thinking, and, for many people, a bit of weight loss, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sort of. But don’t expect miracles from day-old rice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Is it significant? It’s not as big as you expect,” says Nielsen. Cooling rice can double its resistant starch content after 24 hours in the fridge, but the total amount isn’t huge on either side: It rises from about 1.2 grams to 2.4 grams. “It’s great, but not a huge difference,” says Nielsen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead, dietitians recommend increasing your overall fiber intake by eating more nuts, legumes, produce, and whole grains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “What actually matters is what you pair with the rice,” says Feller. “So if you're eating white, black, brown, or red rice, are you having beans with it? Are you having non-starchy vegetables?”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To see potential blood sugar benefits, aim for 10 to 40 grams per day, says Nielsen. For people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), even five grams of RS2 (such as green bananas or raw potato starch) can positively affect gut bacteria without triggering excessive bloating. However, more than 10 to 20 grams may be too much for some people.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook rice, pasta, or potatoes, then chill for 24 hours before eating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze sliced bread, then toast slices as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap half a cup of wheat flour for &lt;a href="https://store.edwardandsons.com/products/organic-banana-flour" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green banana flour&lt;/a&gt; in baked goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add green banana flour to smoothies (with extra liquid to promote digestion).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;a href="https://manitobaharvest.com/collections/hemp-hearts" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;hemp hearts&lt;/a&gt; to smoothies or yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat the rinds of soft squashes and skins of potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, especially if your current diet is low in fiber. Suddenly loading up on resistant starch (especially from raw legumes or green banana flour) can cause bloating, gas, or worse. Nielsen recommends introducing it slowly to keep digestion moving.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After talking to three different cardiologists, we gathered the best, safer alternatives to concerning kitchen materials such as microplastics and PFAS, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bentgo-Signature-Leak-Proof-Glass-Storage/dp/B0F122SZ82/?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;plastic-free containers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B087XBR564?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reusable silicone bags&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bees-Wrap-Reusable-Beeswax-Extra/dp/B08BWVXP6Y?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;beeswax wrap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Classic-10-Piece-Cookware-Stainless/dp/B0FQD52NTK?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stainless steel cookware&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Skillet-Pre-Seasoned-Skillet-Silicone/dp/B00G2XGC88/?tag=eatingwell-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cast-iron cookware&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All three doctors expressed concern about materials such as microplastics, lead and PFAS. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors want you to remember that swaps should be sustainable, realistic changes based on your budget and specific needs, and encourage you to prioritize your heart health in a variety of ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new year is a great time for change—it’s exactly why resolutions came to be. And if you ask me, 2026 already has a strong theme: Many people want to make better choices for themselves, whether that’s the food they eat or the exercise they commit to. I am the same way, which is why I’ve been reaching out to experts for their advice. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommended-kitchen-gadgets-amazon-11762566" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cardiologists have some of the most fascinating perspectives&lt;/a&gt;, as cardiovascular health intersects with many different aspects of our well-being. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In light of what was one of the biggest topics of 2025—kitchen toxins &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-limit-microplastics-in-your-food-11713723" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;like microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, PFAS (aka forever chemicals), lead and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/banned-flame-retardants-found-in-cooking-utensils-8723612" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;flame retardants&lt;/a&gt;—I asked three cardiologists for their honest advice: Do these materials interact with heart health? What should we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; avoid and why? And how can we do this in a manageable way? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After polling cardiologists, doctors were most concerned about three well-known toxins: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fda-lead-leaching-cookware-replacements-amazon-11833814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, plastics, and forever chemicals., Specifically, two out of the three doctors said microplastics were their biggest worry, while one flagged lead and PFAS. What ties these three together is that they can adversely impact heart health, and there are manageable ways to reduce your daily exposure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “My goal as a cardiologist is not to create fear, but to help people make practical, evidence-based choices that fit into real life and meaningfully support long-term heart health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/juan-c-rozo/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nocaes"&gt;Dr. Juan Carlos Rozo, MD, FACC, FASE, RPVI&lt;/a&gt; at Houston Methodist Hospital. “I am concerned, but in a measured, evidence-based way. For Dr. Rozo, his biggest concern is with lead and PFAS since we have the most data to support them, noting that “these [materials] are all well-recognized drivers of cardiovascular disease.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.advancedcvmiami.com/physicians/pedro-martinez-clark" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow nocaes"&gt;Dr. Pedro Martinez-Clark, MD, FACC&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Amavita Heart and Vascular Health who has spent 26 years treating heart disease, is “particularly alarmed by recent breakthrough studies that have identified microplastics in human arterial plaques.” If he could choose one material to focus on, it’d be micro- and nanoplastics. “What makes this particularly urgent is that microplastics are nearly impossible to avoid completely; they're in our water (even tap water), food packaging, dust in our homes and the air we breathe. The average person may be ingesting tens of thousands of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/common-products-sources-of-microplastics-11863406" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; annually,” he notes. &lt;a href="https://bestheartbeat.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow nocaes"&gt;Dr. Andrew Rudin, MD&lt;/a&gt;, agrees, adding that “these plastics contain chemicals that can disrupt endocrine function as well as cause inflammation and oxidative stress resulting in obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, hypertension, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-heart-disease-risk-11833680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and cancer.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what can we do about it? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Patients can take meaningful action to reduce microplastic exposure more readily than they can address some other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/forever-chemicals-endocrine-disruptors-expert-kitchen-swaps-amazon-11795890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it an ideal starting point for those who feel overwhelmed about where to begin," says Dr. Martinez-Clark. We’ve tested a wide range of different &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/50233/must-have-kitchen-tools/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;kitchen gear&lt;/a&gt;, many of which can be considered safer alternatives to products containing microplastics, lead or PFAS. Below are our best recommendations.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-glass-food-storage-containers-8387775" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;storage containers&lt;/a&gt; are made with glass and silicone. I have been testing them at home for four months, and I really appreciate how durable and airtight they are. Whether I store food in the freezer, refrigerator or pantry, the lid’s seal ensures food stays fresh for days on end. Because there’s no plastic, I never worry about keeping food frozen and stored inside, even if it's for months at a time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A great alternative to plastic bags, Stasher’s silicone storage options are excellent for keeping ingredients fresh. Use them for sandwiches, snacks, produce and more. We particularly love them for the freezer because of their sturdy material and tight seal—a rarity with plastic versions.

I’ve used these everywhere from professional kitchens to at-home set-ups, and they always hold up. This model is a good starting point for the brand. It’s made with maple wood, is 1 inch thick for durability and lasts for years with proper care.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cookware, reaching for simple materials like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-stainless-steel-cookware-8706088" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stainless steel&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. We love Calphalon pans for their design, durability and fair price. This set is an excellent choice for many cooking applications. The 10-inch frying pan sears and sautés beautifully, while the 2.5-quart saucepan bubbles sauces and heats food with ease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cooking tools, I always recommend these wooden spatulas for a true multi-tasking option. The slim design and hard edges make it excellent for scraping, tossing, stirring, flipping and more. Once you have one of these, you’ll likely reach for it over every other tool. They’re handmade from wood and have lasted me for years, even with daily use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Doctors want to reiterate that they don’t want you to make a 180-degree change, and that this isn’t the only way to manage heart health. Always do what works best for you and your budget. “Perfect is the enemy of good. I counsel my patients to focus on high-impact, sustainable changes rather than trying to eliminate every possible risk, which is both impossible and can create unhealthy anxiety,” says Dr. Martinez-Clark.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPNDdSN3NnWWJDUm9ocnFZOXpzN3ZMWGp6MHB3RV9feTI4Qy1RVHZSTlRnYUNmbjdXcGt0RGlnSTZNdnFfdF9FUEJveHpfampZazQyV3E4QzRXdnhtWUZFaHRtYUdGVmh2a25yaFUwMDFWUFhHcHBGMUp3eDl3Mm9fVU1MUTRBWWhBMm0w</guid></item><item><title>不要紧张，少做事： 2026年让生活更轻松的52种方法-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/01/ways-to-make-your-life-easier-2026</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he dawn of a new year brings visions of an idealised version of yourself. Fresh-faced, we eagerly pile our to-do lists with things we’ve been putting off and ambitions to aim for. But the energy that comes after a few days off quickly disappears as we settle back into the daily grind of school runs and inbox maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So instead of adding to your to-do list, why not resolve to take something off it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="daily-tasks" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Daily tasks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;1. Professional organiser Susan C Pinsky says you &lt;strong&gt;don’t need to fold&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;every piece of clothing&lt;/strong&gt;. A drawer of jumbled underwear, but only underwear, is organised enough. For extra credit, if you reduce your socks to two styles and have multiple pairs of each, you will never need to sort, match or roll your socks again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Stop sending so many emails&lt;/strong&gt;, says Moyra Scott, a productivity and wellbeing expert. The more you send, the more you get back, so only reply if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;3. Another reason to stay out of your inbox? Organisational psychologist Dr Amantha Imber says this kind of “shallow work”, which also includes messaging over Slack or Teams, &lt;strong&gt;wastes energy that could be put towards bigger tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Skip that multivitamin&lt;/strong&gt;. People should stop wasting their money on health supplements, says Dr Jason Yu, a Sydney-based GP. They often have very minimal scientific evidence to support their claims, and a pill can’t correct unhealthy lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a08df11f-34f8-4126-a60d-e29a9e2a6453" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is it true that … you’re more likely to get sick when you’re stressed?","elementId":"a08df11f-34f8-4126-a60d-e29a9e2a6453","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/29/is-it-true-sick-stressed-ill"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;5. You don’t need a complicated outfit to look stylish, says Zara Wong, a fashion editor and consultant. The easiest way to look put together is to &lt;strong&gt;wear the same colour head to toe.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not only striking, but a paint-by-numbers way of getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;6. Forgo moisturiser and&lt;strong&gt; just wear sunscreen&lt;/strong&gt;, says Prof Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at the Skin Hospital. Sebaratnam says most people don’t need to routinely wear moisturiser unless they have skin conditions like eczema. Plus, most sunscreens have moisturising properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;7. Similarly, you only need to &lt;strong&gt;use one or two well-formulated products&lt;/strong&gt; with a few active ingredients to tackle specific skin concerns, says Michelle Wong, a science communicator with a PhD in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;8. Put your phone down and &lt;strong&gt;stop looking at your investments,&lt;/strong&gt; says superannuation specialist Marco Mellado. Prices move constantly, with no clear rhyme or reason. If you have a solid long-term plan, daily fluctuations don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;9. People use too much of every spice when cooking south Asian meals. &lt;strong&gt;Using fewer spices in the right quantities&lt;/strong&gt; can bring out deeper flavours, says Nipun Liyanapathirana, culinary creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Take the shame out of your dinner&lt;/strong&gt;. There’s so much pressure on home cooks to make something special every night, says Bundjalung restaurateur Mindy Woods. But many food cultures don’t cook for applause. They cook to nourish, sustain and carry people through the day. If that means repeating a meal, remind yourself that feeding you and your family well is already a worthy feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;11. If your room is always a mess, stop setting yourself up for failure by promising you’ll start putting your clothes away at the end of each day, says Guardian reporter and author of &lt;a href="https://tr.ee/jEhBx3mVxq" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The ADHD Brain Buddy&lt;/a&gt; Matilda Boseley. Instead, designate a “clothes chair” in your room or put a “clean clothes” basket next to your washing basket. &lt;strong&gt;Give yourself permission to be messy&lt;/strong&gt; – just give that mess a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cd4c778-fb2d-4fb7-b298-5f1753817624" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="getting-through-the-week" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Getting through the week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;12. Many parents try to smooth every bump, rushing in to fix and protect, says Alice Peel, a primary school teacher and co-founder of mental health social venture Grow Your Mind. But &lt;strong&gt;letting your child solve their own problems&lt;/strong&gt; gives them an opportunity to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;13. Let your garden take care of itself, too. &lt;strong&gt;Stop spraying pesticides and insecticides unnecessarily&lt;/strong&gt;, says nursery manager Thea Kerr. They interfere with the garden’s ecosystem and aphid populations can be controlled naturally by predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;14. &lt;strong&gt;Embrace gentle movement when recovering from an intense workout&lt;/strong&gt;. Although it’s tempting to push through when you’re sore, it often delays recovery, says associate professor Bruno Saragiotto, head of physiotherapy at the University of Technology, Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;15. Exercise doesn’t need to involve overly complicated moves either, says Dr Kim Way, an exercise physiologist at Deakin University. &lt;strong&gt;Stick to simple exercises that you enjoy&lt;/strong&gt; and feel confident doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;16. And &lt;strong&gt;if cool-downs are a drag, you can skip them&lt;/strong&gt;, says Shona Vertue, a personal trainer and yoga instructor. Contrary to popular belief, research indicates that active cool-downs don’t significantly reduce muscle soreness, prevent injuries, or improve recovery in a meaningful way after weight training. But if you enjoy winding down after a workout, by all means keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;17. Do you end the week with aching feet? Charbel Dagher, a podiatrist from Clear Step Podiatry, says &lt;strong&gt;your shoes probably aren’t the problem, or the solution&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people over-rely on cushioned shoes or insoles for a quick fix. Addressing the underlying causes of foot pain will do more in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;18. Streamline your grocery shop. &lt;strong&gt;Delicious dishes don’t need lots of ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; and according to Jo Barrett, chef at Discovered Foods, we buy too many. Look for recipes that only require a handful of ingredients and a method you feel confident following – these often end up being the most memorable meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;19. &lt;strong&gt;Stop wasting money on probiotics bought off the shelves&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, grow your own gut flora by eating a diet that is rich in low-processed, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/17/15-easy-delicious-eat-more-legumes-pulses-beans" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;plant-based ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, says Prof Emad El-Omar, a gastroenterologist and director of the University of New South Wales Microbiome Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;20. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t overload your laundry with commercial stain removers&lt;/strong&gt;. Not every product works for every stain. Shannon Lush, know as the queen of clean, suggests working out the cause of a spot before tackling it, lest you accidentally set it. You probably have everything you need to get rid of it at home already. Bicarb soda and water brightens whites, while white vinegar lifts greasy stains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;21. Everything loses its appeal once it lands on a to-do list. &lt;strong&gt;Stop scheduling sex like it’s a chore&lt;/strong&gt;, says Georgia Grace, sex and relationship practitioner. It adds pressure to the moment and can make it feel performative rather than pleasurable. Instead, schedule intentional time to connect physically, emotionally, or erotically without the expectation that it must lead to sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="700e41d6-1d96-4e16-ba7e-6d30e7abf350" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="enjoying-yourself" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Enjoying yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;22. &lt;strong&gt;Forget the fancy gadgets and complicated brew methods&lt;/strong&gt;, says Jibbi Little, a coffee professional. You only need one thing for a good cup of joe: high quality beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;23&lt;strong&gt;. You don’t have to grit your teeth trying to finish art you hate&lt;/strong&gt;, says Guardian Australia culture editor Steph Harmon. If you don’t like the first 20 pages of a book, stop reading it. If you’re bored by a film or TV show, switch it off. Leaving a terrible play at intermission is exhilarating. There’s more brilliant culture out there than anyone could possibly see in one lifetime, so cut your losses and find something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;24. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t worry about staying for a whole party&lt;/strong&gt;, says Jenny Valentish, journalist and reformed sociophobe. Recognise that you have a window of tolerance, spend quality time with the host, then leave once the party gets going if you’re not feeling up to it. It’s better to be around for a good time rather than a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;25. &lt;strong&gt;Stop comparing your sex life to others&lt;/strong&gt;. Do what works for you and the people you are in a relationship with, says clinical sexologist Naomi Hutchings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;26. And during the act itself, &lt;strong&gt;let go of what your sexual partners might think of you or your body &lt;/strong&gt;and focus on how your body feels. This will help keep you present and increase your pleasure, says Kassandra Mourikis, sexologist and relationship therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;27. For overseas visitors, friends with kids or big group hangs, organising a time to meet can be excruciating. &lt;strong&gt;Replace the never-ending back and forth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;texts&lt;/strong&gt; with a&lt;a href="https://www.when2meet.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; when2meet&lt;/a&gt; link, says Isabella Lee, production assistant at Guardian Australia. This handy site lets people pick the days and times that work for them, then suggests the best dates based on everyone’s availabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;28. Don’t try to see everything when you go on holiday. It adds pressure you don’t need, says Intrepid Travel’s managing director ANZ, Brett Mitchell. Instead of racing between highlights, &lt;strong&gt;go to fewer, less-visited places&lt;/strong&gt;. Doing less doesn’t mean missing out – it’s often how you experience more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="469bbfa5-e67c-4485-8bf0-c4d168b24c3b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":36,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The perfect morning routine: how to build a happy, healthy start to the day – from showers to sunshine","elementId":"469bbfa5-e67c-4485-8bf0-c4d168b24c3b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/perfect-morning-routine-happy-healthy-start-showers-sunshine"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;29. &lt;strong&gt;Give yourself a day of grace when returning from a trip&lt;/strong&gt;, says Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor at Guardian Australia. Going to work the day after you land just loads your future self with extra chores. If you plan a day at home to sleep, unpack, get groceries and settle in, your holiday will still feel like a holiday when it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;30. Take the goon bag off the hills hoist and prepare your finest glassware. Sommelier Samantha Payne says &lt;strong&gt;you don’t need to spend big to drink well&lt;/strong&gt;. Quality cask wine has come leaps and bounds &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/apr/24/australia-best-cask-wines-taste-test-sommelier-samantha-payne" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, and keeping some in the fridge means you can have a glass of wine without opening a whole bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;31. Coco Chanel is often credited with the adage that before you leave the house, you should take one thing off. The same idea applies to arranging your home, says interior designer Emma Blomfield. Many people over-accessorise flat surfaces and wind up with a space that looks messy and overdone. &lt;strong&gt;Stick to having just three to four pieces on display &lt;/strong&gt;and you’ll have less to dust too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;32. &lt;strong&gt;Kids don’t need elaborate birthday parties or gifts&lt;/strong&gt;. For many toddlers and primary-school aged children, a park play and cake will do just fine, says Guardian deputy lifestyle editor Yvonne C Lam. If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; put on a do, try a “fiver” party – in lieu of gifts, ask guests to pop $5 in an envelope, which can go towards one item your child wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;33. If you’re trying to grow your social circle, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t need to worry about making a best friend&lt;/strong&gt;, says Michelle Lim, associate professor of public health at the University of Sydney. Small moments of connection, like saying hello to someone at the bus stop, can do a lot to alleviate loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;34. Don’t worry about dressing for your age, your body, or for how other people might view you, says fashion sustainability adviser Camille Reed. &lt;strong&gt;Just wear what makes you happy&lt;/strong&gt;. She says: “Wear the bright colours. Show the arms. Dress to impress you!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-things-go-wrong" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;When things go wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;35. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t feed your pet before a trip to the vet&lt;/strong&gt;. Going to the doctor is already a stressful experience, says Anne Quain, a senior lecturer at the Sydney school of veterinary science at University of Sydney, so don’t add the complication of a big meal prior. Eating makes your animal more likely to get sick in the car and, if they arrive on an empty stomach, they’ll be more receptive to treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;36. &lt;strong&gt;If you find yourself out of work, don’t take a “spraying and praying” approach&lt;/strong&gt; by applying for every job you see, says Ellen Hooper, a career coach. Instead, Hooper recommends spending time contacting former colleagues and using existing networks to search for job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;37. If you’ve got deep-seated anxieties about money, &lt;strong&gt;influencer tips and get rich quick schemes won’t help you&lt;/strong&gt;, says Zee Heart, co-founder of MoneyGirl.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t fall for them – unfollow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;38. If you’re in a tough spot, stop dieting, says KC Davis, self-care advocate and author of Who Deserves Your Love. Your brain runs on glucose, so a crisis is not the time to skip the carbs, fat or protein. &lt;strong&gt;Focus on getting enough calories into your body&lt;/strong&gt;, not on whether your meals are nutritionally perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;39. Embrace a bit of healthy conflict, says Marryam Chehelnabi, clinical psychotherapist. Avoiding a fight backs us into a corner and restricts us from fostering happiness and connection, so instead of tying yourself in knots trying to keep the peace, &lt;strong&gt;air your grievances when they come up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;40. &lt;strong&gt;You don’t need to fill awkward silences to ease someone’s grief&lt;/strong&gt;, says Sally Douglas and Imogen Carn, creators of the Good Mourning podcast. Instead of offering solutions or platitudes, the most powerful support can be simply sitting beside someone, listening without judgment and allowing space for their grief to exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="50ae66e3-0689-4162-8aad-7bd5456712df" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="planning-for-the-future" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Planning for the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;41. If you’re planning a renovation, &lt;strong&gt;don’t overlook orientation&lt;/strong&gt;, says Anthony Burke, host of ABC’s Grand Designs Australia and architecture professor at University of Technology, Sydney. Maximising the advantages of the sun for natural heating and cooling means you can hopefully forgo air conditioning and additional insulation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;42. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t design your home for the next buyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Too many houses feel like copies of each other: on-trend, forgettable and designed with resale in mind, says interior designer David Flack. Your home isn’t a showroom, it’s where life happens; design for yourself&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;43. Don’t obsess over self-optimisation and biohacking. It feels like taking control, but it’s often just repackaging anxiety and control as data points, says clinical psychologist Zac Seidler. Sometimes good enough really is good enough – &lt;strong&gt;your body isn’t an algorithm to hack&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ec788e07-472a-436e-b2bc-0b365a8ecff3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":55,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The secrets of the body clock: how to tune into your natural rhythms – and have a better day","elementId":"ec788e07-472a-436e-b2bc-0b365a8ecff3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/26/secrets-body-clock-natural-rhythms-better-day"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;44. We all have that one item we can’t get rid of for sentimental reasons, but when you’re decluttering, &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to hold on to things out of obligation&lt;/strong&gt;. If you no longer want or use something, professional organiser Catherine Carney says it’s OK to appreciate the thought and let the item go without feeling guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;45. &lt;strong&gt;Stop planning your career to the exact detail&lt;/strong&gt;, says Lois Keay-Smith, a career counselling practitioner. The modern career is all about adaptability, information and making connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;46. There are plenty of metrics that go along with parenting, but many are best ignored, says Dr Fiona Longmuir, senior lecturer in educational leadership at Monash university. &lt;strong&gt;Stop focusing on data outputs as measures of success for children&lt;/strong&gt; and instead think about developing them as young humans, as opposed to A+ students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-you-need-a-reality-check" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;When you need a reality check&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;47. &lt;strong&gt;Stop holding your partner responsible for your own “stuff”&lt;/strong&gt; says Dr Orna Guralnik, clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. Our emotions are our responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;48. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t live to post&lt;/strong&gt;. When every move we make can end up at the mercy of the internet, it’s tempting to play it safe, say Maggie Kelly and Tully Smyth, co-hosts of the Self Help(ed) podcast. But we should worry less about our online “social contracts”. Your digital footprint doesn’t define you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;49. Parents spend too much energy trying to shape their children’s behaviour, says Lael Stone, a parenting educator. &lt;strong&gt;Children learn most from watching who we are&lt;/strong&gt;, not what we say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;50. &lt;strong&gt;Let go of ageist beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;, says Dr Catherine Barrett, founder of Celebrate Ageing. When you see the value in older people, it transforms your experience of interacting and working with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;51. &lt;strong&gt;Don’t worry about what others around you are doing&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to live a life guided by Stoic philosophy, understand that what other people do or say is out of your control, says author and journalist Brigid Delaney. All you need to worry about is how you are acting and responding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;52. If all else fails, &lt;strong&gt;just stop saying yes&lt;/strong&gt;, says Helena Nguyen, a professor in work and organisational studies at the University of Sydney. People-pleasers be warned: each yes is a little withdrawal from your energy account and you can’t show up well for others if you’re emotionally overdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

However, what about foods that slowly damage your brain? According to Dr. Austin Perlmutter, MD, it is not refined carbs, or fried food, but something you consume on a daily basis, almost every day—yes, we are talking about sugar, and specifically liquid sugar, aka sugary drinks. Let's take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of sugar-rich beverages and sweetened foods leads to brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40902134/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; through gradual processes when these items are consumed every day. The brain functions through a few essential elements which include memory, mood, focus and dementia risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Unhealthy 5 letter foods you should avoid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The process of sugar entering your brain system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumption of cola, packaged juice, energy drinks and sweet tea leads to fast sugar entry into the blood and brain. Your body needs to produce a large amount of insulin when blood sugar levels rise suddenly, and this process occurs multiple times throughout years which leads to brain insulin resistance. The brain depends on glucose for its operation but requires a continuous and controlled flow of this substance, instead of experiencing rapid increases and decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High sugar intake over several years causes brain cell &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11446400/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by triggering inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweet drinks, kids’ brains, and attention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early exposure to sugary drinks is especially harmful for young, developing brains. Studies connect high intake of sugar-sweetened drinks in babies and children with more attention and behavior problems later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large Korean cohort study showed that children who consumed more than 200 ml of sugary drinks daily, before their second birthday developed ADHD at a higher rate than children who drank less. Other studies in Spain and China report that frequent soft drink intake in school-age children links to higher ADHD risk and poorer cognitive performance scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Memory loss and thinking problems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prolonged intake of large sugar amounts results in detrimental effects that harm memory functions, learning abilities and information processing capabilities. Symptoms like brain fog and poor focus will appear first before the condition advances to its next stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies based on cohort data show that children who drink too many sugary beverages at a young age, will achieve lower IQ levels as adults based on their cognitive test performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who drink too much sugar and sweetened beverages, face health dangers that harm their brain function because these drinking habits raise their risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Artificial sweeteners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt; do not help much&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching from sugar to “zero-calorie” sweeteners may not fully protect the brain.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Trying to lose weight can feel overwhelming, especially when it seems like your favorite foods are off-limits. While no single food causes weight loss, small, realistic changes can make it easier to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/reasons-not-losing-weight-in-a-calorie-deficit-11773522" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain a calorie deficit&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One simple option is choosing lower-carb versions of everyday staples, like bread.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that you don’t need to follow a low-carb diet to lose weight.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, swapping in a lower-carb bread can modestly reduce calories for those who regularly eat toast or sandwiches, without giving up foods you enjoy.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of bread can make it easier to lower calories without feeling restricted,” explains Pratt. Because the bread contains added fibers that may be harder for some people to tolerate at first, she suggests starting with one slice and seeing how your digestion responds before increasing your portion.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Low-carb bread isn’t required for weight loss, but it can be a helpful tool for some people—especially if it makes meals more satisfying while slightly reducing calories. “Think of low-carb bread as one option that can support you if it helps you meet your protein and fiber goals while still enjoying your food,” says Sheth.

(WPVI) -- &lt;/span&gt;A Montgomery County business owner is continuing to recover in the hospital after being diagnosed with a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection, a medical emergency that has kept him hospitalized since mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Peter Atkinson, 49, of North Wales, has been at Doylestown Hospital since Dec. 19 after doctors diagnosed him with necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson said the hospital's swift response saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If it wasn't for the help of this hospital, I would definitely be dead," Atkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson said his illness initially felt like the flu. He described spiking a 104-degree fever and noticing a mass in his chest area before seeking medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"How did I get this? How did this happen? Apparently, it's rare, but it's not that rare because it happened to me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He said doctors quickly realized the severity of his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I showed them, and it was like, wow, not even five minutes later, he came and said, 'We have to do emergency surgery.

His sister, Marietta Atkinson, said the experience has been especially painful given their family's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Probably one of the most traumatic events in our life, second traumatic event. In 2016, we lost our sister to sepsis, very similar to what Pete had," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Family members said Atkinson began to show signs of improvement on Christmas. His wife, Sherri Paulson-Atkinson, described the emotional toll of seeing her husband hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My husband is a fighter, he's a go-getter, he is always busy, and to see him laying there like that was really hard for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson owns a towing company and is unable to work for the foreseeable future.

Purge the fridge, the freezer, and the pantry. Make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/16-year-old-up-girl-death-cause-junk-food-pizza-pasta-burger-neurologist-reacts-to-claims-real-cause-reveals-truth-maggi-101766657776901.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="junk food"&gt;junk food&lt;/a&gt; inconvenient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meal prep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The heart surgeon advises preparing meals in advance - before you get hungry - so that nutritious options are always within easy reach, reducing impulsive food choices and making it far easier to stick to healthier eating habits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He explains, “Meal prep before you get hungry. Meal preparation makes healthy choices more convenient rather than using convenience to justify unhealthy choices.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reward yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rewarding yourself for small wins can build motivation and encourage you to keep making healthy choices. Dr London stresses, “Acknowledge when you follow through on the promises you make and reward yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share your wins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist explains that sharing even small wins with your loved ones can make the journey more enjoyable while also creating a sense of accountability that helps you stay committed to your goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; He highlights, “Win with others. Not only is it more fun to share small wins with otherst, but it can help hold you accountable. Focus on progression over perfection. The goal isn't to jump on a short-term diet, but to build a sustainable nutritional plan.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;Banner Health on Thursday is initiating mandatory masking at all facilities across the six-state healthcare system due to a significant surge in seasonal influenza to protect patients, visitors and staff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Masking will be required for patients, visitors and staff in all Banner locations where patients are present until further notice. Patients admitted to Banner hospitals are not required to mask in their hospital rooms. Masking will be encouraged in non-patient areas as well. Masks will be available at all public entrances to Banner facilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This measure is necessary because older patients and those with immunodeficiencies are at heightened risk and these extra precautions will help safeguard our most vulnerable populations,” said Marjorie Bessel, MD, Banner Health chief clinical officer. “Our top priority is to protect our patients, staff, and the communities we serve by reducing the spread of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new subvariant of influenza A, H3N2, is leading to higher infection rates although the seasonal vaccination remains highly effective against severe disease and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flu kills tens of thousands of people each year,” Dr. Bessel said. “Our masking plan will help us protect everyone, especially high-risk groups including those 65 and older, children 2 and under, pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A reminder of other best practices to help stem the spread of communicable disease, including the flu:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;· Wearing a mask in crowded areas, such as airports, on public transportation or at indoor events&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;· Handwash or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer frequently&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay home if you’re feeling ill&lt;br&gt;· Stay current on recommended vaccines, including the flu vaccine&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A Catholic influencer announced Thursday that his 5-year-old son had died after an 11-day battle with a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/cold-and-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;severe case of the flu&lt;/a&gt;, a loss that unfolded publicly as he shared updates almost daily online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Paul J. Kim, who shares faith-based content with more than 300,000 followers &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS-hIiekZBe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, said his son Micah died on New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an emotional video posted Thursday, Kim thanked supporters &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;for their prayers&lt;/a&gt; and asked for privacy as his family grieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are so proud of him," Kim said in the video. "I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, as his dad, on behalf of my family, for all the ways you guys &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prayed and lifted us up&lt;/a&gt; during this time. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever been through in my life, and it continues to be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim first shared news of Micah’s illness Dec. 21, when he posted that his son was being taken to a hospital by ambulance after a medical emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/aggressive-new-flu-variant-sweeps-globe-doctors-warn-severe-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘AGGRESSIVE’ NEW FLU VARIANT SWEEPS GLOBE AS DOCTORS WARN OF SEVERE SYMPTOMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The young boy was taken by ambulance Dec. 21 to a hospital. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In subsequent updates, Kim said doctors described Micah’s illness as an unusually severe case of the flu. Kim later told followers that Micah had been placed on life support and urged people to pray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later updates, he revealed that the flu infection had turned septic and triggered seizures. At the time, Kim said doctors described the case as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/rare-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rare and serious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Dec. 30 update, Kim said his son’s condition had worsened and that Micah was in a coma as doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt; worked to give him as much time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/record-breaking-flu-numbers-reported-new-york-state-sparking-warnings-from-officials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECORD-BREAKING FLU NUMBERS REPORTED IN NEW YORK STATE, SPARKING WARNINGS FROM OFFICIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to recent data, the CDC reported 288 pediatric flu deaths in the recent 2024-25 season.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kim’s posts&lt;/a&gt;, some of which showed Micah in the hospital, were viewed millions of times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the ordeal, Kim referred to his son as a fighter and "my hero."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written Instagram post, he quoted Job 1:21, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord" and said Micah had entered "the never-ending glory, love, and peace of God." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that while his family’s hearts are broken, they continue to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rely on their faith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim also asked followers to pray for his family as they learn "how to live by faith and not by sight." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/celebrity-trainer-says-tennessee-community-saved-his-5-year-old-daughter-during-cancer-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CELEBRITY TRAINER SAYS TENNESSEE COMMUNITY SAVED HIS 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DURING CANCER BATTLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kim first shared news of his son's illness Dec. 21. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent data, the CDC reported 288 pediatric deaths in the 2024-25 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been a record high for a non-pandemic year, mostly among unvaccinated kids, with 70% having underlying conditions like asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a new so-called "super flu" strain has emerged this season, a mutation of influenza A H3N2 called subclade K.

A commercial ran that appeared to promote that obesity is a perfectly healthy lifestyle and, if you think otherwise, you're fat-shaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more bizarre is that the commercial was created by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), a company that produces several drugs targeted toward obese people, including Zepbound, a drug you've likely seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZAjEkVpANI"&gt;promoted in other advertisements&lt;/a&gt;. Lilly also makes Mounjaro, a drug to help treat type 2 diabetes. That's another drug you've likely seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuZbEGk6yZc"&gt;hundreds of TV advertisements promoting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="featured featured-image component-center"&gt;&lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;During the College Football Playoff at the Rose Bowl, Eli Lilly aired a halftime commercial that many viewers read as endorsing obesity as healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sub-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad featured a young man, who we're supposed to think is an athlete, speaking at what appears to be a press conference. The young man essentially attacks internet fat-shaming and says his life choices are no one's business but his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been dieting since I was 12. You think I need to hear about your workout routine? You don't stop to ask about mine," the man says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, to be fair, very few people would likely be interested in the workout routine of someone who looks like him. But I digress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I do, you're gonna have your own thoughts, so get it all out while you're in the comment section. I'll be focusing on what really matters, like how I feel when I'm waking up in the morning, like showing up for people I love. My health is my focus, and my body is nobody's business," he concludes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There Are So Many Problems With This Commercial &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, the ad was made by Lilly. Lilly running a commercial that says obesity is healthy is like McDonald's running an ad that says eating Big Macs will make you rich. Neither is true, but it certainly behooves the company to tell you that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is that McDonald's isn't actually running a commercial that says eating Big Macs will make you rich because that's ridiculous. But Lilly is running multiple commercials &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=401057382526530"&gt;saying that obesity is healthy&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it actually is the business of other Americans if their fellow citizens are obese, because we pay billions of dollars in taxes and a lot of that money &lt;a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-much-does-federal-government-spend-health-care"&gt;goes into government-funded health care&lt;/a&gt;. Obese people put more strain on the health care system than non-obese people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obese people, on average, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2640491/"&gt;spend more time in hospitals&lt;/a&gt; according to studies. So, the more obese people there are in the country, the less space there is available for other people seeking treatment from doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't the only person to notice the obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not fat-shaming to tell someone they are overweight and should try to lose weight; in fact, it's quite the opposite. It shows that you care about their health. No matter &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/dove-soap-brand-slams-oscar-winning-film-whale-using-fat-suit-want-better-representation"&gt;how much money companies spend&lt;/a&gt; trying to pretend like being fat is simply a lifestyle choice akin to what clothes you choose to wear, it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jrs-highly-anticipated-maha-report-paints-dismal-state-child-health-national-security-concerns"&gt;Obesity isn't healthy&lt;/a&gt;. Telling someone to eat right and exercise isn't fat-shaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly knows that, but here's the part they also know: if everyone in America simply ate healthier and exercised more, they'd make a lot less money. That's why they &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/financial-information/annual-reports"&gt;pour millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; into these types of advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They know that's a drop in the bucket compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.carsongroup.com/insights/blog/getting-big-by-selling-slim-eli-lillys-rise-to-1-trillion/"&gt;billions in profits&lt;/a&gt; from their weight-loss and diabetes drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OutKick</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 01:17:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxORGtUYVA0VVZtZ09sTjYwVWdQMDlNcm1WUWVPWk9SZ0NDQl9pMG1SVFo3OTRmOGpZZS14bnhaX3VPZU1CdGZsN3hld1R1ckZOR1VTVFROSGRkTkJhZHB5X05YMWhpWGRHaG5LdFhxWmNiWUVLX2tHQ2hOWnVIbzZReURlUHRWdw</guid></item><item><title>英国各地开始为NHS儿童接种水痘疫苗- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgexe201n81o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Chickenpox vaccines for young children start across UK&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 gXJgDY"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 gqeTMs"&gt;Philippa Roxby and Smitha Mundasad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 bIfajQ"&gt;Health reporters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f527/live/35a82830-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A young toddler looks up at a doctor who is holding a vaccine while rubbing a piece of cotton wool on his arm.

The main feature is an itchy, spotty rash which blisters then scabs over. It can be painful, and cover the body from head to toe. Children often feel unwell for several days, with a fever and muscle aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also spreads easily. Some 90% of children under the age of 10 catch chickenpox at some point, and a week off school or nursery is fairly common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But it can develop into something more severe, warns Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"For some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Complications can include bacterial infection of scabs, and much more rarely, a swelling of the brain known as encephalitis, lung inflammation known as pnemonitis, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Young babies and adults are more likely to be seriously ill with the infection.

There were concerns over the costs of a UK-wide vaccination programme and a potential rise in cases of shingles - when the chickenpox virus is reactivated in adulthood - but that has not been found to be an issue after many years of vaccination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Recent research also shows the scale of the impact of chickenpox on children and the NHS. An estimated £24 million in income and productivity is lost every year in the UK due to chickenpox in childhood, NHS England says. It also calculates that the vaccine rollout could save £15 million a year in NHS treatment costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For all those reasons, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the vaccine on the NHS in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Families will save both time and money - no longer facing lost income from taking time off work or having to fork out for private vaccinations," Streeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was "welcome news" that a vaccine was being rolled out across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile the Royal College of GPs said all NHS childhood vaccines were safe and effective, adding that jabs were "some of the most important health interventions parents can make for their children".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Who can get a chickenpox vaccine, and when?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Close-up of a spot-covered chest of a young boy with chickenpox - the spots are red and blistered, covering his torso, neck and chin" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Protection against chickenpox is offered in a new, combined vaccine called MMRV, which will replace the current MMR jab.

DHHS also noted that 40 Utahns have been diagnosed with measles over &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51416341/utah-has-a-115-confirmed-cases-of-measles-with-latest-infection-at-bingham-high" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;the past three weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Utah Health District leads the state's case count with 114 confirmed infections, followed by the &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51422706/6-new-measles-cases-reported-in-utah-county" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah County Health District&lt;/a&gt; with 16, and the Wasatch County Health District, which has a total of 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's rise in measles cases is just a glimpse of the virus's impact across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, the Utah-Arizona border, as well as the upstate region of South Carolina, which have all seen ongoing outbreaks of the virus have continuously added to the dozens of reported cases each week, &lt;a href="https://corecms.ksl.com/tools/cms/article/51425709" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, there have been 2,065 confirmed measles cases reported in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;. A higher annual total of infections than the country had seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah-Arizona border accounts for more than 350 cases reported between the two states alone in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 2,065 measles cases across the U.S., 11% of those have resulted in hospitalizations; with three confirmed deaths due to the illness, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the country had 2,000 cases of measles reported in one year was in 1992, which was a couple of years after health leaders updated recommendations to say that children should get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine instead of just one, CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past quarter-century, measles has been considered eliminated in the United States. Since 2000, no outbreaks or other chains of transmission have lasted longer than a year. But now multiple large outbreaks in 2025 may be connected, which puts the elimination status at risk, if cases continue to grow through late January, according to CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC,  measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, but the MMR vaccine offers effective protection. Health officials state that one dose of the vaccine is 93% effective against measles infection and a second dose provides 97% protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the CDC said vaccination rates have been on the decline for several years, especially among young children. During the 2024-25 school year, only 92.5% of incoming kindergarten students have received the MMR vaccine, which is below the 95% threshold, health officials say, is necessary to alleviate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 156 individuals in Utah who contracted measles in 2025, the DHHS said 140 of those were not vaccinated. Nine of those were vaccinated and seven patients' vaccination status was unknown, &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;according to the department's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 350 to 400 calories while the lunches span 350 to 400 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_203-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although adequate protein plays an important role in weight loss, there are other lifestyle factors that work hand in hand to support lasting results. These include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_204-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_205-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise&lt;/strong&gt;: While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; provides the building blocks your muscles need to grow and function properly, exercise is the trigger that stimulates muscle growth and helps your body use that protein effectively. For this reason, it’s recommended to do strength training exercises at least twice a week to boost muscle and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You should also participate in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week. This includes walking, dancing, biking or water aerobics.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good quality sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Diet and exercise may be important, but if you aren’t getting enough sleep, you may not see the weight loss results you desire. Studies show that inadequate sleep is linked to increased cravings, particularly for foods high in carbohydrates and fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Aim for at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management&lt;/strong&gt;: If you feel like you’ve tried everything to lose weight and nothing is working, managing stress may be the missing piece to the puzzle. Chronic stress exposes your body to high levels of cortisol, which is linked to the development of obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try meditation, breath work, therapy, socialization or getting regular fresh air and sunshine to help reduce stress levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, as his dad, on behalf of my family, for all the ways you guys prayed and lifted us up during this time,” Kim said in the video. “This incredibly difficult, impossible time for our family. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever been through in my life, and it continues to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d12275" class="body-graf"&gt;On Dec. 21, Kim &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSjAAswjuSX/" target="_blank"&gt;posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; that his son was heading to the hospital in an ambulance after “having a medical emergency.” The next day, he posted an update on Instagram saying Micah was on life support and asked for prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670532" class="body-graf"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS3vY0XjRe-/" target="_blank"&gt;update on Dec. 30&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said his son had a severe case of the flu, which caused the child to go septic and experience seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1772d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctors are saying it’s one of the most horrific cases of this virus that they have ever seen in their life. It’s very rare, what happened to my son,” Kim said. “Rest assured, he needs a miracle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0fd335" class="body-graf"&gt;Kim posted updates nearly daily since then, several including videos of the 5-year-old unconscious in the hospital. In Thursday’s video, Kim said his son was in a coma before he died and that “his soul was already with the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5511a" class="body-graf"&gt;“In many ways, we were fighting for Micah to buy him as much time as possible, until he passed,” he said. “As a father, that is my duty.

            16:24 pm&lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Micah Kim, the 5-year-old son of popular Catholic speaker Paul Kim, has passed away, Kim announced in a tearful social media post Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Micah died on Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025, after &lt;a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/268727/popular-catholic-speaker-pleads-for-a-miracle-amid-son-s-medical-emergency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;more than a week on life support&lt;/a&gt; following a rare medical emergency brought on by a severe case of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;“Micah Joseph is beginning the new year basking in the never-ending glory, love, and peace of God,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS-hIiekZBe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Kim wrote in the post&lt;/a&gt;, which was accompanied by a two-part video. “Micah has been very busy already, as I see the Lord using him and sending him on missions to bring millions of people closer to God.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Kim asked for privacy for his family as they grieve but said he felt he had to provide an update to the millions of people praying for Micah and his family throughout the ordeal. He shared that over the last week and a half, his social media account has been viewed more than 50 million times by people from all over the world offering prayers for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;p class="my-4 lightest-grey-bg py-3 body-ad" id="div-gpt-ad-1439931607151-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Micah was rushed to the hospital a week and a half ago after experiencing severe internal bleeding and other complications. Kim, a devoted husband and father of six known for his engaging talks on faith and family at Catholic conferences, first alerted followers via social media on Dec. 22: “My son Micah is having a medical emergency right now and headed to the hospital in an ambulance.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;By Dec. 24, Micah underwent emergency chest surgery to address the bleeding, which successfully stabilized his heart function. Kim shared on social media that after the surgery, his son’s heart began beating independently and his vital signs remained steady.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;Doctors gradually reduced life support, with Micah’s lungs showing slow improvement on a ventilator. However, a subsequent MRI revealed severe brain damage, leading physicians to conclude there is “no medical possibility” of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t be a prouder father,” Kim said in his Jan. 1 post. “This reality gives me great joy and hope in the midst of sorrow. Our hearts are broken; but we trust in the Lord. Please pray for my family and me as we learn how to live by faith and not by sight.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;p class="my-4 lightest-grey-bg py-3 body-ad" id="div-gpt-ad-1441212700470-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                                    &lt;p&gt;
                
              &lt;/p&gt;
                                              &lt;p&gt;Cardinals, bishops, priests, deacons, and laypeople — including many well-known Catholic media personalities — had messaged Kim and told him they were praying for his son, he said. Kim had prayed the Divine Mercy Chaplet live with followers during the ordeal, and the family had asked for a miracle through the intercession of Venerable Fulton Sheen.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;In addition to an outpouring of prayer for Micah, a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracle-for-micah-support-the-kim-family" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;GoFundMe campaign&lt;/a&gt; was begun to support the family amid mounting medical costs.&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;“Thank you for all the love, prayers, and compassion that a countless number of you have showed us,” Kim wrote. “May God truly bless you. Your prayers for Micah were answered, but in a different way than what we had all hoped for. God healed and welcomed him into eternal life. He is where we all want to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
                                                          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amira Abuzeid contributed to this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aliaaizenstat.com/"&gt;Alia Adlakha&lt;/a&gt; has built &lt;a href="https://www.insighttherapy.center/"&gt;Insight Therapy&lt;/a&gt; as a reflection of both personal history and deep professional experience.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Santa Barbara fostered an early awareness of how powerful support systems can be in moments of crisis, while also revealing the quieter, often unseen struggles families and individuals carry behind closed doors.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That dual perspective continues to inform her therapeutic approach, which is grounded in compassion, presence and a deep respect for each person’s lived experience.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, Adlakha worked extensively with youth and families throughout Santa Barbara County, including roles at &lt;a href="https://ahasb.org/"&gt;AHA!&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ccecsb.org/"&gt;Community Counseling and Education Center&lt;/a&gt;, and as a school-based therapist at &lt;a href="https://www.dunnschool.org/"&gt;Dunn School&lt;/a&gt; in Los Olivos.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone_load_849176498"&gt;&lt;noozhawk-zone place="0" callback="zone_load_849176498" zone-id="67458" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,collin-harmon,homes_lifestyle,collin-harmon-therapist-builds-practice-on-compassion-community-connection,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/noozhawk-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through leading groups, offering psychoeducation, running after-school programs, and providing individual therapy, she connected with hundreds of clients from diverse backgrounds.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiences sharpened her understanding of community-based mental health needs and reinforced the importance of early intervention, prevention and relational support.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also planted the seed for creating a group practice devoted to helping people feel seen, supported and empowered, a place where healing is not only clinical but deeply human.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adlakha’s perspective on mental health is further shaped by her family’s legacy. Her father was a founder of &lt;a href="https://www.pacifica.edu/"&gt;Pacifica Graduate Institute&lt;/a&gt;, an institution known for its focus on depth psychology, mythology and the inner life.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up around that environment nurtured a respect for curiosity, imagination and listening beyond surface level symptoms.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood memories of playfully imitating the role of a therapist and an enduring love for meaningful conversation reflect how naturally this path unfolded.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, those values are woven into Insight Therapy’s culture, from its emphasis on soul-centered work to the thoughtful design of its space, including the Healing Coast Art Exhibit featuring the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/chis/index.htm"&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/a&gt;, which reinforces a sense of calm, reflection and connection to place.




&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinically, Adlakha specializes in trauma-informed care, anxiety, depression, family systems, and the impact of screen use and digital stress on mental health.



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiences sharpened her understanding of community-based mental health needs and reinforced the importance of early intervention, prevention and relational support.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a strong foundation in child development and emotional regulation, she approaches therapy with both structure and empathy, helping clients understand not only what they are experiencing, but why.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framework guides Insight Therapy’s mission to support people in reconnecting with themselves, strengthening relationships, and finding balance in an increasingly overwhelming world.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insight Therapy works with children, adolescents, adults, couples and families. The practice offers a wide range of modalities, including acceptance and commitment therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing trauma-informed therapy, internal family systems, somatic and mindfulness-based approaches, attachment-focused work, and play-based therapy for children.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language access is another cornerstone of the practice, with services currently offered in English, Spanish, Armenian and Russian.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessibility remains a central priority, with insurance options, sliding-scale opportunities, and a continued commitment to making high-quality mental health care approachable, inclusive, and deeply rooted in genuine human connection.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Health officials are warning that Georgia is experiencing one of its most severe flu seasons in years, with cases and hospitalizations climbing sharply across the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists Georgia among the states with "very high" flu activity, and doctors say the season's peak is still ahead.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the most severe years we've seen in a little bit," said Dr. Gavin Harris, an infectious disease specialist with Emory Healthcare. "The amount of flu cases and the increase in positive test results are unlike anything we've seen in almost a decade."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Department of Public Health reported more than 300 flu-related hospitalizations in metro Atlanta during the most recent week of tracking. &lt;a href="/article/news/health/dekalb-reports-a-significant-surge-in-flu-related-illness/85-af7cdcf0-659a-48b2-9d56-12c6a10d830c"&gt;DeKalb County has also seen a 60% increase&lt;/a&gt; in flu-related 911 calls, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emory Healthcare has opened a 24/7 flu hotline (404-544-9358), staffed by nurses who can help patients determine whether they need a virtual visit or in-person care. Harris said the goal is to keep hospital capacity available for the most serious cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If there's a way to preserve healthcare capabilities, it's by rapidly triaging and getting people connected with care and treatment," Harris said. "If we can safely do that in an outpatient setting, we can preserve the capacity of our emergency rooms and clinics."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors across Georgia report high flu activity in both outpatient clinics and emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are anticipating, unfortunately, that these next few months could be pretty rough," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an Atlanta physician, urged residents not to skip vaccination, noting it still provides strong protection against severe illness. "It is never too late to get your flu vaccine," Reddy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris added that while this year's vaccine may not perfectly match all circulating strains, it remains "incredibly effective at preventing severe cases and hospitalizations."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicians said people struggling to tell whether they have a cold or the flu should pay attention to the severity of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High fever, body aches, and fatigue are more likely to signal influenza, Harris said — symptoms he described candidly as feeling "like you got hit by a truck."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Illy was a well-known Scottish &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/vtubers/"&gt;VTuber&lt;/a&gt; who was transparent about her struggles with &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disease that progressively fills the lungs and other organs with mucus, causing breathing problems, infections, and issues absorbing nutrients from food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;In August 2025, Illy created a fundraiser for her ‘bucket list,’ which included activities like seeing a Vocaloid concert, going to conventions and theme parks, and “throwing a big party” with her friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;“She was rushed to the hospital,” Drumsy said in a &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; video explaining the situation. “I got a call from her mom letting me know that the doctors said there was nothing else they could do. They kept her medicated and made sure that she wasn’t in pain. She passed away peacefully in her sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Fans were left heartbroken at the news, sharing their support for Illy’s friends and family and reminiscing on their favorite moments from her broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;“Illy was by far my favourite because of her personality and doing the dumbest stuff possible with the biggest smile on her face,” another said on X. “Thank you so much, Illy, for being yourself and just doing what you liked and loved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;To end his video, Drumsy shared an audio recording from Illy during one of their last collaborations together, where she thanked her fans and supporters for rallying around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exoskeleton for the entire arm has been invented and designed in Norway to help stroke victims recover the use of their arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It detects and then amplifies tiny movements through the arm and shoulder, and the developers hope to launch it as a fully commercial product this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, more and more people are surviving strokes, and living longer and longer with  disabilities resulting from them. This creates the need for better therapies, accommodations, and regenerative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://viljebionics.com/vre-brukere"&gt;Vilje Bionics&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the shoulder-mounted exoskeleton, says that most below-the-elbow prosthetics are for amputees, an few if any exist for victims of partial paralysis—like Johanne Marie Hemnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Hemnes suffered a brain hemorrhage and collapsed in her living room. The resulting stroke paralyzed her down her left side—usually the result of a stroke in the right half of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All her rehab and focus was on the left leg to ensure she could walk again, and while that was successful, her arm was entirely neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I call my arm Jenny, because it feels like it’s not a part of me, because it doesn’t do what I want it to do,” she&lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/11/08/this-is-the-worlds-first-entire-arm-exoskeleton-giving-stroke-patients-more-independence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; told Euro News&lt;/a&gt;, adding that she even considered cutting it off because it just got in the way. “But when I actually have this on, it feels like me again. It doesn’t just feel like another human being’s arm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vilje Bionics’ robotic arm assists movements for the shoulder, elbow and hand, which makes it the world’s first exoskeleton for the entire arm. Many of the components were 3D-printed, and Vilje’s founder Saeid Hosseini, says it works by the user “thinking how they’d use their arm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because if you think, you make a small movement and then it amplifies that movement,” Hosseini said. “It detects very small movements of a residual movement of a paretic arm and amplifies those movements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXOSKELETON INVENTIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 people have trailed the Vilpower exoskeleton so far, and the company hopes it will be ready in the first 4 to 6 months of 2026 starting in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic arm may be used for rehabilitation purposes in the future, but the company is currently focusing on helping “patients with lasting and significant disabilities to be more independent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Stroke Organization, one in four people will suffer a stroke at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemnes has been able to get used to cutting vegetables and opening bottles again, exactly the kind of independence Hosseini wants his product’s users to be able to reclaim.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Kentucky health officials are warning the public after a case of measles was confirmed in northern Kentucky earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post on the Kentucky Department for Public Health's Facebook page said it has "identified potential measles exposures in Grant County, Kentucky." According to the post, the exposure was traced to "an unvaccinated, out-of-state traveler" who stayed at the Holiday Inn &amp;amp; Suites in Dry Ridge from Dec. 28-30. That person also visited the Ark Encounter on Dec. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, can cause serious health problems, especially in young children and the elderly. The virus spreads through the air after someone infected coughs or sneezes. It can then linger for up to two hours after the infected person leaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can also be spread if someone touches surfaces that an infected person has touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by white spots that appear on the face and down the body. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is the best protection against measles, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact your healthcare provider if you think you or someone in your family may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Local News:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/politics/heres-a-look-at-who-s-running-and-what-s-at-stake-in-kentucky-s/article_5d13b267-215a-4a5b-b378-361ab697ff8e.html" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a look at who’s running and what’s at stake in Kentucky’s 2026 elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6433"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/woman-critical-after-shooting-at-american-legion-post-in-parkland-early-thursday/article_4fa05d9b-c356-4f28-946a-23c5e6d8eed9.html" target="_blank"&gt;Woman critical after shooting at American Legion post in Parkland early Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/woman-dies-after-shooting-outside-fast-food-restaurant-in-downtown-louisville-near-nulu/article_977afb3b-b61e-4c1c-9330-23d38632bd56.html" target="_blank"&gt;Woman dies after shooting outside fast food restaurant in downtown Louisville near NuLu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/contract-details-reveal-when-kentucky-could-seek-repayment-from-blueoval-sk/article_08b61010-b9a6-4b95-aa0a-d26b4948e52d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Contract details reveal when Kentucky could seek repayment from BlueOval SK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/federal-judge-dismisses-consent-decree-meant-to-spark-police-reform-in-louisville/article_1894e619-0355-4d5a-bafb-f0ecb97519cc.html" target="_blank"&gt;Federal judge dismisses consent decree meant to spark police reform in Louisville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/dozens-of-vacancies-raise-safety-concerns-at-louisville-metro-corrections/article_e7da36c1-ad09-434d-97be-991f733bad68.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dozens of vacancies raise safety concerns at Louisville Metro Corrections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/louisville-doctors-urge-prevention-as-flu-cases-surge-after-the-holidays/article_32d375de-5ee1-4f3d-a6bb-75cf6bb7658d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Louisville doctors urge prevention as flu cases surge after the holidays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/lmpd-detective-shared-login-to-flock-camera-system-with-dea-agent-conducting-immigration-search/article_03cc732a-3f04-444e-9eee-ad4d2f5dc848.html" target="_blank"&gt;LMPD detective shared login to Flock camera system with DEA agent conducting immigration search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copyright 2026 WDRB Media.

                                &lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Kentucky health officials are warning the public of possible measles exposures in northern Kentucky earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post on the Kentucky Department for Public Health's Facebook page said it "identified potential measles exposures in Grant County." According to the post, the exposure was traced to "an unvaccinated, out-of-state traveler" who stayed at the Holiday Inn &amp;amp; Suites in Dry Ridge from Dec. 28-30." That person also visited the Ark Encounter on Dec. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, can cause serious health problems, especially in young children, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC's website&lt;/a&gt;. The virus spreads through the air after someone infected coughs or sneezes. It can then linger for up to two hours after the infected person leaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can also be spread if someone touches surfaces that an infected person has touched. Symptoms include a cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by white spots that appear on the face and down the body.
