During my senior year of college in 1997, I ate a sweet potato for dinner every night. I turned down dinners out with friends, fearing a deviation from my “safe,” healthy meal.

López-Gil’s work emphasizes the need for standardized diagnostic criteria for the condition. “More research is needed, but that doesn’t mean [orthorexia] isn’t a real and significant condition,” says López-Gil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="J7EV2WJWLBHIZOUXL7EZF5AWLA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="J7EV2WJWLBHIZOUXL7EZF5AWLA"&gt;Social media connection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AVFORB7Z6RDLLKILYUCRSUH3LE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts say social media plays a role in perpetuating orthorexia, although the extent is unclear. “It’s hard to tell if there’s an uptick in orthorexia because we’re better at recognizing it, or because of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10032524/" target="_blank"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wildes. “Most likely, it’s both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KLFSV2MUOZDQTJFX4OYWIOTOF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;López-Gil says &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666323000752#bib38" target="_blank"&gt;higher social media use&lt;/a&gt; correlates with increased orthorexia symptoms, particularly within online “clean eating” communities. He also pointed to post-pandemic shifts in eating habits, increased screen time and heightened health anxieties as contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QJZ3RRPRH5AR7F4OZGMXNASDIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There’s always been a relationship between media consumption and perceptions of your body or eating behaviors,” says &lt;a href="http://newhouse.syracuse.edu/people/makana-chock" target="_blank"&gt;T.

Alperovitz, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.mcleanhospital.org/treatment/klarman" target="_blank"&gt;Klarman Eating Disorders Center&lt;/a&gt; at McLean Hospital. “People gravitate toward things they can control when they feel anxious, and food and diet, as well as weight, body shape and size, are quantifiable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HXXS4F3AZFF4PEI7SGHA53TQRY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unlike those with anorexia nervosa, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666323000764" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that individuals with orthorexia typically don’t struggle with perceived weight or body shape.

Marshall adds that the high &lt;a href="https://anad.org/eating-disorder-statistic/" target="_blank"&gt;mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; associated with eating disorders calls for increased attention and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="PMJTZ7LHWRFMDAONYDVRZS2MLY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="PMJTZ7LHWRFMDAONYDVRZS2MLY"&gt;Getting help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PSN2N3APB5CGNPSSWEMK3LSSRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts offer the following advice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMNUVM5HBNHJLIY6HRRUKP7LRE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t wait to get help:&lt;/b&gt; Marshall suggests starting with the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/screening-tool/" target="_blank"&gt;NEDA screening tool&lt;/a&gt;, which was used 110,000 times last year and has been used more than a million times since its inception. &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/find-treatment/" target="_blank"&gt;NEDA offers a list of resources&lt;/a&gt; for specialists in every state.

Sam, a 45-year-old nurse, had already seen Cora Perkins survive two types of cancer. During previous appointments, she had found Cora’s arms turning blue from diabetes, or her ankles swollen from congestive heart failure, or her stomach cramping from hunger with no fresh food left in the house. It had been a week since Sam’s last visit, and she wondered if anyone had come or gone through the front door since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She knocked, but nobody answered. She walked across the porch to a hole in the window and called into the house. “Cora, honey? Are you OK?” A light flickered inside. A dog began to bark. Sam pushed open the door and walked into the living room, where she found Cora wrapped under a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Sam. Thank God you’re here,” said Cora, 64. She tried to stand, but she lost her balance and sat back down in a recliner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It looks like you’re wobbly this morning,” Sam said. “Are you feeling really bad or just normal bad?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It was the same question she asked her patients dozens of times each week as she made home visits across West Virginia, traveling from one impending emergency to the next in a country where feeling bad had become the new normal. All 31 patients in her caseload for the Williamson Health and Wellness Center were under 65 years old, and yet each had at least one of the chronic diseases that had become endemic in the United States over the last two decades: death rates up 25 percent nationally from diabetes, 40 percent from liver disease, 60 percent from kidney disease, 80 percent from hypertension and more than 95 percent from obesity, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

			&lt;p&gt;A new study charts in detail the relationship &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;between physical activity and dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, with significant drops in risk requiring less of a physical workout than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from Johns Hopkins University in the US found that up to 35 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise every week is associated with a 41 percent drop in dementia risk, compared to those who didn't exercise at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other encouraging findings too: even the oldest among us can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; by increasing our weekly activity, and even just a few minutes of exercise a week can have protective effects for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153011" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1.jpg" alt="Dementia chart" class="wp-image-153011 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1.jpg 2772w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-642x363.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-734x415.jpg 734w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-768x434.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-1536x869.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-2048x1158.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-600x339.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2772px) 100vw, 2772px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153011" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers compared dementia cases against activity levels. (Wanigatunga et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that increasing physical activity, even as little as five minutes per day, can reduce dementia risk in older adults," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Amal Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data on 89,667 adults, with a median age of 63, across an average of 4.4 years. Data was logged using dedicated activity trackers worn on the wrist, which logged movement over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By also recording which participants went on to develop dementia, the researchers could link activity with dementia risk. Compared to those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-what-happens-if-you-dont-exercise-until-the-weekend"&gt;did no exercise&lt;/a&gt; at all, dementia risk was 60 percent lower for those who did 36–70 minutes of physical activity per week, and 63 percent lower in the 71–140 minutes category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who banked 140 minutes or more of physical activity per week, dementia risk was reduced by 69 percent. With so many potential factors at play, from diet to genetics, this doesn't prove direct cause and effect – but it does suggest exercise and brain health are closely linked (as we've seen in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-training-reduces-dementia-risk-by-almost-30-10-year-study-finds-speed-cognitive"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations remained more or less the same for participants classed as frail. The researchers are keen to stress that anyone at any stage of life can get the benefits from almost any level of additional exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that even frail or nearly frail older adults might be able to reduce their dementia risk through low-dose exercise," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you feel like you're not exercising as much as you should be, bear in mind that it's never too late to start. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercising-in-midlife-may-reverse-years-of-inactivity-large-study-finds"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that upping the amount of time you spend on the move and working out can help to reverse years of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research will be needed to explore why this association exists, but it makes sense that a healthier body means a healthier brain. Exercise &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-exercise-is-linked-to-larger-brain-volume-in-memory-and-learning-regions"&gt;has been shown&lt;/a&gt; to increase the size of areas of the brain associated with learning and remembering, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This adds to a growing body of evidence that some exercise is better than nothing, especially with regard to an aging-related disorder that affects the brain that currently has no cure," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;American Medical Directors Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/whole-foods-ramadan-cake/"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; officially starting, throngs of participants in the month-long food abstinence-a-thon will gobble up dates. Well, between the hours of sunset and sundown. But rather, as per Prophet Muhammad’s tradition, a trio of the fruits when the day’s fasting is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date producers &lt;a href="https://www.producebluebook.com/2025/01/24/natural-delights-prepares-retailers-for-ramadan-dates/#:~:text=Last%20Ramadan%2C%20average%20weekly%20Medjool,and%20traditions%20across%20the%20country."&gt;experience massive sales upticks&lt;/a&gt; during the Holy Month as the food has long been synonymous with it. However, TikToker Kirti Tewani (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirtitewani"&gt;@kirtitewani&lt;/a&gt;) recently posted a viral TikTok that may give even the most famished faster pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a viral clip that’s accrued over 4.9 million views, she urges folks to take their dates apart. This way, they can check for any sneaky bits of mold that may be hiding inside the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folks who watched her clip were stunned to see just how recessed these bits of mold were. This led a slew of people to worry that they’ve been chowing down on fungus filled dates for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-open-it-up"&gt;Open it up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is your reminder to always open your dates and look inside. And check properly,” Tewani says. She demonstrates her suggestion on camera throughout her narration. The TikToker peels a dried date fruit apart in front of the camera. Next, she splits it open and pushes the exterior, fleshy part of the date inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the whitish internals of the dried date pop outwards. Its upper portion is flecked with what appears to be black mold, which the TikToker is quick to point out. “Because sometimes you’re gonna find this mold and fungus,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally troubling, Tewani claims, is that these spores can form even when dried dates are properly sealed and packaged. In order to quell any alarmist thoughts, however, she offered an addendum to her PSA. And it’s that just because one date in a box has mold in it, doesn’t mean the entire assortment is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To exhibit this assertion, she then takes another date from her container. “Not all dates are gonna be like that so let’s check this one,” she states. Following this, she cracks open the fruit right up into the lens. Unlike the previous example, this one is completely devoid of mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-mold"&gt;Why mold?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most produce, dates are prone to getting moldy. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.narafood.de/en/blogs/news/dates-mold#:~:text=The%20juicier%20the%20dates%2C%20the,stored%20in%20a%20dry%20place."&gt;Nara Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.narafood.de/en/blogs/news/dates-mold#:~:text=The%20juicier%20the%20dates%2C%20the,stored%20in%20a%20dry%20place."&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that dates are extremely persistent fruits “that have a particularly long shelf life. So much so that “some varieties even keep for several years!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company goes on to state that fresh dates are best kept refrigerated. Conversely, dried dates must be stored “in a cool dry place.” This is especially true of varieties that are exceedingly juicy—keeping them cool is paramount to prevent spoilage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, sealing fresh dates in air-tight containers will create the perfect environment for mold growth. This is due to the fruit’s moisture content having nowhere to “breathe” except in a tight, closed-off space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to dry dates, arid places are best. Steering them clear of any potential condensation build-up or moisture will minimize the chances of mold build-up. What helps to make storing dry dates an easier task is the fruits’ response to “temperature fluctuations.” &lt;em&gt;Nara&lt;/em&gt; indicates that dried dates “tolerate” such environmental aberrations “relatively well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="https://www.thebedouinway.com/bedouin-blog/2015/11/14/palm-trees-dates-the-south-sinai-bedouin"&gt;desert Bedouins were able to sustain themselves on these fruits&lt;/a&gt; since 4,000 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirtitewani/video/7465728303773830446" data-video-id="7465728303773830446"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-are-horrified"&gt;Viewers are horrified&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One viewer was quick to make a punny remark involving the name of the fruit. “I only do that after the third date,” they said, reacting to the way Temani pulled apart the date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, numerous others seemed horrified to learn this news. Due to how well-hidden the mold is in Temani’s dates, one TikToker arrived at a revolting conclusion. “I never thought to do that. I wonder how many moldy ones I’ve eaten,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by someone else: “I’ve definitely eaten moldy dates I have never checked.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This potential fungi-filled date eater was exceedingly detailed. “Oh wow that’s crazy. I had dates one time that released a puff of dust when I bit into them. Maybe that was mold. Idk I just kept eating,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Dot has reached out to Temani via TikTok comment for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Of the several factors that increase the risk of the disease there are a few that can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, in a podcast Dr Tarang Krishna spoke about the lifestyle habits that we must adopt to be cancer free. He spoke about MEDSRX. "This is an acronym, which if followed diligently can safeguard you from cancer," he said in the podcast Figuring Out with Raj Shamani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does MEDSRX stand for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;M stands for meditation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress weakens the immune system and increases inflammation, both of which can contribute to cancer development. Meditation helps manage stress by reducing cortisol levels and promoting relaxation. Mindfulness meditation, deep breathing, and guided visualization have been shown to lower inflammation markers and support cellular health. Additionally, meditation enhances mental well-being, helping individuals adopt healthier lifestyle choices that further reduce cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;E stands for exercise&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise has been associated with a reduced risk of various cancers, such as breast, colon, and lung cancer. Exercise aids in the regulation of hormones such as insulin and estrogen, which, when out of balance, can fuel cancer development. Exercise also boosts the immune system, decreases chronic inflammation, and improves blood circulation to facilitate effective elimination of toxins and damaged cells from the body. At least 150 minutes per week of brisk walking, cycling, or swimming is recommended to provide maximum prevention of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;D stands for diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced diet plays a crucial role in cancer prevention. Consuming antioxidant-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, helps neutralize harmful free radicals that can damage cells and trigger cancerous changes. A plant-based diet rich in fiber supports gut health, which is vital for overall immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cancer-fighting foods include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage) that contain compounds like sulforaphane, known for their anti-cancer properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries rich in antioxidants and vitamins that combat oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric with curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory compound.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea, which contains polyphenols that inhibit cancer cell growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, seeds, and olive oil, which reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding processed foods, excess sugar, and red meat can further lower cancer risk by reducing inflammation and promoting cellular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;S stands for sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep is essential for the body’s ability to repair DNA and regulate hormone levels. Poor sleep disrupts melatonin production, a hormone with anti-cancer properties, and increases inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which are linked to higher cancer risk. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night to allow the body to detoxify, repair damaged cells, and maintain a strong immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;R stands for relationship&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong social connections and healthy relationships play a significant role in cancer prevention. Studies suggest that individuals with strong emotional support from family, friends, or community groups experience lower levels of stress, reduced inflammation, and improved immune function. Positive relationships also encourage healthier lifestyle choices, reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as smoking, excessive drinking, or poor dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;X stands for X-factor that you enjoy doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X represents the X-factor—any activity that brings you joy, purpose, and fulfillment. Engaging in hobbies like music, painting, gardening, or sports reduces stress, boosts immunity, and enhances mental well-being, all of which are crucial for cancer prevention. Enjoyable activities lower cortisol levels, decrease inflammation, and promote positive lifestyle habits. Whether it's dancing, playing an instrument, or volunteering, doing what you love improves emotional resilience and supports overall health. Cultivating your X-factor is not just about happiness—it’s a powerful tool in maintaining wellness and reducing cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 04:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwJBVV95cUxOVGJNcFppOGdDaWwtVXc5aVpxM2JVU3BKYkhMVjFzcU9nV2FPc3NWU1MyYU92dHYtRGo4UHVSMHJJNElHZlJjWDVTaDhEYlVtNWU4dmZyX3VjWVFaZE9ROHROMWdtdEJXcV80R1V5eEpSNEh6QnFWYWk2ek1QQm44cWlYOU5EbW4zUXBwczlFNkVWY0oxbGhLNDNiMzFraExzdVhPVm5wMkU0NE5HQWIxV0htRXFoWFpVRjFwRG5JYWN0YTRIV1JWR0U5ZGU2d0lyQm9sbzV1N3FXQkMzMWRpelhJeEpuNU8zT0tRU01oUnVNM1R1R1dXb0ZuTDNhaWl2MWhB</guid></item><item><title>People Are Sharing The Most Overlooked Kinds Of Pain, And It's Important We Pay Attention - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQeVkwYTlvQkpId3kwc2VVb0I0RlRNYnBDN0VaaEZJMksxWjlaVUpyT0k3X3gybmwxSk1xVjN1RExPamVEWlFfYXRsMzFqcERZVEI5T05MeWh0MzNmc3NRcFhFTmlZd3c5c2RrREtpSFBoa1A1UTRuckdER2l4MVFRanpVM2lHcHMwTWZrLU1maTFpZDVKeExaelNtckc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="headerCta__1XoKe"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Newsletters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best of the internet, delivered straight to your inbox!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BuzzFeed</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 00:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQeVkwYTlvQkpId3kwc2VVb0I0RlRNYnBDN0VaaEZJMksxWjlaVUpyT0k3X3gybmwxSk1xVjN1RExPamVEWlFfYXRsMzFqcERZVEI5T05MeWh0MzNmc3NRcFhFTmlZd3c5c2RrREtpSFBoa1A1UTRuckdER2l4MVFRanpVM2lHcHMwTWZrLU1maTFpZDVKeExaelNtckc</guid></item><item><title>National Bird Flu Outbreak Kills Sandhill Cranes - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5RWGlhRUtJV3NOTHM3dG5WOVVuNFJPQnI3bnhYSFpLWjVyRmt5Z0doaWRDRUdBdDgxV1E1MHhCR1Q5NkZEbjJuQ1NycWdQSGY0ZUZNZ1hxWVQ4U2M1bDR4NFdLMXpXeHpWMk9SZ0hUYW5mWUNIS0Qyck1wNNIBgAFBVV95cUxObEg1VURRZXBOVGtkQ0FOcmc0ZDdRbkQ0cUpTcUw1SHkyNEt0aDJmbVBDSWJvVHZESVV0SG9MMlh3Zi00V3llX1JqUW02Vi1Rd3pKVUdnXzVfTDl1STV3ZFBjTWsycTRoazNlOE5SWFI3UTNKVlQ0RUQyT0NQR1BEOQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Birding enthusiasts in Indiana have been struck by the loss of an estimated 1,500 Sandhill Cranes. The deaths of the popular birds has been attributed to Avian Influenza, or bird flu, by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cranes congregate in several areas of the state including west of South Bend, Indiana where they have access to open water and food. Some winter in the area along with isolated areas of Southern Michigan instead of migrating south for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indiana DNR's Marty Benson said in a short message to Newsmax that the &lt;br&gt;
total number of stricken cranes is not known. The department estimates 1,500 in total, with at least 100 in an area surrounding the frozen Fish Lake in the Northwest corner of the state. He pointed to a department press &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/avian-influenza-detected-in-waterfowl-in-multiple-indiana-counties" target="_blank"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; in January that indicated widespread incidents of bird flu detected in wild birds throughout a ten-county area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benson said, "Since 2022, there have been more than 125 positive detections of HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) in waterfowl across the state." The death count of afflicted Sandhill Cranes from this most recent event may be higher as wildlife biologists continue to survey the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandhill Cranes are &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/sandhill-crane" target="_blank"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; with birding enthusiasts. When flying, their calls can sometimes be heard from a mile or more away. Many communities hold events to bring attention to areas where they congregate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Michigan, the State Department of Natural Resources &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/about/newsroom/releases/2025/02/11/dnr-suspects-bird-flu-in-recent-lower-michigan-waterfowl-die-offs" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the recent deaths of at least 300 wild birds including Canada Geese across a five county area of the state's Southern Lower Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian Influenza is considered a primary &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;factor&lt;/a&gt; in the deaths and euthanization of millions of egg-laying chickens and the subsequent increase in retail egg prices throughout America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In 2023, neurologists at a memory clinic in China diagnosed a 19-year-old with what they believed to be  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153739" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease&lt;span&gt;, making him the youngest person ever to be diagnosed with the condition in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male teenager began experiencing memory decline around age 17, and the cognitive losses only worsened over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaging of the patient's brain showed shrinkage in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, and his cerebrospinal fluid hinted at common markers of this most common form of dementia&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often thought of as an old person's ailment, and yet early-onset cases, which include patients under the age of 65, account for up to 10 percent of all diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_136965" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136965" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-642x260.jpg" alt="older woman in a care home" class="wp-image-136965 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-136965" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is today an incredibly common disease among older people, but it's comparatively rare in the young. (zeljkosantrac/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all patients under 30 years of age can have their Alzheimer's explained by pathological gene mutations, putting them into the category of familial Alzheimer's disease (&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/early-onset-familial-ad/overview/what-early-onset-familial-alzheimer-disease-efad"&gt;FAD&lt;/a&gt;). The younger a person is when they receive a diagnosis, the more likely it is the result of a faulty gene they've inherited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet researchers at the Capital Medical University in Beijing couldn't find any of the usual mutations responsible for the early onset of memory loss, nor any suspect genes when they performed a genome-wide search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this diagnosis in China, &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/34366350"&gt;the youngest patient with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; was 21 years old. They carried the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/psen1/"&gt;PSEN1 gene mutation&lt;/a&gt;, which causes abnormal proteins to build up in the brain, forming clumps of toxic plaques, a common feature of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases like the one in China pose something of a mystery. None of the 19-year-old's family had a history of Alzheimer's or dementia, making it hard to categorize as FAD, yet the teenager had no other diseases, infections, or head trauma that could explain his sudden cognitive decline either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years before being referred to the memory clinic, the teenage patient began struggling to focus in class. Reading also became difficult and his short-term memory declined. Oftentimes, he couldn't remember events from the day before, and he was always misplacing his belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_89131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89131" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-642x260.jpg" alt="Depressive Symptoms And Memory Loss in Older Adults Linked to Telomere Shortening" class="wp-image-89131 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-89131" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Patients over 65 account for the vast majority of AD cases. (Maskot/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the cognitive decline became so bad, the young man was unable to finish high school, although he could still live independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after being referred to the memory clinic, he showed losses in immediate recall, short-delay recall after three minutes, and long-delay recall after 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient's full-scale memory score was 82 percent lower than that of peers his own age, while his immediate memory score was 87 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term follow-up is needed to support the young man's diagnosis, but his medical team &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time the patient was "altering our understanding of the typical age of onset of AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The patient had very early-onset AD with no clear pathogenic mutations," &lt;span&gt;neurologist Jianping Jia and colleagues &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065"&gt;wrote in their study&lt;/a&gt;, "which suggests that its pathogenesis still needs to be explored."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case study, published in February 2023, just goes to show that Alzheimer's doesn't follow a single pathway, and is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-says"&gt;much more complex&lt;/a&gt; than we thought, emerging &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-splits-alzheimer-s-into-three-subtypes-and-it-might-help-us-treat-it-better"&gt;via numerous avenues&lt;/a&gt; with varying effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3209607/chinese-diagnosis-worlds-youngest-person-probable-alzheimers-set-change-thinking-about-disease?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article&amp;amp;campaign=3209607"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to the South China Morning Post, the neurologists who described the patient's case argued that future studies should focus on early-onset cases to further improve our understanding of memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exploring the mysteries of young people with Alzheimer's disease may become one of the most challenging scientific questions of the future," they &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3209607/chinese-diagnosis-worlds-youngest-person-probable-alzheimers-set-change-thinking-about-disease?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article&amp;amp;campaign=3209607"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in February 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The outbreak continues to be mainly in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a press briefing hosted by the city of Lubbock, Texas, on Friday, Ron Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, offered a stark warning for Texans in his opening statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What I want you to hear is: It's not good to go have measles parties because what may happen is—we can't predict who's going to do poorly with measles, be hospitalized, potentially get pneumonia or encephalitis and or pass away from this,” Cook said. “So that's a foolish idea to go have a measles party. The best thing to do is make sure that you're well vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Lubbock sits about 90 miles northwest of the outbreak's epicenter &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/"&gt;in Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the state's least vaccinated counties. It has recorded 98 of the outbreak's 146 cases. While Lubbock has only reported two of the 146 cases, patients from elsewhere have been treated in Lubbock. That includes the first two cases in the outbreak as well as the child who died of the infection earlier this week, who was not a resident of Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It's unclear if any measles parties are occurring in Gaines or elsewhere. “It's mostly been ... social media talk,” Cook said in response to a follow-up question from Ars. He noted that measles parties and chickenpox parties were more common practices decades ago, before vaccines for both diseases were available. But he again warned about the dangers today. “Please don't do that. It's just foolishness; it's playing roulette,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cook, along with Lubbock's director of public health, Katherine Wells, said they see no end in sight for the outbreak, which now spans nine counties in Texas, many of which have low vaccination rates. “This outbreak is going to continue to grow,” Wells said, declining to forecast how high the final case count could go after a reporter raised the possibility of several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So far, 116 of the 146 cases are under the age of 18, with 46 being 4 or under. Only five of the 146 were vaccinated with at least one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On a more positive note, Wells reported that the outbreak has seemed to sway some vaccine-hesitant parents to get their children vaccinated. Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. “Which is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So far in the outbreak, which erupted in late January, messaging about the disease and the importance of vaccination has exclusively come from state and local authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;a brief statement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday, which was not sent through the agency's press distribution list. It did, however, note that “vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;During a cabinet meeting Wednesday, US health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, offering a variety of inaccurate information. Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, falsely claiming that “it's not unusual.” Actually, this is an unusual year for measles in the US. As epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted on Bluesky, the number of US measles cases this year has already &lt;a data-offer-url="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h"}' href="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;surpassed the total case counts from eight of the previous 15 years&lt;/a&gt;.

Last year, there were 16. It is not unusual.

The measles had been declared eliminated in America in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;State officials said that the child who died in Texas was “school-aged” and unvaccinated. The last-known previous death from measles was in 2015, when an immunocompromised adult woman &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/woman-dies-measles-first-us-death-12-years-n385946" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:succumbed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;succumbed&lt;/a&gt; to the disease.

&lt;p&gt;Taters and toast could be tooth trouble in disguise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/13/2/461" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the number of AMY1 gene copies you have plays a crucial role in how the bacteria in your mouth respond to starch, potentially increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease for some people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most people have been warned that if you eat a bunch of sugar, make sure you brush your teeth,” &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/02/do-starchy-carbs-cause-cavities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Angela Poole&lt;/a&gt;, senior author and assistant professor of molecular nutrition at Cornell University. “The takeaway finding here is that depending on your AMY1 copy number, you may want to be just as vigilant about brushing your teeth after eating those digestible starches.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The findings could pave the way to more personalized dental care.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;RomanR – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Poor oral health can wreck havoc throughout the body.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kay Abrahams/peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMY1 gene is responsible for producing salivary amylase, an enzyme that helps digest starch in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have linked AMY1 to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/21/new-treatment-for-cavities-is-easier-more-effective-study/"&gt;cavities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/02/cutting-daily-calories-could-help-reduce-gum-disease-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, scientists haven’t fully understood how salivary amylase interacts with starch to disrupt the oral microbiome and increase the odds of dental disaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s what we wanted to know in this experiment. What’s going on in the mouth if someone eats starch, and is the answer different if their copy number is high or it’s low?” Poole said. “What we found was that there are other bacteria involved in these processes and that the changes depended on AMY1.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected saliva samples from 31 adults, each with different AMY1 copy numbers. They then added starch to the cultured samples, or biofilms, and observed how the bacterial makeup shifted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In samples with high AMY1 numbers, the team found that starch significantly reduced the proportions of two bacteria — Atopobium and Veillonella — while Streptococcus levels increased. All three bacteria are associated with tooth decay or gum disease, according to Poole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some increased and some decreased, so it’s not so straightforward as saying, ‘The whole thing is good or bad,’” Poole said. “It’s an interaction, but it looks like the AMY1 copy number, as well as which species are present in people’s mouths when they eat starch, is affecting the risk for developing these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Your body breaks down starchy foods into glucose, which fuels all tissues and organs with the energy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;M.studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study findings don’t mean you should ditch starch from your diet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most people, starchy foods are a important source of carbohydrates and play a vital role in a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/starchy-foods"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; when eaten in moderation. They provide energy and fiber, along with essential vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/high-starch-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Starch-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include bread, cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, beans, corn and even bananas. People with higher AMY1 copies &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/10/18/did-eating-starchy-foods-give-humans-an-evolutionary-advantage--.html#:~:text=People%20with%20more%20copies%20of,pasta%2C%20but%20not%20sugary%20foods." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have an easier time breaking down starchy foods&lt;/a&gt; — a genetic variation that researchers believe evolved in certain groups over time.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The populations that historically had greater access to starch tend to have more copies,” Poole said, “which makes sense from a practical standpoint, because it would have given you a survival advantage when food is scarce, to be able to break down those starches more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this may have its benefits, Poole said the study also points to potential downsides for your teeth and gums. “If someone has a high copy number, they break down starch efficiently, and bacteria that like those sugars are going to grow more in that person’s mouth,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research could open the door to more personalized dental care. By understanding your genetic makeup, dentists might one day offer recommendations tailored to your individual risks when it comes to starch metabolism and oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result? A happier mouth and a healthier you. After all, tooth decay and gum disease don’t just mess with your smile or make eating and talking a challenge — they can affect your entire well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor oral health has been &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-dental-health-affects-overall-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;linked to a range of serious conditions&lt;/a&gt;, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and certain cancers. Experts believe the issue lies with bacteria from the mouth entering the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that spreads throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/how-dental-health-and-mental-health-are-connected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dental and mental health are closely connected as well&lt;/a&gt;. Struggling with issues like gum disease or tooth decay can trigger feelings of embarrassment, low self-esteem, and anxiety, often leading to social isolation and a decline in overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cat in New Jersey was euthanized after becoming severely ill from a confirmed case of &lt;a href="https://6abc.com/tag/bird-flu/" data-testid="prism-linkbase"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s health department said Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cat was not exposed to infected poultry, livestock, raw milk or meat.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was allowed to roam outdoors, so it’s not known if it had exposure to wild birds or other animals.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other cats on the property in Hunterdon County are also ill.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 100 domestic cats have been infected with bird flu since 2022 across the country, according to the USDA’s latest figures. Thirty-five of those infections occurred in just the past two months this year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No human cases have been linked to exposure to infected cats.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Health Department is recommending the following steps to protect pets:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Do not feed cats raw (unpasteurized) milk or dairy products, and avoid feeding any raw or undercooked meat treats or diets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Keep cats indoors to prevent exposure to birds and other wildlife.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Keep cats away from livestock, poultry, and their environments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Avoid contact with sick or dead birds and other wildlife yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Thoroughly wash your hands after handling your cat and after any encounters with poultry, livestock, or wild birds and other animals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Change your clothes and shoes, and thoroughly wash any exposed skin, after interacting with sick or dead animals that may harbor the H5N1 virus, and before interacting with your cat.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Contact a veterinarian if you notice signs of H5 HPAI or think your cat might have been exposed to the virus.

The tropical fruit has long been a staple in traditional medicine across Central and South America, known for its supposed antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and even anticancer properties. But are all these purported benefits of the fruit backed by science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's understand the nutrition factor first. The fruit despite its rough and tough appearance has a brilliant taste and many compare it to strawberry and banana. A cup of soursop fruit has 148 calories, 7.42 g of fibre, 37.8 g of carbohydrates, and 30.5 g of sugar. Being a low glycemic index, it's great for people with diabetes. The fruit is abundant in vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, as well as antioxidants, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native to Central and Southern America, soursop has been used in traditional medicine to manage diabetes, treat infections and even cancers. The soursop fruit or leaves have also been used to treat stomach ailments, fever, parasitic infections, hypertension and rheumatism. Many claims say soursop tea or extract can slow the spread of cancer, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support this claim. Only limited, lab-based research has pointed to the fruit's ability to fight cancer, however, the same hasn't been studied in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is soursop effective in killing cancer cells? What the research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry found the soursop compounds could destroy the breast cancer cells and were even more effective than chemotherapy. Another study published in 2016 in Scientific Reports found that soursop had anticancer activity on prostate cancer cells. However, the study was done on mice, and not humans. A 2024 review paper found that soursop extracts show promise in fighting cancer, with compounds that kill cancer cells while sparing healthy ones. The review also highlighted anti-inflammatory benefits, suggesting that soursop’s long-standing use in traditional medicine may have some scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists find that certain bioactive compounds like acetogenins, alkaloids, flavonoids and vitamins in the fruit have been found to be effective in killing cancer cells. These acetogenins have also been linked with not just blocking cancer growth but cancer prevention. A key acetogenin, annonacin, has also been linked to Parkinson's and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can soursop raise risk of neurodegenerative disorders?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in the journal Molecules warned that high doses of acetogenins, found in soursop, could be neurotoxic and may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. Some of the fruit’s alkaloids may also affect nerve cells, especially with prolonged or excessive consumption. Researchers emphasized the need for further studies and clinical trials to fully understand soursop’s safety and medicinal potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of soursop&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High in antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet and delicious fruit can also deliver a wealth of antioxidants to your body, which have disease-fighting potential.

However, the NHS has warned that some people may have adverse reactions to the medication. The health agency advised such individuals to seek alternative pain relief options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Anything from rashes, redness, or itching can be an indication of the body’s negative response to the drug. Wheezing or difficulty breathing, on the other hand, could signal a severe allergic reaction, particularly in individuals with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has experienced these three symptoms after taking ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or naproxen, is advised to stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

                    &lt;p&gt;DALLAS (AP) — The number of people with measles in Texas increased to 146 in an outbreak that led this week to the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases — Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years — increased by 22 since Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said cases span over nine counties in Texas, including almost 100 in Gaines County, and 20 patients have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-highly-contagious-measles-and-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child who died Tuesday night in the outbreak is the first U.S. death from the highly contagious but preventable respiratory disease since 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The child was treated at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, though the facility said the patient didn’t live in Lubbock County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services was watching cases but dismissed the outbreak as “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Friday afternoon, Kennedy said in a post on X that his heart went out to families impacted by the outbreak, and he recognized “the serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and healthcare workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy went on to say in the post that his agency will continue to fund Texas’ immunization program and that ending the outbreak is a “top priority” for him and his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has largely spread through rural, oil rig-dotted West Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14 percent skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. Anton has said the number of unvaccinated kids in Gaines County is likely significantly higher because homeschooled children’s data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/west-texas-measles-outbreak-spreads-amid-vaccine-hesitancy-in-some-communities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; West Texas measles outbreak spreads amid vaccine hesitancy in some communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95 percent vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had considered measles, a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours, eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern New Mexico has nine cases of measles currently, but the state health department said there is no connection to the outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference Friday in Austin, officials confirmed the first reported case in Travis County since 2019. Dr. Desmar Walkes of the Austin-Travis County Health Authority said the case involved an unvaccinated infant who was exposed to the virus during a vacation overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services spokesman Chris Van Deusen said the case was one of four linked to international travel so far this year, none of which were part of the West Texas outbreak. The others were two in Houston last month and one reported this week in Rockwall County, east of Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Travis County case, the child’s family members were vaccinated and were isolating at home and no exposures were expected, Walkes said. She could not give the exact age of the infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the news conference urged people to get vaccinated if they are not already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re here to say quite simply: Measles can kill, ignorance can kill and vaccine denial definitely kills,” said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School officials in two Texas cities each reported reported one rubella case this week, but Van Deusen said no infections had been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

            Authorities investigating the deaths of at least 60 people in northwestern Congo suspect the water source in one of the areas may have been contaminated, the World Health Organization said Friday. But the agency said it’s too early for any definitive conclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00033b6mn4nzgezd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors are investigating more than 1,000 &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-disease-equateur-outbreak-9bd3dc848d3c1ae6196f1d194f56f7bd" target="_blank"&gt;illnesses&lt;/a&gt; that emerged since late January in five villages in Congo’s Equateur province, where high rates of malaria have complicated efforts to diagnose the cases and where officials have said they’ve been unable so far to confirm the main cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00043b6m2mjy9njd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said during an online briefing Friday that for one of the villages there is “a very strong level of suspicion of a poisoning event related to the poisoning of a water source.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00053b6m0t6zpprq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ryan did not clarify whether he was referring to contamination by accident, negligence or deliberate action. He also did not identify the village where the poisoning was suspected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8xfn00013b6mvwflkbic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will not stop investigating until we are sure that the true cause or the absolute cause of what is occurring here is fully investigated,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00063b6muwpccet2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Illnesses were first detected in late January in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00073b6mjeutq9ek@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twelve cases and eight deaths in total have been recorded in Boloko, with no new cases recorded since January, officials say, adding that nearly half of deaths there occurred within hours of the onset of symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00083b6mx12d1ac3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The village of Bomate in Basankusu health zone, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Boloko, has been hit the most: 98% of the cases and 86% of deaths have been recorded there, health officials say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00093b6m74lz1so1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO said on Thursday that hundreds of the patients have tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. In addition to common malaria symptoms such as fever and body aches, patients have also shown symptoms like chills, sweating, stiff neck, runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000a3b6m781nzzr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The health crisis has caused fear among residents, some of whom have said they fled the villages to avoid falling sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000b3b6mctuj5oyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say access to the sick has been hindered by the remote locations of the affected villages and that several people died before medical teams were able to reach them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000e3b6m0dc4rpvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Clearly, at the centre of this, we have some kind of poisoning event,” Ryan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8ykv000f3b6mhc0np41b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another likely suspect could be a “toxic-type event either from a biological perspective like meningitis or from a chemical exposure,” the WHO emergencies chief said, citing systematic investigations carried out so far by experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8ykv000g3b6mfuvxujdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials, though, haven’t been able to confirm the main cause of the illnesses, he said, adding that the high rates of malaria and other common illnesses in the villages are making it difficult to determine the cause.

Paracetamol or Acetaminophen, perhaps the only painkiller allowed to expecting mothers, has now come under scrutiny, after a study published in Nature Mental Health, linked its use during pregnancy to an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It can affect academic performance, relationships, and overall daily functioning. If left untreated, ADHD may lead to low self-esteem and social difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Paracetamol's safety record in pregnancy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol is commonly used to treat mild to moderate pain, fever, headache, and muscular pain. Acetaminophen has shown a relatively low risk of causing birth defects or pregnancy complications when used appropriately. Some painkillers, particularly NSAIDs, can affect uterine contractions and potentially increase the risk of preterm labor or prolonged labor. Acetaminophen does not have this effect. However, this new study raises fresh concerns about the use of paracetamol during pregnancy and suggests there may be some overlooked risks to early brain development of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Findings of the study&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the bloodstream levels of acetaminophen in 307 Black women during their pregnancy, were tracked by researchers in the US. It was found that the children of expecting mothers who used acetaminophen were more than three times likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Son vs daughter: Who's more at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, for daughters, exposure to acetaminophen in the womb was associated with more than six-fold increase in the risk of ADHD within the first ten years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However alarming the results of the study may sound, more conclusive evidence is needed to prove the association. It is also important to compare the benefits of the painkiller with that of the risks as its pros are more extensively studied than its long-term cons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the study is small certain factors may not have been taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study does not account for factors "like the mother's reason for taking [paracetamol], such as headaches or fevers or pains or infections, which we know are risk factors for adverse child development," statistical geneticist Viktor Ahlqvist from Sweden's Karolinska Institute, who was not involved in the current research, told Grace Wade at New Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Brennan Baker from Seattle Children's Research Institute believes it's time for the FDA to revisit acetaminophen’s safety in pregnancy. The agency last reviewed the issue in 2015, concluding there wasn’t enough evidence to link the drug to ADHD in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen," said lead author Brennan Baker, a researcher at Seattle Children's Research Institute. Baker also works in the lab of Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a UW Medicine pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This medication was also approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA," said Sathyanarayana, the paper's senior author. "Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relations to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Smoking during pregnancy may not cause ADHD in children: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 16:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Scientists describe new type of fat in human bellies - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQYllJSGg5UXUwX1V2aElmTXREbVh1RDhPUEpQWGYtTE5kbnRhS3A4THBMXzdkakY2U1hHNVN4UGdjY1BIQTNidnNzeWNmYVdBRzB1b05xT1EzcDVQeG5vbkpsSTNnMDczUGxCS25YbUZDSmJqeE13ZkhSYVdhTEFCNFhNYU5NV0V3c2hablZiWmFtV19MSUExV2ZSVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

However, one of the many aspects of obesity that have left scientists puzzled is that not all fat is created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat — fat cells that reside in the abdomen close to the internal organs — is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to a greater risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of various health problems than fat under the skin, known as subcutaneous fat. For example, excess visceral fat comes with a heightened risk of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, insulin resistance and liver disease. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies also&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest visceral fat is more "proinflammatory" than subcutaneous fat, which could potentially contribute to the ill health linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand what might be happening inside fat tissues, Yeger-Lotem and her colleagues charted a "cell atlas" of adipocytes as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body"&gt;&lt;u&gt;part of the Human Cell Atlas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a global project that aims to map all the cells in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers built this map using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA seq), which measures which genes are active and to what degree by looking at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular cousin of DNA. RNA molecules act as blueprints for proteins, shuttling instructions from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the cell's nucleus out to its protein-construction sites. By measuring RNA in the nuclei of cells extracted from fat tissue, the team gathered clues as to what each cell does inside the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeger-Lotem and colleagues examined samples of subcutaneous and visceral fat collected from 15 people during elective abdominal surgeries. Most adipocytes were fairly "classical" — meaning storing excess energy was their main purpose. But a small proportion of the fat cells were "non-classical," as their RNA suggested they carried out functions not typically associated with fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these cells were "angiogenic adipocytes," which carried proteins usually used to promote blood vessel formation; "immune-related adipocytes," which make proteins related to immune cell functions; and "extracellular matrix adipocytes," which are related to scaffold proteins that help support cells' structures. These cell subtypes, found in both visceral and subcutaneous fat, were also confirmed under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "state-of-the-art application" of snRNA seq suggests these cells may play a role in "remodeling" fat tissues, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" target="_blank" data-url="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Niklas Mejhert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of endocrinology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. Remodeling here refers to the way fat tissues change in response to weight fluctuations or metabolic changes. "Healthy" remodeling would help maintain metabolic balance, but if dysregulated, it could spur inflammation and other drivers of poor health in obesity, Mejhert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, scientists reversed type 1 diabetes by reprogramming a person's own fat cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also spotted differences in the newly described cell types depending on which tissue they were taken from. Unconventional adipocytes from visceral fat seemed more likely to communicate with the immune system than those found in skin fat, Yeger-Lotem said. This link to immune cells suggests the cell subtypes might play a role in triggering visceral fat's proinflammatory nature, which could help explain why belly fat is worse for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also hinted that the fat-tissue donors with higher insulin resistance tended to have a higher concentration of these unconventional cells in visceral fat than did people with lower insulin resistance. However, Mejhert noted that the authors did not prove causation, so it's not clear whether the cells might drive the insulin resistance in any way. It's too early to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these fat subtypes can be linked to human disease, understanding how they work could "help us fight inflammatory processes," Yeger-Lotem said. That could potentially help doctors predict the risk of insulin resistance in people with obesity, assuming all the dots connect, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berry cautioned that the study used a relatively small sample size and that, at this stage, it only suggests rather than definitively demonstrates that the fat cells have these unusual functions.

Participants who received psilocybin demonstrated substantial improvements in emotional empathy compared to the control group, which received a placebo. These improvements lasted for at least two weeks after treatment. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It can be categorized into two types: cognitive empathy (understanding another person’s perspective) and emotional empathy (feeling what others feel). While empathy is essential for forming emotional connections, research suggests that excessive empathy—particularly emotional empathy—can contribute to emotional distress, especially in individuals who frequently absorb others’ negative emotions. As a result, heightened emotional empathy has been linked to an increased risk of depression and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests that psilocybin can temporarily enhance empathy, particularly emotional empathy, by increasing feelings of connectedness and reducing ego-related barriers. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms (commonly referred to as “magic mushrooms”) and is known for its hallucinogenic effects. It interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, leading to altered perception, mood, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Johannes Jungwirth and his colleagues aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on the empathy levels of depressed individuals and compare these changes to those observed in a placebo group. They assessed empathy differences at two days, eight days, and thirteen days after treatment. Their hypothesis was that psilocybin would increase emotional empathy and that this effect would persist for up to two weeks post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 51 individuals experiencing an acute depressive episode, 19 of whom were men. The participants’ average age was between 36 and 37 years. Those taking psychiatric medication were required to undergo a washout period before the study began. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin (25 participants) or a placebo (an identical-looking, inactive medication; 26 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved seven in-person visits to the research lab over a four-week period. The first visit consisted of screening. Participants then attended two psychological preparation sessions—one four days before treatment and another one day before treatment. On the third visit, participants received either a single oral dose of psilocybin or a placebo. This was followed by three additional visits at two, eight, and fourteen days after treatment. During these follow-ups, participants attended psychological support sessions designed to help them process difficult emotions and develop a narrative about their experience. At these sessions, they also completed assessments of empathy (using the Multifaceted Empathy Test) and depression (using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psilocybin treatment led to an improvement in emotional empathy compared to the control (placebo) group. This improvement was evident as early as two days after treatment, peaked at eight days, and was moderate in magnitude. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups regarding cognitive empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the eight-day and fourteen-day follow-ups, individuals in the placebo group who experienced a stronger increase in emotional empathy also tended to show greater improvements in depressive symptoms. However, this association was not observed in the psilocybin group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide evidence for the lasting effects of psilocybin on empathy in depressed patients, with significant increases in explicit emotional empathy observed up to 14 days after treatment. Given that conventional antidepressants have been observed to reduce empathy, psilocybin could be a promising candidate for enhancing social cognition and strengthening therapeutic alliance,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study contributes to the scientific understanding of psilocybin’s effects on depressed individuals. However, it is important to note that the study groups were relatively small, meaning some weaker effects may have gone undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;Psilocybin increases emotional empathy in patients with major depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by J. Jungwirth, R. von Rotz, I. Dziobek, F. X. Vollenweider, and K. H. Preller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 15:51:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOcjd3cndHQURhNWhscmI5NDVMQkVpeDZwQkpkVFdTTWs4UzJwWDFRRTdZRE9MOGVVaUNEeTF0XzhRWm01TW1iTlJSQ0d4T054bXUxX0pSSnQzNVY4VUdKRXBweGRJUzhTcnUxQkNmWG54OGhtSXFrbVJVR1pVUXdFVmV3VmhuRGV0OTMtelJLYm5GUUpmek14ZjMtSG5qaExmNkE</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Warn That Antidepressants May Do More Harm Than Good in Dementia Patients - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOZkFKazRkbHY3ZHF0cjBMT1J0eUwwSUI0ZEYyYkp1RFlvVThLS1RycjZidUlzem1RSXlQamZqakhBUVBrcGhNMDdsSkR0UWQwOTdmdXFFbGtoM1N0VTFVSDNxaUs5UkZLbkRydU90LXN5ZEUwZmNRTmNOX2xFVWxpRnJZZjZOcmRHaWFRN1dUWTJLNU1MaEg3a0Q4bHBvMmk4dHl6c3MwdWVqbzk4a3NJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 15:31:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOZkFKazRkbHY3ZHF0cjBMT1J0eUwwSUI0ZEYyYkp1RFlvVThLS1RycjZidUlzem1RSXlQamZqakhBUVBrcGhNMDdsSkR0UWQwOTdmdXFFbGtoM1N0VTFVSDNxaUs5UkZLbkRydU90LXN5ZEUwZmNRTmNOX2xFVWxpRnJZZjZOcmRHaWFRN1dUWTJLNU1MaEg3a0Q4bHBvMmk4dHl6c3MwdWVqbzk4a3NJ</guid></item><item><title>For the 1st time in Canada, surgeons put teeth in patients’ eyes to restore sight - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNNG85TGhncGx4bWd0eUdydVlXWUxUcXdac2U3aUkzeHZMaEVNLWZqZUpLekl4Y2dRai1CdVgwUm5OTm9FQUs2eFMtcFNQNmdmbmYxa2t2UHJwSTRtazQzY3RnQ2d1UzhIWjJkMG5OY05nZnV2ZWE3MFhqd29nS2Q5V0l0bEE2UDBkeG9QNldCUzd2aDVmSEN6LUJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A blind Canadian man could soon see again thanks to a surprising source: his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Earlier this week, Brent Chapman underwent one of Canada’s first-ever “tooth in eye” surgeries. While it might sound like something straight out of science fiction, this jaw-dropping procedure has been restoring sight in other parts of the world for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a rare operation that most people have not heard of, even if you are an eye surgeon,” &lt;a href="https://drgregmoloneyvancouver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney&lt;/a&gt;, an ophthalmologist and surgeon at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital in Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The procedure, called osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, has been used in other parts of the world for decades.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors performed Canada’s first tooth in eye surgeries this week.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cheeky science &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis&lt;/a&gt; (OOKP), uses a patient’s own tooth to craft a support structure for an artificial cornea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The operation is broken down into two parts. First, Moloney and his team removed one of Chapman’s teeth, shaved it down into a rectangle, drilled a hole and popped a plastic optical lens inside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tooth then got a temporary home in his cheek, where it will stay for about three months.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“(The tooth) doesn’t have any connective tissue that I can actually pass a suture through to connect it to the eyeball,” &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/victoria-woman-becomes-1st-canadian-to-receive-rare-tooth-in-eye-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney told CTV News&lt;/a&gt;. “So the point of implanting it for three months is for it to gain the layer of supporting tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During the same procedure, Moloney prepared the eye by removing the top layer of the eye’s surface and replacing it with a soft tissue graft from inside Chapman’s cheek. This graft needs a few months to heal so it can support the implant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney said the initial procedure went smoothly, and Chapman will be monitored closely over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it’s time for the second surgery, Chapman’s tooth will be removed from his cheek and placed into his eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney and his team will pull back the graft, remove the damaged iris and lens, and sew the tooth (with its new optical lens) into the eye. The graft will then be resewn over the eye, leaving a small hole for the lens to peek through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end result is a pink eye with a small black circle through which Chapman will hopefully be able to finally see again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eyes on the prize &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A tooth might seem like an unlikely candidate for eye surgery, but it’s actually the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“(Teeth) contains dentin, which is the ideal tissue to house a plastic lens without the body rejecting it,” &lt;a href="https://thedailyscan.providencehealthcare.org/2025/02/canadas-first-tooth-in-eye-surgeries-aim-to-restore-bc-patients-sight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney explained to The Daily Scan&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, the tissue from the cheek recognizes the tooth, making the whole process smoother. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Surgeons typically use a canine tooth for the surgery.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get too excited just yet — this procedure isn’t risk-free. “With any ocular surgery of any kind, there’s a chance that we could introduce infection and lose all our vision,” Moloney told CBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also not meant for everyone. The surgery is often a last-ditch option for people with corneal blindness in the front of the eyes caused by conjunctival scarring from autoimmune diseases, chemical burns and other traumas, but who still have healthy retina and optic nerves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the risks, the procedure has been restoring sight for several decades in at least 10 countries with a high success rate. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 study out of Italy&lt;/a&gt; found that, 27 years post-surgery, 94% of patients still had vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney himself has done seven successful tooth in eye surgeries in Australia before bringing his talents to Canada. “The risk-reward ratio for these patients, when they have no vision at all, is well worth it, we think,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney has successfully performed the operation seven times.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A life-changing gamble &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman has undergone 50 surgeries over the past 20 years, all aimed at restoring his sight, and he hopes this is his last one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old massage therapist from North Vancouver is blind in both eyes due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare autoimmune reaction triggered by a dose of ibuprofen he took after a basketball game when he was just 13.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Though some of the surgeries he had gave him temporary partial sight, it always faded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I get it back, you know, it would be sort of this great rush,” he told CBC. “Then I’d lose it again and it would be heartbreaking, and I sort of sank into this depression.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, Chapman hopes things will be different. When his doctor first pitched the tooth in eye surgery, he was hesitant. But after speaking with an Australian woman who had undergone the same procedure to tremendous success, he was sold. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She had been completely blind for 20 years, and is now snow skiing,” he said. Today, Chapman is dreaming about shooting hoops again and traveling the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman is one of six patients in a pilot program at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital. If the surgeries go well, Moloney and his team plan to pitch Health Canada for funding to open the country’s first OOKP clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we’re successful in getting this up and running and stabilized in Vancouver, then we will be the only active North American center for the operation,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

I tried to stave off the inevitable by submerging myself in ice baths and drinking a brand of coffee that claimed to improve cognition. I paid too much for eye creams (to erase dark circles) and hair volumizers (to make my mane look fuller). I whitewashed my résumé, eliminating the year I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MK5ET53IZDBDNEASI5YMLRIHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I thought I needed to hide my age because of the ageism surrounding me: advertisements that depicted people my age as decrepit and frail, birthday cards that mocked us as deaf or daffy, and other media that simply erased us. For sure, I was not going gently into that good night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U65RTG35TFFN7AOVJ45D4OWQWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took me several more years to understand that there are different ways to understand ageism, including what researchers call “internalized ageism,” or discriminating against ourselves — and our contemporaries — as we age. Or as Todd D. Nelson, a professor of psychology at California State University at Stanislaus, who edited the book “Ageism,” put it: “&lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x?casa_token=Ki9-NmUKaHgAAAAA%3ARDOX-t29125hQrR2P5ZYcPhkHGPnOCIAbsXxjtoh_NqwhlEi8CdOdQQTSmZQMwle8QuyJ2r7GR53" target="_blank"&gt;prejudice against our feared future self&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C27WBUPA5NFBJE5QF2SDABB65E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sure, those of us 55-plus face negative stereotypes, bias and discrimination — in health care (exclusion from clinical trials because of age), on the job (being passed over for promotion) and by the media (all those “look younger” ads). But I finally realized that the antiaging messages I was hearing weren’t just coming from others. The awareness set me on a path to reverse my own aging biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QKM6M65MZAJ3OAL4SCCKH7ZIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Negative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07317115.2024.2355539#d1e223" target="_blank"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; with getting older have their own &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9757993/" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="525DQQCQBBFURN3CEAGJT6VEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LjiIqQDNPQ" target="_blank"&gt;Becca Levy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a leading researcher on the psychology of aging, has written that internalized ageism may take as much as 7.5 years off your life — about the same as heavy smoking. Levy argues in her book, “Breaking the Age Code: How Your Beliefs About Aging Determine How Long and Well You Live,” that those under 60 who hold negative aging stereotypes (frailty, cognitive decline) are more likely to have a heart attack or develop other cardiovascular conditions after they turn 60 than those who make positive associations with getting older (wisdom, loyalty, reliability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IKKE4BZPNEI7DHTXUW4UM744Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The way we think about aging affects how we age,” Levy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWTQWKBSEBFQ7P3PZIXPEVDUYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These negative associations get baked into our culture and our memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ3F3AH6QRGCTJPVXZIBUFTRA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be that way.

I joined one of his retreats in 2022, on the cusp of turning 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VGHTSDVBHK5AXZBYH2DGPPHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the MEA, I spent a week with 19 other individuals, hearing admissions such as, “It’s too late for me to learn new things,” or “I’m past the age where I can reinvent myself.” Conley warned us of the dangers of a “closed mindset,” or becoming rigid, fearing change and even believing it’s just too late for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFHYOGITK5F7VNBBLNTCEH7RO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an exercise called the Great Midlife Edit, we wrote down our associations with getting older on bits of paper. (You already know mine, which were very similar to the others’.) We then tossed these scraps — representing our old mindsets — into a bonfire, watching them incinerate. “We’re letting go,” a new friend said excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4BAHWFEGBCHDBXN75WJSANZBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the second day, Conley asked us to describe what he called “a replacement mindset” — a list of the positives of aging. There are plenty, including greater experience and wisdom, less judgment of others and more acceptance of ourselves, even increased contentment or equilibrium. I understood what Conley was saying, but it was going to take time for me to fully grasp the import of his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ"&gt;Putting beliefs into practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7I6XJO545FSJOG2GETW4FHUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the MEA, I began to think about intention and practice. Levy has outlined a three-stage process of bolstering positive age beliefs. The first is increasing awareness: “We know from our research that we often [hold] age beliefs without awareness and they can operate unconsciously.” She noted that children as young as 3 often internalize the age beliefs of the culture around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWBCGCDF2REC7PTSDXZYQ75APY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To combat this, Levy recommends journaling, “which involves writing down all the age beliefs you encounter over one week.” Was the portrayal positive or negative? Or were older people absent from a movie or a show, “because we know that lack of representation … can lead to them becoming marginalized as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OYFHY4IRD5GMXG4OOJAVE6KLFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her second exercise is to ask yourself: “Is what is said about older people ageist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SFWCTIMMFB2XD56FJJAAO5A6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ageism is considered one of the last acceptable forms of discrimination and can be challenging to call out. When you’re not sure if you’re seeing bias, Levy suggests changing the target to another marginalized group, such as women: “If an employee states the need to fire older workers, ask yourself how it would sound if the same comments were made about firing women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QN3VORSGH5F45BKQ7HD7PFCFEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, she recommends an exercise to dismantle negative age beliefs “by countering them with accurate information.” Consider the belief that cognition inevitably declines as we get older. “In fact, a number of types of cognition have been found to improve later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697608/" target="_blank"&gt;metacognition&lt;/a&gt;, or thinking about thinking,” Levy told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XCLFIPEUQRFYBONLROGVTNTRXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using her framework, I made a handful of pledges about how to reframe aging. Recently, I pointed out to a gift shop manager that the store sold only birthday cards that mocked older people. The manager, roughly my age, first took umbrage and then got my point, promising to order a different line. Similarly, when people tell me, “You look good for your age,” I nicely explain that that’s damning praise and ageist, because it implies most people my age look awful. (I know I’m looking a gift horse in the mouth.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y7PJZUFB6VEIFNS2YQHWG43ONU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m also trying to discourage the “organ recital,” that endless discussion of aches, illnesses and surgeries that dominates older folks’ social chatter and perpetuates negative stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NL7H4G6KFEVXPR7MK4FZGVS5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last and most challenging, I’ve stopped lying about my age, especially on dating apps. On my birthday this year, I posted a selfie, paraphrasing Gloria Steinem’s famous declaration, “This is what 40 looks like, ” except in my case, the caption read, “This is what 67 looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGJ4KS4JQVB7ZD6FLYGZINSUSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m not done, and will probably never be, but there are more benefits to be reaped.

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears to be gearing up for potentially substantial changes in vaccine policies, specifically with respect to the federal government’s messaging and the composition of the advisory panel responsible for making recommendations on vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is planning to remove several members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices due to what he &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" aria-label="views as conflicts of interest"&gt;views as conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP advises the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on which vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used; for example, recommending which groups of people ought to be vaccinated, at what doses and when. ACIP’s guidance is not binding, though CDC almost always follows it and provides recommendations to the public on what is to be included in the United States adult and childhood &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" aria-label="immunization schedules"&gt;immunization schedules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of HHS can hire or replace ACIP committee members, which may lead to new sets of CDC recommendations. ACIP’s first scheduled meeting since Trump was inaugurated &lt;a href="https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" aria-label="was postponed"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04"&gt;was postponed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week It’s not clear at this time exactly what this postponement signals, though in light of other changes within HHS it may be a foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the CDC has been &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" aria-label="ordered"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; to shelve promotions it developed for multiple vaccines, including a “Wild to Mild” advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against influenza. Secretary of HHS Kennedy says he wants advertisements that incorporate a more robust version of “informed consent.” Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any therapeutic they are prescribed. The Wild to Mild ads emphasizes the harm-reducing functions of vaccines, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women, young children and the immunocompromised. Evidently, Kennedy wants messages that are more focused on potential adverse events associated with vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just this week the FDA canceled a meeting of its flu vaccine advisors. The panel was set to convene to discuss the composition of the 2025-2026 influenza vaccine.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" aria-label="has previously said"&gt;has previously said &lt;/a&gt;that he is concerned about the pharmaceutical industry’s close relationship with government agencies and the entities such as ACIP that advise them. But it’s unclear what Kennedy means when current ACIP members include several academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up and the owner of a family medicine practice. (We reached out to Kennedy’s office for comment, but did not receive a reply)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at HHS are taking place against the backdrop of a large &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" target="_self" aria-label="measles outbreak"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; which began in West Texas and thus far has claimed the life of a child and hospitalized 19 others. Practically all the people who’ve contracted measles are unvaccinated. Yet Kennedy seems to be &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" aria-label="downplaying"&gt;downplaying&lt;/a&gt; the situation in Texas and New Mexico, suggesting that such outbreaks are not unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine-skeptic views are well-known. And while he &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" aria-label="told"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that some vaccines “are probably averting more problems than they’re causing,” he also maintained that “there’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” Kennedy recently informed employees within his department that he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" aria-label="vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule"&gt;vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; that prevents measles, polio and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this doesn’t come as a surprise. Kennedy has invariably been outspoken on vaccines and what he sees as public health agencies’ “suppression” of controversial treatments. Just prior to the November election, Kennedy &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" aria-label="posted"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on X, warning the FDA that its “aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, [and] hydroxychloroquine” was about to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" target="_self" aria-label="embroiled in a culture war"&gt;embroiled in a culture war&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic that pitted unproven treatments against proven measures, such as vaccines. Kennedy defends himself as merely wanting placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure and no vaccine mandates. However, the vaccines he rails against are typically subject to such clinical trials. Furthermore, arguably the mandates Kennedy opposes, which have been in place since the 1960s, have helped to contribute to a dramatic decline in childhood infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From smallpox inoculations—which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s—to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccinations have saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, mass vaccination programs with single or combination—measles, mumps and rubella—shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is “&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" aria-label="sterilizing"&gt;sterilizing&lt;/a&gt;,” which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the Secretary of HHS nor the CDC director can unilaterally ban vaccines. But they can alter the CDC’s messaging, hire and fire ACIP committee members and revise vaccine scheduling. The fact that the HHS secretary and probable CDC director, nominee Dave Weldon, have aligned views could facilitate the process of transforming vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" aria-label="bill"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; which Weldon sponsored sought to undo what he saw as a conflict of interest entailed by CDC being both a promoter of vaccines and an evaluator of their safety. This echoes Kennedy’s opinion on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Weldon be confirmed, he will be making the decisions regarding whether a vaccine should be recommended to the public.

meant to be given to children in a series of two shots at 12 to 15 months old as well as between the ages of four and six years old – through its immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Earlier, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upheld the role of vaccines in offering protection against measles after an unvaccinated child died from an infection this week. The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group. However, he has claimed he is not “anti-vaccine” and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A total of 164 measles cases were reported as of 27 February across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas, information from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; showed. About 95% of those infected were unvaccinated people, including children whose parents did not follow CDC recommendations to get them immunized with safe, effective vaccines providing protection against measles as well as other easily preventable diseases. Another 3% were from people who received only one of the two required shots for immunity, CDC data showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These cases were reported in nine jurisdictions, including Kentucky, marking a near 80% jump from 93 cases reported a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also on Friday, Kennedy’s health and human services department announced plans to eliminate public participation in many of the agency’s policy decisions – a proposal that explicitly flouts a promise of “radical transparency” that he previously made to Congress while lawmakers considered confirming his appointment to the cabinet of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The health and human services department has allowed such public comment on a range of agency actions for decades. It would mark a noted shift in the rulemaking process at the agency, which directs $3tn in healthcare spending and oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid – which insure more than 140 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters contributed reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 14:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcmJpTjdaUXp4UFNIeXNOdmZMZk04MFNZczNUQS01dmJyWVdkTVBpbndMWTZDZzc4ZWpIaXd3T3hodEx5LTVWV2RNZ0FFbXdjWVQwdmdBaFJmb21Kc0dRdDlvb2dCRUp5dTR1d3ZHbVNrUTFHc0s1ODl3NU5RTFNZUEotVS1LcE8wVFh1TVR2YTNPbjZaMUVmTQ</guid></item><item><title>10 Thoughtful Food and Drink Gifts for Flu and Cold Recovery - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOUnU1VFd2cDU0ZmQzUW5GWjEtSGhOS19wZnl5a2lUYk5nYkE4VEQyS25yb0Uxd3FaenM5RFk3Vnp3LUl3Y1Y5YzNYMlNwbzdBdnh3RV9pY3o4emlWYTJpRWRIRnF2NnpGLVNrTXp6cUJhVE14VHcwVXRZT2MyNHh6Zk4tNERXYk5Ta2RNLWlaMWE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another great choice to send is bone broth, which provides nutrients and soothes a sore throat.

Unlike the Western model of learning one language from a primary caregiver, these children acquire language through a dynamic social environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local languages like Akan, Ga, and Ewe are learned mainly through direct interactions, while English is acquired more indirectly via media and official communication. These findings highlight the need for a broader perspective on language acquisition that reflects global linguistic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Ghanaian infants hear two to six languages from multiple caregivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct vs. Indirect Input:&lt;/strong&gt; Local languages come from direct interactions, while English is learned mainly through media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redefining Language Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The study challenges Western assumptions about single-language learning models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Potsdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study that examined 121 babies aged three to twelve months in Accra, the capital of Ghana, demonstrates a remarkable variety of language input in the early months of life. The children are regularly exposed to two to six languages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strikingly, the number of caregivers the children have also ranges between two and six, and babies who have more adults in their daily lives who regularly take care of them also hear more different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ghana, families often live in so-called “compound buildings”, where many everyday interactions take place in the courtyard, where family, neighbors and other relatives play an important role in the lives of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that a child learns only one particular language from a single caregiver, as is often assumed in Western cultures, does not apply to these communities. Rather, children are surrounded by a rich spectrum of linguistic inputs from the very beginning,” says Paul O. Omane, the first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of studies on children’s language acquisition have been conducted in Western industrialized nations, which is why they often focus on a rather narrow conception of multilingualism. Our research shows that other societies show a much more vibrant multilingual environment,” the study’s lead researcher, Prof. Dr. Natalie Boll-Avetisyan adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding of the study is the distinction between direct and indirect language input. While English is primarily acquired through indirect channels such as television and official communication, children receive most of the local languages (such as Akan, Ga and Ewe) through direct contact with their caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the proportion of direct input is higher in the local languages than in English, which is predominantly present as indirect input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often emphasized how important direct language contact is for language acquisition,” Natalie Boll-Avetisyan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, our results suggest that indirect input – especially through media and official communication – also plays an essential role in the children’s daily lives, particularly in urban contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of their empirical study, the researchers call for a broader view in language research. The common assumptions do not reflect the diversity and complexity found in other cultural contexts such as Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study makes it clear that it is not only the number of languages a child hears, but also the diversity of people and the different forms of input that have a decisive influence on language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that for many children, a multilingual environment is a dynamic, vibrant reality from the very beginning. Multilingualism is not just a bonus, but a fundamental part of children’s identity and social structure,” the researcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c6aba7b2b2aeafa7b5e8bcafababa3b4aba7a8a886b3a8afebb6a9b2b5a2a7abe8a2a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthias Zimmermann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-potsdam.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Potsdam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthias Zimmermann – University of Potsdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2025.101558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploring the nature of multilingual input to infants in multiple caregiver families in an African city: The case of Accra (Ghana)&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalie Boll-Avetisyan et al. &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the nature of multilingual input to infants in multiple caregiver families in an African city: The case of Accra (Ghana)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining the language input experiences of infants growing up in multilingual African environments is essential to understanding their language acquisition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We explored the language input to 3;0–12;0-month-old infants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 121) in Ghana (Sub-Saharan Africa), a non-Western and less-economically rich social context and highly multilingual country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data collection involved an interview assessment, followed by caregivers completing a 12-hour logbook to indicate the languages their child heard over a day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results demonstrated consistency of the infant’s language exposure across both input measurement tools, suggesting their reliability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results revealed that Ghanaian infants are raised multilingually, exposed to between two and six languages, and engage with between two and six regular input providers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was no evidence for associations of age with number of languages or regular input providers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analyses of the relative amount of input in Ghanaian English, Akan, Ewe, and Ga, revealed that infants receive less direct than indirect input in Ghanaian English, with no such difference observed in Akan, Ewe, Ga, and no evidence of age effects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These findings shed light on the language environment and input to African infants raised in multilingual societies, highlighting the impact of social and cultural contexts on linguistic input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude with reflections on studying infants in non-Western, less-economically Rich social contexts in multilingual Africa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:34:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOT092eExyNVp5cDJncGNIZTNrZ24tWmZQLThnbG5wbnZvaHFCQVkxWFltRWpvbmJaVnZTWmpreXVjOEtmTDFWaDlib0R1c0ZLWG1vVzRhb3NMRDBJWFltZFhpanBxQ21TMHpaVjRReG9oOVprdl9Zbngyc0xXU1kzR1dCRQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
