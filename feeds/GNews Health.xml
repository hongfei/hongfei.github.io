The most pronounced effect was seen in individuals with schizophrenia, while common disorders like depression and anxiety also reduced parenthood rates—especially among men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences between genders were notable, with men generally less likely to have children than women with the same diagnosis. The study suggests that challenges in forming stable partnerships may partly explain these outcomes, emphasizing the need for accessible mental health support for young people navigating major life choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Parenthood Likelihood:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression reduced fatherhood by 38% and motherhood by 19%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Men with mental disorders were less likely to have children or cohabit than women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schizophrenia Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Strongest effect seen in individuals with schizophrenia diagnoses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has revealed a link between mental disorders and a lower likelihood of parenthood among young people in Finland. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research comes at a time when many individuals are postponing parenthood to later ages. Concurrently, mental health issues among young people have become increasingly prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Finnish register data from over 1,2 million participants, the study found that both young men and women diagnosed with mental disorders are less likely to become parents compared to those without such diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were found for schizophrenia: persons diagnosed with this disorder were highly unlikely to have their first child by age 39 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, also reduced the likelihood of parenthood. For example, men diagnosed with depression were 38% less likely to become fathers compared to those without depression diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among women, depression was associated with 19%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lower likelihood of becoming a mother when compared to persons without depression disorder diagnosis. The similar difference between men and women were also observed for anxiety disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The differences between men and women were clear for many disorders, with men having a lower likelihood of having a first child compared to women with the same disorder”, says Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Kateryna Golovina&lt;/strong&gt;, university researcher and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role of partnership status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored the role of partnership status in the link between mental disorders and parenthood. Since stable relationships are often a key factor in having children, difficulties in forming or maintaining partnerships may partially explain lower parenthood rates among people with mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a clear pattern: men with mental disorders were significantly less likely to cohabit than women with similar diagnoses”, says Associate Professor &lt;strong&gt;Christian Hakulinen&lt;/strong&gt;, PI of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of accessible mental health services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the need for accessible, high-quality mental health services for young people. Providing long-term support may be particularly crucial in helping people with mental disorders navigate life decisions, including family formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research underscores the importance of well-functioning mental health services with low-threshold access, ensuring young people receive the support they need for both their well-being and life aspirations,” says Kateryna Golovina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This study was supported by the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, University of Helsinki (KG); the Finnish Cultural Foundation (KG, Grant 00200993); the Otto A.

People diagnosed with schizophrenia and intellectual disabilities were the least likely to become parents. Adjusting for partnership status attenuated the associations for all mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before age 25, substance use, childhood onset, anxiety, or any mental disorders were associated with a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; likelihood of first childbirth, but after age 30, mental disorders were linked to a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; likelihood of parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="bjo18151-sec-0008-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all mental disorders were associated with a lower likelihood of having a first child among young people born in 1980–1995. These findings imply that well-functioning mental health services are important from a fertility perspective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:20:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE0wQVFKbGJRdEFOWjlMVUp6MEhmZGpQdHoyTlBQa3hEV0FiTU9WSnVQRG9VM0EtQlNwWFhDZXRBTTA0UVdGSlc4SWtmWUJXX3RzM0JUM2t6VnUxRnV4cVY3NDdVZUhvbWo3RjlZ</guid></item><item><title>为下一次大流行做准备：京都的预警网络- Earth.com | Preparing for the next pandemic: Kyoto's early-warning network - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNcXYyOTA5cS12S1Y4SjJzTFF2bDRJTjFRZm56aFRlakVEblVkSlJDUTR2TEcxVDhkel9vNVE3bnZVeVo1bm5CRnBya0tBSEkzTEF2a3RsNzJDc3B4bnFsNWFIaC1qWkRDRi0tZjdFSy1iaVpxUkQ2QkFZNzhqTnMyT3BobjlmcUVvZTIwZ05iWlBVZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyoto, Japan, has experienced its share of pandemic challenges for centuries. One such outbreak struck in 869 and left an unforgettable legacy that shaped the city’s future approach to epidemics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the deadly plague, Emperor Seiwa established the Gion Festival in an effort to appease the vengeful spirits that were believed to be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That historical memory reemerged when the beloved Gion Festival was canceled in 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-on-hard-earned-lessons"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building on hard-earned lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease clinician and microbiologist Dr. Miki Nagao from &lt;a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt; is leading a program that aims to fortify the city against the next big threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We might not be able to stop the next pandemic,” said Dr. Nagao. She and her colleagues have focused on improving detection, analysis, and response plans to minimize the damage a new pandemic might cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effort includes improving local hospital networks and establishing rapid testing systems so emerging pathogens can be tracked and contained swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her team emphasizes the importance of a citywide pathogen surveillance network that gathers insights from nursing homes, public health labs, and hospital facilities. These data points create an early-warning system for spotting outbreaks before they cascade into full-blown crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reinventing-kyoto-s-pandemic-monitoring"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinventing Kyoto’s pandemic monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A citywide approach has already shown results. One &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.12977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported that a coordinated testing strategy in Kyoto’s aged-care facilities helped limit COVID-19 clusters during significant pandemic waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network’s strength lies in integrating clinical data with large-scale sample analysis. Teams keep an eye on infection patterns, share findings with public health authorities, and adapt interventions quickly when new threats arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative includes high-throughput genetic testing to pinpoint specific pathogens. This allows for an efficient response by healthcare workers, who can then target treatments and reduce exposure in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also stress the need to understand communitywide behavior. Changes in social interactions, public gatherings, or medical practices all affect how diseases spread, so researchers examine these factors alongside lab data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-silent-pathogen-hazard"&gt;A silent pathogen hazard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-create-viruses-to-combat-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria&lt;/a&gt; add urgency to these efforts. An influential report warned that AMR could claim millions of lives worldwide by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One genetic analysis revealed that a single clade of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/11/16-0519_article"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/a&gt; has driven much of the global spread of this resistance. This insight underscores how a single microbial lineage can become a massive threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nagao’s team looks at both global trends and local cases. They study bacteria circulating in Kyoto and cross-reference that information with international data to identify worrisome shifts in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another investigation, the researchers found that particular clones of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/3/22-1060_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus dysgalactiae&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;carried sets of resistance genes that made these strains harder to treat. This evidence supports the push for more robust diagnostics and localized prevention measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scaling-up-diagnostics"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling up diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hidden-death-toll-of-covid-19-pandemic-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the risks of relying on limited testing capacity. Dr. Nagao’s group recognized the need for powerful diagnostic devices that can handle large workloads while still delivering quick, accurate results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An automated system called PCRpack was introduced to speed up tests for high-priority pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Its design lowers the need for extra technicians, which helps laboratories keep pace during hectic surges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research hospitals in Kyoto have set up these automated devices to run tests around the clock. Managers say it has prevented diagnostic bottlenecks and led to faster turnaround times for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic improvements are also vital for what experts call the 100 Days Mission. This global initiative strives to have vaccines, treatments, and reliable tests ready within 100 days of recognizing a new pandemic threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-joining-forces-for-tomorrow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining forces for tomorrow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nagao’s team collaborates with medical manufacturers, health economists, and academics from various fields. Each partner contributes specialized knowledge to paint a clearer picture of how infections move through communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From our perspective, both epidemic viral infections and AMR are ‘pandemic pathogens,’” said Dr. Yasufumi Matsumura, an associate professor at Kyoto University. Specialists in immunology, vaccine creation, and bioinformatics share resources, boosting the collective impact of the city’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto network runs on real-life data from patient samples, not just abstract models. It offers a clinical angle that bridges basic science and public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-staying-ahead-of-outbreaks"&gt;Staying ahead of outbreaks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many research teams focus on either microbiological analysis or social patterns. This project aims to link the two. Such comprehensive data can guide health campaigns, resource allocation, and targeted interventions for potential outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay prepared, Dr. Nagao and her colleagues keep refining lab methods, strengthening collaborations, and watching for new pathogens around the globe. Their approach offers a blueprint for other regions that want to stay a step ahead of infectious surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pathogens are invisible to the naked eye,” said Dr. Nagao.

                A health worker in Karachi administers polio drops — the oral vaccine — on February 3, the first day of a nationwide polio vaccination campaign. The country, one of only two where wild polio circulates, has seen a rise in cases due to issues with vaccination campaigns.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The world is so close to wiping out polio. But in 2025, there are sign that the virus is not quite ready to go the way of smallpox — the only disease eradicated by humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two countries are seeing an increase in cases caused by the wild polio virus, which can cause paralysis and even death, particularly in infants and young children. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the cuts in USAID contracts that support polio vaccination raise concern that other countries will see a resurgence as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with in-country vaccination campaigns and global aid, Pakistan and Afghanistan have so far &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-polio-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been unable to stop transmission of the disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, Pakistan's numbers spiked to 74 while Afghanistan saw 24 recorded polio cases. So far this year, Pakistan has reported 6 cases and Afghanistan has reported 1. These new cases are tied to disruptions in ongoing vaccine campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Global health officials say there's real concern that those numbers could balloon and that polio could reemerge in other countries as well in the wake of the dismantling of USAID. In a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/10/g-s1-52964/rubio-announces-that-83-of-usaid-contracts-will-be-canceled" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;series of memos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drafted by Nicholas Enrich, the acting assistant administrator for global health at USAID, and obtained by the press, including NPR, the potential for damage is quantified with estimates of how many people would possibly become sick and die if the pause in U.S. aid continues. Enrich projected an additional 200,000 cases of polio that cause paralysis each year, and hundreds of millions of infections overall.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The sudden cuts to U.S. funding are also affecting efforts to eradicate polio," said director general of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Kenya, for example, the International Rescue Committee was part of a team doing polio vaccinations along with the Ministry of Health and World Vision. Much of that work was paid for by USAID.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That actually was the first [of our USAID projects] to shut down on the 31st of January," says Mohamed El Montassir Hussein, country director for the International Rescue Committee in Kenya. "Currently IRC's support for polio vaccination in remote areas has stopped [because of the halt in U.S. funding] and future support is in question. The Ministry of Health vaccination efforts, though greatly impacted, continues."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the numbers there, while relatively low, raise the question: Why does the wild virus persist in these two countries when it's been eradicated from &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/poliomyelitis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the rest of the world since 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? (Other countries have experienced cases of vaccine-derived polio, which can occur when the weakened virus in the oral vaccine mutates and regains its ability to cause paralysis).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here is a look at what is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Pakistan is seeing a resurgence &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Usman Ali, a 2-year-old, is one of 74 children in five Pakistani provinces known to have contracted polio in 2024. He is now experiencing partial paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[I fear] my youngest son will not be able to walk or play for the rest of his life," says his mother, Naik Margha.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ali lives in Balochistan province, bordering Afghanistan. When polio workers came door-to-door in late April last year in his village of simple mud and brick houses, the child had a fever. His parents worried the vaccine would make his illness worse, so they refused it. They asked polio workers to mark his finger with purple ink anyway to make it look like he'd been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ali had fevers on and off for several weeks, and in June, began having trouble walking.  His parents rushed him to a private clinic for treatment. When a later test of his stool sample came back positive for polio, they realized it was paralysis and could be permanent. Since then, Ali has recovered somewhat but still has partial paralysis in one leg.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ali's community is comprised of seasonal migrants who travel yearly to herd their sheep, mostly in the plains of neighboring Punjab province. Their village lacks toilets and sanitation, and people defecate in the open, which health officials say puts around 2,000 other children at risk of contracting polio, which can be spread by contact with human waste.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is a vulnerable community. They can easily carry the virus from one place to another place," says Saeedullah Lawoon, a polio community communication officer in the district.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Polio has surged despite Pakistan's extensive surveillance program and repeated door-to-door vaccination campaigns, highlighting shortcomings in the country's polio program. Pakistan has struggled to maintain the necessary high rates of immunization while combating vaccine fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To be optimally protected from polio, health care experts recommend that children in Pakistan receive two doses of the injectable vaccine and at least three doses of the oral — an aggressive course aimed at interrupting transmission. In 2023, only 84% of the country's eligible children received two doses of the injectable vaccine, according to World Health Organization and UNICEF estimates shared by the Pakistan Polio Programme. while 86% of children received three doses of the oral vaccine during routine immunization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have higher coverage in Punjab overall, but very low coverage in Balochistan, parts of Karachi, parts of South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan and even Southern Punjab," says Dr. Hamid Jafari, the WHO director of polio eradication for the region. "[There is] huge provincial variation. Punjab is 60% of the country, so it can skew the national average." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates during door-to-door drives can surpass 90%, according to Pakistan Polio Programme data, but these campaigns only offer the oral vaccine. To receive the injectable vaccine, parents must travel to designated facilities. The injectable vaccine is harder to administer and requires trained health workers and sanitary conditions.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The result is that some children in Pakistan only receive the oral vaccine, while some aren't vaccinated at all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than half of the polio cases in Pakistan last year were from children who hadn't received a single dose of either version of the vaccines. The other 45% were children who had received the oral polio vaccine, sometimes up to seven times, according to case data. Experts say receiving that many doses is not dangerous for a child. Pakistan's Polio Programme says what's important is that every child is vaccinated during each vaccine campaign to maintain their immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pakistan's polio eradication&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;program was started in 1994 and made strides early on to significantly reduce the number of polio cases in the country, which used to be in the tens of thousands. Between 1994 and 2013, the country managed to reduce the average number of annual cases by around 96%,&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.archive.polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5.1_12IMB.pdf__;!!Iwwt!RS72jUWfN0OpNxIZE7i8yko7FAEuOXYySX0CvJs0N70RYfoCAAQDrWpsRLwmRMhWWRU05_TkXhcefKQ1$" target="_blank"&gt; from 2,635 to 93&lt;/a&gt;. Case numbers seesawed in the following years before reaching an all-time low in 2021, when Pakistan recorded only one infection&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although cases have fluctuated in the past, experts say last year's increase was particularly alarming. Zulfiqar Bhutta, founding director of The Institute for Global Health and Development at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, says there's also not one reason why. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It isn't one single factor that leads to polio exacerbations, ups and downs in Pakistan. It's always a combination," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bhutta attributes the spike in part to laxity with door-to-door vaccination campaigns. In some cases parents or health workers will mark a child's finger who hasn't been vaccinated, which he attributes to fatigue among health workers under pressure to hit vaccination targets and exhausted from dealing with uncooperative parents. He also cites inadequate supervision of vaccine workers on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then there's vaccine distrust — still a problem in parts of Pakistan and in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;neighboring Afghanistan. Some think the vaccine will affect fertility, while others believe vaccines are part of a Western conspiracy. The distrust of aid workers grew after the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2013/klag-CIA-vaccination-cover-pakistan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CIA operated under the guise of a vaccine campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to search for Osama Bin Laden in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Polio workers also struggle to access certain areas because of conflict and security risks. In the past decade, they've become the target of militant groups who accuse them of being government spies or agents of the West.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some cases, parents refuse vaccines for their children because they've grown tired of repeat visits by polio workers, who are required to give oral polio drops during each vaccination campaign to every child under the age of 5 — including those who've received them multiple times before.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;According to a September 2024 report by the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Independent Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, over four million Pakistani children missed being vaccinated last year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Polio spreads quickly within unvaccinated communities, and mobile populations carry the virus from one part of the country to the next. People also bring it with them across the border from neighboring Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past, both Afghanistan and Pakistan have each come close to eradicating the virus, says Dr. Jafari of WHO. But the two nations' vaccine campaigns didn't align, so pockets of polio can persist and spread between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been very difficult to find a time period where the progress was well synchronized so that they both would interrupt transmission at the same time," he says. "Polio is an epidemic-prone disease. That means that if you don't interrupt transmission, it resurges after every few years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A number of recent cases involve children who avoided severe paralysis, thanks to some level of protection from oral vaccines, says Zia Ur Rehman, spokesperson for the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme. "That is very encouraging. And it shows that there is always a benefit of repeated vaccination." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pakistan held its first vaccination drive of the year in early February in an attempt to ensure that all children under age 5 have received at least one dose of the oral vaccine, with the goal of eventually achieving herd immunity. This should occur with polio when around 80% of the population is vaccinated, although Pakistan presents a special challenge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's no clear threshold for herd immunity in Pakistan, according to WHO's Hamid Jafari. "There isn't just one figure that we can go with in terms of what level of immunity do you need to stop transmission." He said the 80% rate might be an average figure for countries with better sanitation and less population density, but in South Asia, higher vaccination rates are needed to interrupt transmission.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The campaign aimed to reach about 45 million children around the country.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to Pakistan's Polio Programme, health workers vaccinated about 200,000 fewer children than the target, though it's difficult to independently verify.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The number of children nationwide who didn't receive the vaccine because family members refused was around 66,000, according to Pakistan Polio Programme data. The next countrywide vaccination campaign is set to take place in April. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the virus has been detected in sewage samples around the country this year, including in Punjab province, home to around half of Pakistan's children. Before a case was confirmed there last year, the province had been without a case of polio since 2020. Punjab has had one polio case so far in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bhutta said the widespread circulation of the virus means the situation could quickly spiral into something much worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is like sitting on the top of a volcano. This can erupt anytime."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in vaccination strategy leave some children behind in Afghanistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, a 35-year-old Afghan businessman named Mohammad noticed that his youngest son's hand looked extremely thin and was bending at an unnatural angle. A few tests later, he and his wife's worst fears were confirmed: "We were told he was infected with the polio virus," he tells NPR. "We missed his vaccines, and now a part of his hand is paralyzed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mohammad, who requested his full name be withheld fearing reprisal for criticizing the Taliban government, blames his son's condition on the decision to suspend door-to-door vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58128" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the Taliban announced a temporary suspension of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/sep/17/taliban-curbs-women-risk-polio-outbreak-vaccination-campaign-health-officials-warn" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;door-to-door vaccination campaigns across the country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No official reason was provided; however, health workers familiar with the situation said that the ban was a result of suspicion of Western aid and the Taliban's restrictions placed on women workers, who aren't allowed to travel without a male legal guardian.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"They stopped the health workers from coming to the communities, and instead moved the vaccinations to the local mosques," Mohammad says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mohammad, who has four other children who are vaccinated and healthy, says that campaign suspensions coupled with the Taliban restrictions made it hard for his family to get the children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As a sole breadwinner, I travel a lot for work, and the women in the family can't just walk to the local mosque to get vaccines," he says, referring to the Taliban's ban on women's movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although the number of polio cases in Afghanistan is significantly less than in Pakistan, the spike was "extremely high" in 2024, according to health officials –- 24 cases compared to just six the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The main reason for this increase is the poor quality of vaccination campaigns, particularly the lack of house-to-house distribution system which has been very successful in the past," says an Afghan health official who requested anonymity, fearing Taliban backlash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The spread is alarming, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only countries that have failed to eliminate the polio virus, Afghanistan had made some progress in reducing cases in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, the various Taliban groups in the region have long held suspicions that the door-to-door vaccination programs involving Western aid might be used to spy on communities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a result, for many years during its war with the U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the Taliban refused to allow immunization campaigns in areas they controlled. When the Taliban took over Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, health workers had hoped they could finally be allowed access to previously unreachable parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, the Taliban expanded their ban across the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination drives have also been hampered by the Taliban's successive bans on women's employment across various sectors, including in NGOs and development work.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Women are crucial to such campaigns because in a conservative country like Afghanistan they would be more welcome by families and communities with women and children, unlike the men, which allows them to not only provide vaccines and raise awareness but is also crucial to reporting some of the cases," the health official explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58130" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Children wait to receive polio vaccination in Nangarhar province, east Afghanistan, in November 2024 — part of a three-day campaign kicked off in 11 out of Afghanistan's 34 provinces that month, according to the Ministry of Public Health. Sharafat Zaman Amarkhail, the ministry's spokesperson, said 5.3 million children under age 5 were expected to receive vaccine doses during the campaign.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Instead, he says, the remaining, mostly male, health workers have been advised by the Taliban to conduct campaigns in mosques across the country, where families are expected to bring their children for doses. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This leaves many children unvaccinated since most families aren't aware or proactive about getting vaccines," the health official says, adding that for the vaccines to be successful, at least 95% of children under the age of 5 need to be covered during each campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For most families experiencing poverty, polio vaccine is not a priority," he points out. According to &lt;a href="https://unocha.org/publications/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-humanitarian-update-november-2024" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.N. estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than half the Afghan population relied on humanitarian assistance in 2024 from charities like the U.N.'s World Food Programme.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in densely packed areas with limited sanitation, many children are already struggling with health issues that make them more vulnerable to polio.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Immunity among children is low and there are other diseases like diarrhea, malnutrition that is also spreading, alongside a lack of hygiene and sanitation which makes it a deadly combination," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Afghan health workers say they are continuing to advocate, alongside international organizations, to resume door-to-door campaigns. In the meantime, health care workers are encouraging parents to bring their children to local vaccination centers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't act now, we may be faced with many tragic cases across the region, because infections don't see borders and can spread fast," the health official warns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Mohammad's youngest son, though, it might already be too late. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"All my children except the little one were vaccinated at home. I appeal to the [village] elders to [negotiate with the officials to] resume the door-to-door vaccinations again because not every family can travel to a public space and get the vaccines," he says. "It is not a matter of just my family or province, we are talking million of innocent children who are at risk."&lt;/p&gt;

                CT scans use ionizing radiation to create cross-sectional images of the body, providing more detail than X-rays.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;CT scans diagnose afflictions from tumors to kidney stones to life-threatening diseases and injuries, such as aneurysms and blood clots leading to stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the radiation emitted by this essential diagnostic tool may cause more harm than previously known and could eventually be responsible for roughly 5% of all cancers diagnosed in the U.S. in a single year, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#:~:text=Question%20How%20many%20future%20cancers,approximately%20103%20000%20future%20cancers." target="_blank"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; finds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Medical imaging has potential benefits," said radiologist &lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/smith-bindman.rebecca" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of the study published Monday in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine. &lt;/em&gt;"It has potential harms as well, and it's really important to balance them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists long ago established that ionizing radiation emitted by &lt;a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/computed-tomography-ct#pid-1021" target="_blank"&gt;computed tomography&lt;/a&gt;, or CT, scans increases cancer risk. But, since 2007, use of the imaging technique has surged 35%, the study says, due in part to growth in what Smith-Bindman and her colleagues call "low-value, potentially unnecessary imaging."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their new research, based on projections from hospitals in 20 U.S. states, estimates that 103,000 cancer diagnoses, or 5% of all cancers, could result from 93 million scans performed in the U.S. in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's nothing you can do about radiation that you've been exposed to already. But you want to limit future exposure to cases when you really need it," Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some scans might add no diagnostic value, she said. Moreover, the amount of radiation a scan emits fluctuates widely and can be far higher than necessary with the operator, not the machine, making the difference, she said. The dose at one scanning facility can be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/opinion/we-are-giving-ourselves-cancer.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank"&gt;50 times stronger&lt;/a&gt; than at another.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Dana Smetherman, chief executive officer of the American College of Radiologists, praised the study for bringing awareness to the question of radiation risk. Some people are unaware, for example, that ultrasounds and MRIs do not emit radiation and that CT scans do, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"As radiologists, we always want patients to be informed and feel comfortable asking the questions, 'tell me more about this test, what's involved, what's it going to show you?' " said Smetherman, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Echoing &lt;a href="https://www.acr.org/News-and-Publications/Media-Center/2025/jama-ct-scan-radiation-study" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American College of Radiology after the study's release, she stressed that the study's projection of cancer diagnoses from CT scans was based on statistical modeling, not actual patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are no published studies directly linking CT scans to cancer, the statement says. "Americans should not forgo necessary, life-saving medical imaging and continue to discuss the benefits and risks of these exams with their healthcare providers," it continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CT scans use ionizing radiation to create cross-sectional pictures inside the body. The scans can reveal more detail than conventional X-rays and are accurate, quick and relatively inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nationally, the new cancer projections from CT scans put them on par with other well-known, population-wide risk factors for cancers, like alcohol and obesity, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832782" target="_blank"&gt;an editor's note &lt;/a&gt;accompanying the study points out. Cigarette smoking remains the leading contributor to U.S. cancers, causing 19% of them, followed by excess body weight at 7.6% and alcohol consumption at 5%, Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To curtail radiation exposure, authors of the study and the editorial urge changes to current practices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The surest way to eliminate exposure to radiation from CT scans is to stop doing the low-value ones. Yet efforts to restrict them, including an initiative from the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation called &lt;a href="https://www.choosingwisely.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Choosing Wisely&lt;/a&gt; that launched in 2012, have fallen short, Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She believes the greatest opportunity to reduce risk from CT scans is to optimize the dose used in each scan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We can absolutely try to reduce all those excessive doses," she said. "We need buy-in from physicians and hospitals."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says patients can try to reduce their cancer risk by discussing with their doctors how important it is to get any particular scan and how they might&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;receive as small a dose of radiation from a scan as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The University of California, San Francisco, hosts a website called &lt;a href="https://knowyourdose.ucsf.edu/how-much-radiation" target="_blank"&gt;Know Your Dose &lt;/a&gt;in an effort to empower patients to ask questions about how much radiation they're getting from scans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A brain scan, the website shows, can emit as little radiation as 200 dental X-rays or as much as 1,600. The radiation dose from an abdominal scan for a suspected kidney stone can be as low as 100 dental X-rays or as high as 8,000. Kidney stones also sometimes can be diagnosed with ultrasound, which does not emit radiation, the website notes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for the striking differences in radiation emissions is that sometimes patients are scanned just once, and other times they're scanned multiple times. Multiple images often are unnecessary, Smith-Bindman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though she and others have been &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/ct-scans-cancer-risk-radiation-rules-research/" target="_blank"&gt;pushing for federal standards&lt;/a&gt; for dosages, there are none.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under a &lt;a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/ecqm/eh/2025/cms1074v2?qt-tabs_measure=measure-information" target="_blank"&gt;Medicare measurement tool&lt;/a&gt; released in January, hospitals and imaging facilities share information about how much radiation their scanners emit. Based upon the information, Smith-Bindman and her colleagues are developing a quality measure for CT scanning. So far, she said, one-third of scans exceed the targets in their testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need patients to ask their doctors, 'Can you use low dose when you scan me?' " Smith-Bindman said. "It's crazy that patients have to ask for it, but it's actually really successful."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is a freelance writer in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;When Daisy Hildebrand became the second Texas child to die of measles on April 3, her physicians reported – &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/notifiable-conditions"&gt;per the state health code&lt;/a&gt; – the 8-year-old’s death to local officials in Lubbock where she died and in tiny Gaines County where the girl lived.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In deference to the girl’s family, who planned to bury her the following Sunday, officials determined that sharing the news with the public could wait until the following week. “There’s a protocol that is generally followed,” said Zach Holbrooks, the executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which covers four counties, including Gaines. “We put information out in a measured, careful manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But Holbrooks’ plans were dashed when the day before Daisy’s funeral, communication of her death was leaked by private channels and commandeered by a vocal, growing movement critical of vaccines. Instead of a clinical state or hospital press release, news of Daisy’s death came from the highly-charged writings of vaccine critic Dr. Robert Malone, a physician once labeled by The New York Times as a “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html"&gt;Covid misinformation star.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Breaking news: Another Texas child dies a tragic death after recovering from measles,” Malone wrote in a Saturday evening &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on X. The Virginia doctor directed his 1.3 million followers to a 930-word substack essay where he accuses the University Medical Center in Lubbock of mismanaging Daisy’s case and purports that she died not from measles, but from sepsis after having been ill from mononucleosis and tonsillitis. She had already recovered from measles, Malone wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That announcement — and the flurry of media inquiries that came next — perplexed community health leaders who spent the weekend stumbling through a communications plan, in which they reiterated that the child had died of measles pulmonary failure.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;More importantly, the revelation circumvented the wishes of the people most important in the case, Daisy’s family. Peter Hildebrand, Daisy’s father, told The Texas Tribune on Tuesday he did not know how his daughter’s death information was made public.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I have never even heard that name before,” Hildebrand said, referring to Malone. “So he’s the reason I was sitting there [at my daughter’s funeral], having to fight media off of the church?”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s the latest skirmish in an ongoing war for control over the narrative around the measles outbreak, how the public should respond to it and the people who have lost children to the disease. Local public health officials, the state health department and leading epidemiologists have been encouraging vaccination to prevent measles' spread, while vaccine skeptics and the nation’s health secretary are downplaying the effects of the illness and platforming unconventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The mixed messaging is an added headache to local health departments — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/09/texas-public-health-federal-funding-cuts-pandemic/"&gt;expected cuts&lt;/a&gt; in the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;already meager&lt;/a&gt; public health resources — and threatens to push the end of the outbreak even further.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s just so tough to see all of this,” said Dr. Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center. “The misinformation is making it even more confusing [for parents] to make the right decision for their child.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the first three months of this year, 60% more measles-mumps-rubella vaccines were administered in the South Plains and Panhandle areas compared to the same time period last year, according to the state’s immunization registry that a minority of Texans opt into.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But, as some have sought more vaccinations, others seek dubious treatment methods. At least one Lubbock hospital has treated some pediatric measles patients for vitamin A toxicity after U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;promoted&lt;/a&gt; it. The steroid budesonide typically used for asthma and the antibiotic clarithromycin, both of which &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268"&gt;Kennedy touted&lt;/a&gt; for healing “300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” are not evidence-based treatments. And public health officials say they face escalating threats from conspiracy theorists sowing doubt about the MMR vaccine, the only effective way to prevent the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Two shots of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective in preventing the virus. Measles is most actively spreading in pockets of Texas where vaccination rates fall below 95%, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19"&gt;the threshold needed to build herd immunity&lt;/a&gt;. Gaines County’s kindergarten vaccination rate is about 82%.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The outbreak will continue until everyone who is susceptible has been infected or gets vaccinated, Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said during a press conference last week.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If people are forgoing the vaccine because they think these treatments will work for them, that’s misguided,” Adalja said. “The fact that they are being mentioned by Kennedy is tactical on his part.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="d75e6668-9340-44e7-bfeb-518a50f63769" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Recasting the measles deaths&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Malone is one of several medical practitioners who amassed a large online following during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he cast doubt on the safety of vaccines on podcast interviews, public demonstrations and on X, formerly Twitter, which at one point barred him for violating the platform’s misinformation policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;From his Virginia home, the infectious disease researcher has been watching the Texas measles outbreak with intense interest. He said in a phone interview with The Texas Tribune that media outlets choosing to highlight Texas’ outbreak among the many that are occurring worldwide is a “coordinated fear campaign.” And that campaign, he said, also aims to cast blame on Kennedy, who was confirmed as health secretary amid the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“There are statements that RFK was somehow responsible for the outbreak,” said Malone, who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/01/24/robert-malone-vaccine-misinformation-rogan-mandates/"&gt;Kennedy has defended against criticism&lt;/a&gt;. “This is political propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Malone said he received an anonymous tip about Daisy’s death and then learned more about her case from a doctor who was “close to the family.” Malone declined to name that doctor but said the physician was not involved directly with Daisy’s care at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Malone said he transcribed those doctors’ notes and published the transcription to his millions of Substack followers on Saturday, the day before Daisy’s funeral. “That was a hot take,” Malone said. “The wishes of the family were to get this alternative narrative out — the true narrative to counter the false narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hildebrand told the Tribune he didn’t want Daisy’s death revealed to the public before the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On the same day Malone broke the news of Daisy’s death, Kennedy’s staff was quickly scheduling an unannounced trip to Seminole, the county seat of Gaines County, to attend Daisy’s Sunday funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Gaines County, Kennedy raised doubts about the safety of the vaccine, telling Daisy’s father, “You don’t know what’s in the vaccine anymore,” &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/rfk-measles-grieving-families-texas/682386/"&gt;The Atlantic reported.&lt;/a&gt; Hildebrand told the Tribune he appreciated the secretary paying his respects to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It wasn’t until the day after Malone broke the news of Daisy’s death that health officials in Lubbock and the state offered a public statement confirming the child’s death by measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The child was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized,” the release from University Medical Center stated. “It is important to note that the child was not vaccinated against measles and had no known underlying health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By then, the campaign to plant doubt about what Texans were being told by the medical community about the two children’s deaths was already underway.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="258f5c15-2bde-4569-84ef-d233cc21d6e7" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Anti-vaccine group’s influence&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For months, Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Kennedy founded but stepped away from after becoming the nation’s health secretary, had been generating news articles and videos about measles, pointing to outbreaks in highly vaccinated communities and amplifying possible side effects of the MMR vaccine, which are generally mild.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Leaders of the organization’s broadcast arm visited Gaines County to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; the parents of six-year-old Kayley Fehr, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/26/texas-measles-death/"&gt;the first child to have died from measles in a decade&lt;/a&gt;. The Mennonite couple told CHD they stand by their decision to not vaccinate Kayley or their four surviving children who recovered from measles. CHD-TV Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker also casts doubt on Kayley's cause of death, insisting that she had a bacterial pneumonia that doctors could have treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;CHD’s video also lauded the work of Ben Edwards, a Lubbock doctor who CHD says has successfully treated many positive measles cases with unconventional therapies, including vitamin A, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/measles/measles-frequently-asked-questions"&gt;which can’t prevent measles but can be used as a supplemental treatmen&lt;/a&gt;t. Attempts to reach Edwards for comment were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By late March, Covenant Children’s Hospital had treated several unvaccinated measles patients who suffered from vitamin A toxicity. Some of those patients had reported using vitamin A to prevent measles, chief medical officer Dr. Lara Johnson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On the day of Daisy’s funeral, Kennedy posted on X &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268"&gt;a photo of himself&lt;/a&gt; with members of the Mennonite community along with Edwards and Odessa doctor Richard Bartlett, writing that both physicians have “treated and healed” Mennonite children using budesonide and clarithromycin. Neither method has been scientifically proven to successfully treat measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The following day, Children’s Health Defense uploaded a video with vaccine critic Pierre Kory, whose &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/doctors-accused-spreading-misinformation-lose-certifications/"&gt;medical certifications were revoked&lt;/a&gt; last year for spreading “false or inaccurate information,” claiming Daisy’s medical records show she died by medical error, not by measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“They are scaring people into getting a very dangerous vaccine and scaring people in what is a very benign case,” Kory says.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy later parrotted Kory’s claims in an exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch-rfk-jr-s-first-tv-interview-as-hhs-secretary/"&gt;CBS interview,&lt;/a&gt; saying Daisy died from a bacteriological infection and not measles. He also used the interview to plug his effort to get the CDC to study the risks of vaccines. Kennedy has repeatedly suggested there’s a link between vaccines and autism even though more than two dozen studies found no such connection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On Monday, CHD published &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/second-measles-death-father-speaks-out--the-peoples-study/"&gt;an interview &lt;/a&gt;with Daisy’s father who detailed how his daughter had been sick in recent weeks and worsened after a family trip to Mexico. Hildebrand said Daisy was initially diagnosed with strep and mononucleosis but sent home at least three times by three hospitals: first at Exceptional Community Hospital in Lubbock, then at nearby Covenant Children’s Hospital and finally, University Medical Center where she returned and died, Hildebrand told the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With prompting by CHD, Hildebrand agreed with the nonprofit group’s assessment that hospital physicians were too focused on her vaccination status and measles diagnosis and less on other causes that they believe led to her death, including a bacterial infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I feel that if they cared the way they should that my daughter would still be here,” Hildebrand told CHD-TV, adding that he does not believe his daughter died of measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The measles don’t kill people,” he said. “These foolish doctors are the ones that kill people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The two Lubbock hospitals declined to comment on Daisy’s case, citing patient privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="202b522e-9563-4a9a-9866-b286d7978440" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;How misinformation took hold in West Texas&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since the first measles cases were reported, there’s been little in the way of public statements from elected officials about it and the void has been quickly filled by those who believe vaccines are unsafe, like Children’s Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By late February, the number of cases had &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;hit the 124 mark&lt;/a&gt;, and a 6-year-old Mennonite girl, later identified as Kayley Fehr, had died. Still, Texas elected officials offered little &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/28/texas-measles-abbott-lawmakers-response/"&gt;reaction&lt;/a&gt; other than to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/03/texas-measles-house-public-health/"&gt;point the blame at undocumented immigrants crossing Texas’ southern border. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State health officials have not yet confirmed how measles arrived in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since the first measles death, state and federal staff and resources have been sent to the region to assist with vaccinations and testing. On most days, attendance at those clinics is minimal, according to local health officials. “I’ve driven by a few times and there’s nobody there,” said Collin McLarty, chief executive officer of Yoakum County Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Gaines County, where most of the cases have been reported, is also home to a large community of Old Colony Mennonites, a conservative religious group that speaks Plautdietsch, a Low German dialect. They do not &lt;a href="https://www.mennoniteusa.org/menno-snapshots/measles/"&gt;formally shun immunization&lt;/a&gt; but many do not opt to vaccinate. For decades, health officials in the region have had to rely on the members or former members of the religious community to help translate medical information for the group, making vaccination outreach even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Meanwhile, state funding for immunization and outreach — which is mostly performed by public health departments — has remained stagnant in Texas. According to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, Lubbock receives a $254,000 state grant each year for immunization efforts. That number has not increased in 15 years. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;Texas spent only $17 per person on public health,&lt;/a&gt; among the lowest in the country, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center. A decade ago, it was $19 per person.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Buoyed by the general public’s weariness with pandemic-era mandates, the state’s most politically active critic of vaccine mandates — Texans for Vaccine Choice — continues to strengthen. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Gov.,by%20the%20Texas%20Workforce%20Commission."&gt;More than a dozen bills&lt;/a&gt; it supports are before the Texas Legislature, including those that would make it easier for residents to obtain exemptions to required childhood vaccinations to attend schools, as well as measures that would put more requirements on medical professions before a vaccine is administered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="b205fa11-061f-43a6-8747-182fec298752" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Resident caught in the communication crossfire&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even residents in the outbreak area working to keep neighbors safe find themselves caught in the vaccine-choice crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On Feb. 25, the Gaines County Public Library posted a notice on its Facebook page asking their patrons to “kindly” remain at home if they had been exposed to measles or were unvaccinated. Within hours, vaccine critics, including Texans For Vaccine Choice President Rebecca Hardy, hurled criticism at the library.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“This is NOT okay” Hardy said on her own Facebook page, reposting the library’s notice. “Public services should be available to the entire public, regardless of their conscientious choices. Correct this immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Sabra Hall, the library’s director, was shocked at the backlash. She had the notice pulled down within five hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The majority of the comments were from people who didn’t even live here,” Hall said. “It blew my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nearby, the director of Andrews County Health Department Gordon Mattimoe, has faced similar backlash in recent weeks when he shared information on Facebook about vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You’ll have people from El Paso or faraway places that are just anti-vaxxers post comments to what we post,” Mattimoe said. “I try not to read the comments.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;On three separate occasions, Mattimoe said, he and his colleagues received threatening telephone messages from unknown callers who posit conspiracy theories that the MMR vaccine causes autism, a claim that study after study has debunked.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The misinformation feels like deja vu for Mattimoe, who recalled conspiracy theories thrown around online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Back then, Mattimoe would call out inaccurate Facebook posts and offer links to valid information.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But that’s too time consuming for battle-weary Mattimoe, who said he’s just letting things slide to focus on pushing out the truth and treating people who want his help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It can be discouraging,” he said. “But we keep our heads up.”&lt;/p&gt;

It also works with microelectrodes that penetrate the brain’s surface and non-invasive surface electromyography sensors placed on the face to measure muscle activity. These devices tap into the brain to measure neural activity, which the AI then learns to transform into the sounds of the patient's voice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuroprosthesis samples neural data from the brain's motor cortex, the area controlling speech production, and AI decodes that data into speech. According to study co-lead author Cheol Jun Cho, the neuroprosthesis intercepts signals where the thought is translated into articulation and, in the middle of that, motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-powered system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kaylo Littlejohn, Cheol Jun Cho, et al.

This "streaming approach brings the same rapid speech decoding capacity of devices like Alexa and Siri to neuroprostheses," according to Gopala Anumanchipalli, co-principal investigator &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01905-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;of the study&lt;/a&gt;. The model decodes neural data in 80-ms increments, enabling uninterrupted use of the decoder, further increasing speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naturalistic speech: &lt;/strong&gt;The technology aims to restore naturalistic speech, allowing for more fluent and expressive communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized voice: &lt;/strong&gt;The AI is trained using the patient's own voice before their injury, generating audio that sounds like them. In cases where patients have no residual vocalization, the researchers utilize a pre-trained text-to-speech model and the patient's pre-injury voice to fill in the missing details.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed and accuracy: &lt;/strong&gt;The system can begin decoding brain signals and outputting speech within a second of the patient attempting to speak, a significant improvement from the eight-second delay in a previous study from 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/what-is-ai-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-powered system&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kaylo Littlejohn, Cheol Jun Cho, et al.

In the 1940s, the Austrian psychiatrist Leo Kanner had coined the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/740316" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;controversial "refrigerator mother" theory&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that autism arose from early childhood trauma, created by mothers who were cold, uncaring and rejected their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Daniel Geschwind, a neuroscience and genetics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), says that this is now rightly recognised as being deeply damaging and wrong – but it took the better part of three decades for Kanner's theory to be debunked. It was not until 1977, when a couple of psychiatrists carried out &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1977.tb00443.x" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a landmark study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating that autism often runs in identical twins, that a more nuanced and accurate picture of autism's origins began to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That 1977 study was the first time that a genetic component of autism had been identified. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-019-09987-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Research has since shown&lt;/a&gt; that when one identical twin is autistic, the likelihood that the other twin will be too can be more than 90%. Meanwhile, the chances of fraternal twins of the same sex each sharing a diagnosis of autism are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4104233/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around 34%&lt;/a&gt;. These levels are substantially higher than the typical &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;rate of occurrence&lt;/a&gt; among the wider population, of around 2.8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is now widely accepted that there is a strong genetic component to autism. But which genes are involved and how their expression is influenced by other factors are only just starting to be unravelled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="tiny-differences" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="tiny-differences" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Tiny differences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even after the twin study in 1977, it would take several more decades for the full subtleties of the interaction between autism and the human genome to become apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Between any two individuals, the amount of genetic variation is around 0.1%, meaning that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20363" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;approximately one letter or base pair out of every 1,000&lt;/a&gt; in their DNA will be different. "Sometimes these variations have no effect at all," says Thomas Bourgeron, a neuroscience professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. "Sometimes they have a little effect, and sometimes they have a super strong effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Currently, "super strong" variations have been identified in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/docserver/fulltext/genet/58/1/annurev-genet-111523-102614.pdf?expires=1737804358&amp;amp;id=id&amp;amp;accname=guest&amp;amp;checksum=4D0BAC3B009C70D9E191504A807706B3" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;up to 20%&lt;/a&gt; of all cases of autism, with a single mutation in a single gene being largely responsible for driving critical neurodevelopmental differences. The role of these single gene mutations and how they arise is one of the most heavily studied areas in autism research, because as Bourgeron explains, they often result in severe and life-limiting disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4k9cm.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images For most autistic people, their neurodiversity is thought to arise from the combined action of thousands of different gene variants (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;For most autistic people, their neurodiversity is thought to arise from the combined action of thousands of different gene variants (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is not like the autism you see in the movies," Bourgeron says. "If you're born with one of these major mutations, there's a high likelihood you'll end up with intellectual disability or motor delay [the ability to coordinate muscle groups] or epileptic encephalopathy. It has a major impact on their quality of life and their family in most cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So far scientists have identified &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2215632120" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;at least 100 genes&lt;/a&gt; where these mutations can occur. Bourgeron himself made one of the first discoveries in March 2003 when he &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1136" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;identified two gene mutations&lt;/a&gt; linked to autism. Each impacted proteins involved in synaptogenesis, the process of forming connections between neurons in the brain. It was a major breakthrough, although it barely made a ripple in the media at the time, with Bourgeron recalling how former US President George W Bush had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/03/14/a-look-back-at-how-fear-and-false-beliefs-bolstered-u-s-public-support-for-war-in-iraq/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recently declared war&lt;/a&gt; on Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But more discoveries were to come, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17173049/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;mutations in the Shank3 gene&lt;/a&gt; which are estimated to occur in less than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3573207/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;1% of people with autism&lt;/a&gt;. We now know that some of these mutations are known as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00406/full" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants&lt;/a&gt;, which means that they occur through random chance in a developing embryo and aren't present in the blood DNA of either the mother or father. Geschwind describes &lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants as being akin to a "bolt of lightning", that is both unexpected and rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, in other cases, these mutations can have been passed on by one of the parents, even if both appear to be neurotypical, a more complex phenomenon which researchers have only begun to understand in the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You might wonder, if an autistic child has inherited a rare gene mutation from one of their parents, why doesn't the parent have autism too?" says Geschwind. "What seems to happen is that in the parent, it's not sufficient to be causal, but in the child, that major gene mutation combines additively with other, less individually impactful gene variants to drive neurodevelopment differences," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Of course, there are also thought to be environmental factors involved in the development of autism – even among identical twins where one has been diagnosed, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-019-09987-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;10% of the time&lt;/a&gt; the other one will not be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Historically, identifying the environmental factors behind autism has led to pseudoscientific beliefs such as the idea – &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/reel/video/p09zhlch/the-origins-of-one-of-the-biggest-frauds-in-the-world-" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;now widely debunked&lt;/a&gt; – that certain vaccines might be involved. Now the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has pledged a massive research effort to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0z9nmzvdlo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;identify the causes of autism&lt;/a&gt; before September 2025.

It appears that many of these genes become functional &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02408-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;during the formation of the cortex&lt;/a&gt; – the wrinkly outer layer of the brain responsible for many high-level functions, including memory, problem-solving and thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This critical part of brain development occurs in the foetus &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378378224001786" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;as it is developing in the womb&lt;/a&gt;, and according to Geschwind, peaks somewhere between 12 and 24 weeks. "You can think of these mutations as disrupting the normal patterns of development, knocking development off of its normal track so to speak and maybe onto another tributary, instead of the normal, neurotypical pattern of development," says Geschwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Because they cause such severe disability, the information about these gene mutations has enabled parents to form support groups, for example the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.scn2a.org/autism.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;FamilieSCN2A Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which serves as a community for families of autistic children where the autism diagnosis has been linked to a genetic change in the SCN2A gene. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37843780/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Discussions have also been&lt;/a&gt; held regarding the idea of using such genetic information to influence future reproductive decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If it's a &lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variant, then you can tell the parents that the risk would be low [of having another child with the same neurodevelopmental challenges], because there is a limited contribution from inherited factors, if they decided to have subsequent children," says Geschwind. "We can also give the family a sense of the spectrum of how their child might develop over time, and for parents of a two-year-old that's non-verbal and has some walking delay, they want to know what to expect." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while this can offer huge benefits for these families, the concept of genetic research is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11586462/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;not viewed with universal positivity&lt;/a&gt; across the autistic community. Autism is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a vast spectrum&lt;/a&gt;, ranging from those with severe impairments in physical and mental development which will never allow them to live independently, to others with far fewer support needs who view their autism as an identity and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6493410/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;advantage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8992913/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;oppose depictions&lt;/a&gt; of autism as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4kb1x.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images For many people, autism is just part of the broad spectrum of human experience – and not something to be treated (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;For many people, autism is just part of the broad spectrum of human experience – and not something to be treated (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Because of this, for some autistic people, their families and a number of academic researchers, the compilation of genetic data &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721223001167" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;has yielded ongoing concerns&lt;/a&gt; about how it might be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-complex-picture" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-complex-picture" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A complex picture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the past half century, genetics studies have shown that in the majority of autistic people, their neurodiversity arises through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3579743/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the additive effects&lt;/a&gt; of hundreds or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419308360" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;even thousands&lt;/a&gt; of relatively common gene variants which they have inherited from both parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These gene variants exist throughout the population of both neurotypical and neurodivergent people, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8477228/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the individual contribution of any one of these genes to neurodevelopment is negligible&lt;/a&gt;. But in combination, they have a significant effect on the wiring of the brain. Bourgeron says that it is not uncommon for one or both parents, who carry some of these gene variants, to display autistic traits such as a preference for order, difficulties in detecting emotions, and being hyperaware of patterns; but unlike their child, these traits do not manifest to such a significant degree that they themselves could be diagnosed as autistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Over the last 20 years, autism researchers have devised some ingenious ways of identifying some of these more subtle variants. In the early 2000s, Simon Baron-Cohen, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, devised a test called &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2001_BCetal_adulteyes.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Reading the Mind in the Eyes.&lt;/a&gt; This is intended to assess a person's ability to detect emotions such as looking playful, comforting, irritated or bored – based on a photograph which shows only the person's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The idea is that poorer performance on the test indicates a higher likelihood of a person being autistic. "Autistic individuals have a different way of looking at the face, and they seem to get more information from a person's mouth," says Bourgeron. "Neurotypical individuals get more information from the eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;More recently, in partnership with the DNA testing site 23andMe, which agreed to host the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test on their website, Bourgeron and Baron-Cohen &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28584286/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;were able to gather data&lt;/a&gt; on the abilities of more than 88,000 people to read thoughts and emotions from a person's eyes, and compare this performance with their genetic information. Through this dataset, they were able to identify large groups of gene variants associated with poorer emotion recognition, many of which are thought to be carried by autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other research studies have found that common gene variants associated with autism &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.30.21262845v4.full" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;tend to be&lt;/a&gt; negatively correlated with empathy or social communication. But they are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6722082" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;positively correlated&lt;/a&gt; with the ability to analyse and construct systems as well as rules and routines. Most intriguingly, they are also often linked to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8743131/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;higher educational attainment&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4927579/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;greater spatial or mathematical or artistic abilities&lt;/a&gt;. "This perhaps explains why these genetic variants, which come from very distant ancestors, have remained in the population throughout human history," says Geschwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Geschwind and Baron-Cohen are now embarking on a project to try to understand whether some of the common gene variants linked with autism can explain why autism &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114757/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;seems to be more prevalent in men&lt;/a&gt;, and why autistic women are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10060524/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;thought to be more adept&lt;/a&gt; at masking their neurodivergent traits compared with autistic men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The likelihood is that differences in male and female brain development and function make the men more susceptible and the women protected from the genetic susceptibility to autism to some degree, but we don't fully understand that yet," says Geschwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, some experts believe that autism may be much more common in women than is currently thought, and that the experiences of this group are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/NDT.S372723" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;being overlooked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Autism isn't a biological phenomenon that has to be tested for, and where you get a categorical outcome or prognosis – Sue Fletcher-Watson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Geschwind suggests that understanding sex differences in autism could help identify protective factors which could be used as future treatments, yet this very concept remains deeply divisive and reflective of one of the core underlying tensions within autism research. While some scientists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/horizon-magazine/autism-cures-may-be-closer-focus-turns-early-treatment" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;pursue treatments&lt;/a&gt;, other researchers and some autistic people believe that autism is not a disorder to be fixed, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10074754/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;an identity and a shared experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Autism isn't a biological phenomenon that has to be tested for, and where you get a categorical outcome or prognosis," says Sue Fletcher-Watson, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Edinburgh. "It isn't something, like cancer, that is universally agreed to be bad and for which everyone wants a cure. In my opinion, it never will be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In particular, Fletcher-Watson says that many autistic people fear that the ultimate outcome of autism genetic research will be a prenatal test, which could pose an existential threat to autism. Beginning in 2005, one activist created &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-8437-0_9" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the Autistic Genocide Clock&lt;/a&gt;, stating that if such a test existed, it would represent a continuation of historic attempts to eliminate minority groups. Two decades later, such fears remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Genetic researchers on the whole have done little to listen to, and address, the fears of the autistic community regarding security and future use of genetic data," says Fletcher-Watson. These fears are heightened by political contexts, she says, such as the strength of certain far-right parties, which make the possibility of eugenic use of genetic data seem much more real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prenatal tests are already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/your-pregnancy-care/screening-for-downs-edwards-pataus-syndrome/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;established practice in the UK&lt;/a&gt; for conditions caused by having an extra copy of a chromosome in some or all of the body’s cells.

"These are different things," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To try and better stratify the broad spectrum of autistic traits, the Lancet Commission &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01541-5/abstract" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;formally recognised&lt;/a&gt; the term "profound autism" in 2021, as a way of describing autistic people who are unable to advocate for themselves and are likely to require 24-hour support throughout their lives. Since then, a variety of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06662188?term=Jaguar%20Gene%20Therapy&amp;amp;rank=1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have begun, all using various therapeutic strategies to try and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10886956/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;target the single genes&lt;/a&gt; underpinning physical and intellectual disability in different individuals with profound autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The main idea for these treatments surrounds the fact that all of us have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/minute-to-understanding/what-is-an-allele" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;two copies or alleles, or variants, of every single gene&lt;/a&gt;, one from each parent. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.13.584921v1" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from Geschwind's lab leveraged the understanding that most of the &lt;i id="de-novo" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; gene mutations linked with profound autism only knock out one of these copies, suggesting it might be possible to reduce the degree of disability by boosting the unaffected copy. "That means you have one unaffected copy, [the activity of which] which we showed could be turned up to compensate," says Geschwind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bourgeron has recently been running &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmsf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Effects-of-Lithium-in-Patients-With-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-and-Phelan-McDermid-Syndrome.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a clinical trial using the metal lithium&lt;/a&gt; to boost a version of the Shank3 gene in autistic children who are known to have Shank3 mutations. In the future, Geschwind suggests that a technology such as Crispr, which allows scientists to edit a person's DNA, could be used to intervene at an even earlier stage of life. For example, gene therapy could be delivered to unborn babies found to have various mutations, while they are still in the womb. "We've recently figured out a way of doing this," he says. "It might not fully correct the impacted gene, but it could at least partially correct it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The FDA has recently granted approval for the US-based biotechnology company Jaguar Gene Therapy &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jaguargenetherapy.com/press-release/jaguar-gene-therapy-to-initiate-inaugural-pediatric-clinical-trial-targeting-a-genetic-form-of-autism-spectrum-disorder-and-phelan-mcdermid-syndrome/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to run a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; where a gene therapy is administered to autistic children with a Shank3 gene mutation along with a co-occurring genetic condition called Phelan-McDermid syndrome which affects development, speech and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This trial is only possible because all the children participating have genetic diagnoses," says Buxbaum. "And because researchers at Mount Sinai and elsewhere have spent the past 15 years studying how these children develop when they have these mutations. We can then use this natural history data as a control in the study."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while such trials could undoubtedly result in enormous benefits for the children involved and their families, Fletcher-Watson is still sceptical about their depiction as therapies for autism, profound or otherwise. She would prefer to see them characterised as treatments for intellectual disability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I believe that when people talk about these single-gene cases of autism, they are being disingenuous," says Fletcher-Watson. "They are talking about single-gene causes of intellectual disability, perhaps many of whom are also autistic. But there is funding available for research to address autism, active parent campaign groups and all sorts of resources, in a way that there is not for intellectual disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, Fletcher-Watson is more optimistic about the potential of genetic research to devise novel treatments for some of the co-occurring conditions with which autistic people are often diagnosed, including &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1525505019304949" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/jopn/fulltext/2015/10040/autism_and_sleep_disorders.2.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-017-0846-y" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;OCD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/fulltext/2014/03000/gastrointestinal_issues_in_autism_spectrum.5.aspx" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;gastrointestinal disorders&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bourgeron now coordinates &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.r2d2-mh.eu/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a European project&lt;/a&gt; on risk, resilience and developmental diversity in mental health, collaborating with autistic people and their families to better understand why autism rarely comes in isolation, and what makes different individuals prone to these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, Bourgeron says that we also need to better recognise neurodiversity and reduce stigma relating to autism. "I think that for us as geneticists we need to go back to the needs of each person" he says. "Some autistic individuals with Shank3 mutations are so severely impacted that they need round the clock care. For others, they might only need specific support at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Overall, we need to do a better job of recognising neurodiversity, and doing everything we can to make sure that people who function differently from the majority can flourish in our societies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:05:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPTFNLQUg0MHJMdkd0T0FBMzRCc1I1eGVVS1RXYkVVY0xGX0taazVuQjV1MGpHc0p3RFdib3M2Q29TQXVqejIzWi1SZE5fUV9lQUd1ZkZyTjlYUzJsbWhwblNSY2cwNkpuMElLTVVjYmtCR09abEdZZXhVWTRvcDZUQS1PcWZMTWJWNV9ablh6OFM2alBBMGZ4UlhpUDczQQ</guid></item><item><title>芬太尼死亡缓慢，冰毒来到缅因州--《纽约时报》 | As Fentanyl Deaths Slow, Meth Comes for Maine - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5uRmo1NjhXLWFWMmZUNE9IVWNoQldraTMtaGNSSVMwdkd1Sks3cmZnMkN3VnhBd2dDbWwtSDJjT2YtTVVMdFpQS1RYcGdwdkFsQ3BPel9YRDZ1a2VsVnZ0VW9QYWM4c0YyZFlwcUQ5UzF2d011?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Something worrisome was happening at Spurwink, a mental health clinic in Portland, Maine.

Two unvaccinated children in Texas and an unvaccinated &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; have died. The adult tested positive for measles, but the official cause of death is still under investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist leading the CDC’s measles response, said Tuesday at a meeting of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee that more than 90% of the cases are “related to the Southwest outbreak, driven by transmission in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.” The other cases have largely been imported from other countries, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We do believe that there’s quite a large amount of cases that are not reported and underreported,” Sugerman said Tuesday as he updated the committee on measles. “In working very closely with our colleagues in Texas; in talking with families, they may mention prior cases that have recovered and never received testing, other families that may have cases and never sought treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sugerman said the CDC has deployed 15 people to Texas to help manage the outbreak and is sending seven more this week. It continues to make measles vaccines available to health departments at their request, he said, and it is helping standardize and expand wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;slashed $11.4 billion in Covid funding&lt;/a&gt; last month, some of which helped state health departments respond to disease outbreaks. Sugerman said the loss of Covid grant money has created “funding limitations” in Texas, where state officials are redirecting staffers to work on the measles response or moving them from other regions to help support efforts in the outbreak area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Sugerman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 561 cases had been confirmed in the West Texas outbreak, according to the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Each measles case may cost $30,000 to $50,000 to address, which “adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before this year, the United States had not had a measles death in a decade, and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm#" target="_blank"&gt;child had not died of measles&lt;/a&gt; since 2003. Many public health experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s approach&lt;/a&gt; to the outbreak. While Kennedy has called for people to get the measles vaccine, he has framed vaccination as a personal choice and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; like steroids or antibiotics. He has also repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;, despite robust evidence that two doses of the vaccine offer lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At a media event Tuesday in Indiana, Kennedy said the CDC has “done a very good job at controlling the measles outbreak,” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/rfk-jr-pushes-fluoride-policy-review-cites-autism-concerns-237047877801" target="_blank"&gt;pointing to higher case numbers in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. However, the figure he cited — 127,000 cases — was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank"&gt;the total last year across 53 countries&lt;/a&gt;. Disease experts say that is an apples-to-oranges comparison with the current outbreak in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy also suggested Tuesday that “healthy children should not die of measles” if doctors know how to treat it. In reality, no specific treatment is approved for measles, and unvaccinated children are vulnerable to severe complications, such as pneumonia and swelling of the brain. Roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee met Tuesday for the first time since Kennedy took office on Feb. 13. The meeting was originally scheduled for late February, but &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" target="_blank"&gt;the Department of Health and Human Services postponed it&lt;/a&gt;. A senior HHS spokesperson said at the time that the delay was intended to allow time for public comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has previously &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/newly-sworn-in-hhs-secretary-rfk-jr-vows-tackle-physical-well-spiritual-crisis-country" target="_blank"&gt;accused the committee members&lt;/a&gt; of having conflicts of interest, citing ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Most scientists say it is appropriate for members to accept industry funding for vaccine research, as long as it is disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Helen Keipp Talbot, who chaired the committee Tuesday, lamented that the group had to discuss rising measles case numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I find it absolutely devastating that we’re having this update today,” she said. “There’s no reason why we have healthy children dying of measles in the U.S. when this vaccine is amazing. It’s highly effective and has a very long-lasting immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNT1U3NlM3UG53MWY0TWt5ZDZ0SjVpZENjandDaTl1RU42NzRSQU83aXF2NC1pSGxqM25RWC1oZFotbUYxdHNZOWN5Wi1oUGxac1Bkc2FPU3ZfWDl4TzNpZkNUai1UaU1pNUdZT2k2NE53NTBxb1lTZF9sOXE2TVBBcmMtc08xMzVleXdJd3RkVUZSUGVXa3hGZ9IBVkFVX3lxTFBFOVlhUXUxTVo5dXEwWlgtQ0NydHdxRzlET2tqdHRka2RTUXBOUVVNSm4xTmdob1JMclhxS0hBaDc1cl94c0VfNnpBT21PeHdZTWdFOUdR</guid></item><item><title>狩猎纽约市的野生蘑菇-《纽约时报》 | Hunting the Wild Mushrooms of New York City - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE9hdHFVTC11eDcycmd4NEJYVk1oN2p0Wl9ha3Z6ZmdKZEdOT1VqVWUwZHNrMklSM1Z2TEl0UEJjamFhelhMWFZGM2VscmFoVDRJM2diRTREYUJiOVgyWFZZVmdKZWw3dEFqRkQxX1VYWW0xSGUzWUVkRGszN2I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;New York City can be a place of almost incomprehensible abundance.

			&lt;p&gt;Medications designed to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by lowering blood sugar levels, like Ozempic, continue to turn up added benefits, and protection from dementia may soon be added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists are a particular class of glucose-lowering drugs that can significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;improve heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-reveals-ozempic-lowers-risk-of-diabetic-kidney-disease"&gt;kidney health&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, and recent studies suggest they could also &lt;a href="http://sciencealert.com/type-2-diabetes-drug-linked-to-35-lower-dementia-risk-in-patients"&gt;reduce dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's an appealing prospect when an estimated 6.9 million US adults are living with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and related dementias today &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;a number that is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13809"&gt;expected to more than double&lt;/a&gt; by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/diabetes"&gt;diabetes is a risk factor for dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and that people with diabetes are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9812-diabetes-and-stroke"&gt;more likely to experience strokes&lt;/a&gt; from blood clots in the brain, which are known to sometimes result in &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dementia/vascular-dementia"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"But whether glucose-lowering therapies can help prevent cognitive decline has remained unclear," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079757"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Catriona Reddin, a medical researcher from the University of Galway. "Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists, in particular, may have a protective effect on brain health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study Reddin worked on was led by University of Galway medical students Allie Seminer and Alfredi Mulihano. A second, separate study from a University of Florida team was led by &lt;span&gt;epidemiologist &lt;/span&gt;Huilin Tang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams studied how glucose-lowering drugs with cardiovascular benefits, like GLP-1 agonists and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGLT2_inhibitor"&gt;SGLT2 inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, were associated with risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, specifically in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminer's team analyzed the results of 26 randomized clinical trials, equating to more than 160,000 participants, which compared dementia diagnoses or cognitive scores among people who took glucose-lowering therapies, and those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found people who used GLP-1RAs had a 45 percent lower risk of all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment, though this was not the case for those using &lt;span&gt;SGLT2is&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on closer inspection of dementia subtypes, these therapies had no association with lowering &lt;span&gt;vascular dementia, Alzheimer disease, or Lewy body dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;This is surprising because we would expect first-line cardioprotective glucose-lowering therapies, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;like GLP1-RAs and SGLT2is, which reduce cardiovascular dis- ease risk, to also decrease the risk of vascular dementia," University of California San Francisco medical doctor Diana Thiara &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831981"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in an editorial published alongside the papers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study, led by Tang, was a target trial emulation using records from &lt;span&gt;396,963 patients with type 2 diabetes. The researchers analyzed the risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias, comparing results for people who used GLP-1RAs and those taking &lt;span&gt;SGLT2is or other kinds of glucose-lowering therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study found  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="157835" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; risk reductions in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias among people who used cardioprotective glucose-lowering therapies, regardless of whether they were &lt;span&gt;GLP-1RAs or SGLT2is. This was not the case for other kinds of glucose-lowering therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results support the potential neuroprotections of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is and highlight their possible role in Alzheimer's and related dementia prevention strategies," Tang and team &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831976"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiara points out that both papers were limited by short follow-up durations, low dementia rates, confounding factors that muddy observational studies, and the broad strokes taken in classifying these drugs, which may contain different active ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"W&lt;span&gt;ith the advent of more potent GLP-1RAs, like semaglutide, it is crucial to study these newer medications individually rather than grouping them with older drugs in the same class, as their effects may differ significantly," she &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831981"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers are published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831976"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Depression is becoming more common among adults and adolescents in the United States, but most are not getting therapy to help, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00043b6o2k64woud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1 in 8 people ages 12 and up in the US have been depressed in recent years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db527.htm" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. Depression prevalence has nearly doubled, from 7.3% in 2015-16 to more than 13% in 2021-23.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00053b6opelhwd1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are based on results from a federal survey – most recently conducted between August 2021 and August 2023 – in which participants reported whether they had had certain symptoms associated with depression in the previous two weeks. Responses to these validated screening questions were scored to determine whether the individuals had depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j8yam000023b6o9uws7jui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the administration of the survey, and modifications that were made once it resumed – including changes to the way it was administered – may have affected the ability to most accurately track changes over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j8zmw100063b6o64q26p42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are less likely to report conditions that could potentially be considered socially undesirable in face-to-face interviews than they are in phone or online interviews, and changes in that method could account for increases, Dr. Renee Goodwin, a psychiatric epidemiologist and clinical psychologist with Columbia University, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00063b6o1xwvlt44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, experts have long said that the pandemic&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;exacerbated mental health challenges for many in the US – 90% of adults have said that the country is facing a mental health crisis, according to a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/health/cnn-kff-mental-health-poll-wellness/index.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from CNN in partnership with KFF – but experts have also said that awareness around mental health has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j92kmc000a3b6o51ex0ao6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Matt Mishkind, deputy director of the Johnson Depression Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, says that researchers have been trying to figure out why depression rates have been growing for the past decade or so – and at least part of it has to do with decreasing stigma around talking about mental health in some groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j99w2j000f3b6ohslbxr84@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The question then is, has that truly increased, or have we just been able to identify it more? I definitely think it has increased, and I think that’s because I think the world is a difficult place right now,” he said. “I think there’s been stressor after stressor after stressor for a long time now, and I think that is starting to truly affect people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00073b6ozkfwe6gf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC data, women are more likely than men to have depression, and prevalence tends to decrease with age and greater wealth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00083b6otfkmkcsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, about 16% of women and 10% of men had depression during the 2021-23 survey period. But more than 1 in 4 adolescent girls between ages 12 and 19 had depression, the data shows, higher than any other demographic group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da00093b6ope79rkny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the CDC’s latest Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that more than half of high school girls (53%) said they felt persistently sad or hopeless – nearly twice the rate of share of boys (28%) who said the same and 14 percentage points higher than a decade earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000a3b6o5wyxcy7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Girls are more verbal and vocal about some of their challenges, traditionally; boys are not as much, although I think that is changing,” Dr. Jill Emanuele, vice president of clinical training at the Child Mind Institute in New York City, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/health/teen-mental-health-cdc-wellness/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; in August. She was not involved in any of the CDC reports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000b3b6outqis0ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of adults and adolescents with depression in the latest survey – nearly 88% – said that symptoms had created difficulties for them in work, at home or with social activities, and about a third of those said it was “very to extremely difficult.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000c3b6ozezzfg8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But only about 40% of adults and adolescents with depression received counseling or therapy, the new CDC report shows. Women were more likely than men to have received therapy: about 43%, compared with 33%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000d3b6okyl8824u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adult women are also more than twice as likely as adult men to take medication for depression, according to another CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db528.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday. In 2023, about 11.4% of US adults took a prescription medication for depression – but that breaks out to more than 15% of women and 7.4% of men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000e3b6olhfsv6qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite higher rates of depression in younger age groups, the new CDC reports show that middle-age people were more likely than younger adults to take prescription medication for depression. More than 12% of adults between ages 45 and 74 did so in 2023, compared with less than 11% of adults ages 18 to 44.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000f3b6o9x0fbnvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has specifically targeted a certain class of antidepressant drugs in recent comments. At his Senate confirmation this year, he &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/health/rfk-jr-antidepressants-addictive-wellness/index.html"&gt;falsely suggested&lt;/a&gt; that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, may be more addictive than heroin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000g3b6o8cl3kztu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; for the Make America Healthy Again commission – which Kennedy will lead – specifically plans to address an assessment of the “prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors” for children, along with other mental health medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000h3b6o7num9g5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in February, health care data and analytics company Truveta analyzed information from its database of millions of electronic health records to understand whether increased awareness around mental health has led to increases in people seeking medication or concerns around overprescribing or dependency on antidepressant medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000i3b6oqeieg8rz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It found that trends in &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/mental-health-prescribing-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;prescriptions for mental health&lt;/a&gt; have remained relatively stable since 2018. Rates ticked up in the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic but have since dropped to levels from 2018 or lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000j3b6ogq92xjtn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed mental health medication – with SSRIs accounting for nearly half – but Truveta found trends in prescribing rates to be much steadier than the CDC found in trends for depression prevalence. And the findings do not suggest that over-rescribing mental health medications should be a concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000k3b6oclz8jsl8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While increased mental health awareness and the heightened demand for care during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to shifts in prescribing rates, our findings suggest that overall trends in mental health prescriptions have remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations in recent years,” Truveta researchers wrote in a blog post.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9j0n0da000l3b6orszvh5yi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While there was a slight increase in the rate of mental health prescriptions during the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent stabilization and decrease suggests that the rise was likely a temporary response to heightened mental health needs rather than a long-term shift toward higher prescribing rates.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — A new report from Harris County Health shows cases of &lt;a href="/article/news/health/breakthrough-hiv-prevention-join-the-discussion-on-prep-on-khou-11/285-321bdc5f-8385-4cc0-97ff-62da54c59090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and other sexually transmitted infections are rising throughout the &lt;a href="/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Houston area at a faster rate&lt;/a&gt; than any other place in Texas. The rates of new infections are even rising among diseases you may have forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia all of them," says Legacy Health's director of health navigation, Jill Jahns. "It's a big issue we have here in our community. Harris County and Houston in particular have been surpassing the rates of STIs in Texas."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the lag for required reporting, the most recent data in the report covers the time period between 2016 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Between 2016 and 2022, the rates of syphilis in our community doubled," Jahns says. "Which is definitely concerning."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report includes a map of the zip codes where the rate of syphilis is the highest. The parts of the Houston area with the highest rates are: Downtown, Montrose and the OST area, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For chlamydia, the highest rates of new cases are located in the Medical Center area, La Porte and Downtown.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ages we're seeing it the highest is ages 15 through 24," Jahns said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows gonorrhea has an infection rate that is surging in the Medical Center area, followed by Downtown and then Sunnyside.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest rates of new HIV cases were seen in Montrose, followed by the Second Ward and then Settegast.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the sexually transmitted infections are found in basically every demographic in Harris County, the study found there is one population that is testing positive for them at a faster rate than others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Particularly Black women," Jahns said. "Black women who are heterosexual are frequently getting STIs at a higher rate than other groups."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start is from a position of knowledge. &lt;a href="https://www.legacycommunityhealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Legacy Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free and confidential HIV and STI testing and some results are returned in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Houston's most prevalent STIs can be treated with medication, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/breakthrough-hiv-prevention-join-the-discussion-on-prep-on-khou-11/285-321bdc5f-8385-4cc0-97ff-62da54c59090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;including HIV, which no longer has to deliver a death sentence&lt;/a&gt;. Houston's HIV positive patients are given medication at Legacy Health to not only survive but also drugs that keep the active virus in their bodies low enough, to protect somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Stangland says it has numerous functions in our body and comes with many benefits. Optimal vitamin D levels are essential for systemic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It regulates cellular growth and gene expression (essential for cancer prevention), improves cell differentiation, and is involved in immunity, fertility, muscle strength, hormone balance, sexual health, energy, mood, and more,” adds &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/rhianstephenson/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rhian Stephenson&lt;/a&gt;, nutritionist, naturopath, and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://artah.co/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://artah.co/"}' href="https://artah.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Artah&lt;/a&gt;. Put simply, it’s essential for all-around health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens if you’re vitamin D deficient?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency impacts both physical and mental health. When vitamin D is low, Stangland explains that there is decreased absorption of calcium and phosphorus into the bones, which puts you at risk of bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-vitamin-d"&gt;Low levels&lt;/a&gt; are also linked to poor immunity and increased risk of serious health conditions such as cancer. “Vitamin D has been shown to play a role in cancer prevention and treatment,” she explains. “[It] inhibits cell proliferation in cancerous tissues and also downregulates certain cells involved in inflammatory signaling in cancer.” Other poor outcomes include autoimmune conditions, COVID-19, hormone health, and mood disorders, Stephenson. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, fibromyalgia, and neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, are all also linked to vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who eat a vegan diet or who have celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and cystic fibrosis are particularly at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Others who are at risk are babies who are breastfed, older adults, those with dark skin tones, and those who weigh above their standard body mass index (BMI). According to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;, breast milk’s vitamin D levels are lower than the required amounts and also dependent on the mother’s vitamin D levels. When it comes to older people or those with darker skin tones, the NIH explains that our skin has a harder time synthesizing vitamin D as we age or if we have melanin in the epidermal layer that reduces the skin’s ability to do so. Those who may be dealing with excess fat won’t necessarily have a problem absorbing vitamin D, but the NIH says that they will need more of it to be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to truly know if you are vitamin D deficient is to have a blood test via your general practitioner. However, there are also signs and symptoms you can look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a severe vitamin D deficiency, one of the most common symptoms is a feeling of chronic, profound, or irremediable fatigue. To add to that, poor sleep is another symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Bone and muscle pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and frequent muscle pain and weakness. Meanwhile, bone and joint pain are common, as vitamin D is essential for the body to absorb calcium—without it, increased fragility and pain may occur. So for the sake of your bone health, vitamin D is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Hair loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s essential for healthy hair that grows optimally. A deficiency can cause hair to fall out or slow growth because a deficiency intervenes with a follicle’s life cycle. Alopecia is also believed to be related to vitamin D insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;You’re often sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a weak immune system. If you’re often ill and don’t know why, consider getting a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Depression, anxiety, and mood disorders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research shows that vitamin D may play a key role in balancing our mood and minimizing the risk of depression. Low levels can contribute to seasonal affective disorder and are often associated with feelings of being overwhelmed, sadness, anxiety, forgetfulness, and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you get vitamin D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serotonin-vitamin-d-daylight" target="_blank"&gt;sunlight exposure&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way to stimulate the production of vitamin D in the body, which is why we’re particularly vulnerable to deficiency in the dark winter months. “The NHS recommends supplementing with vitamin D3 throughout autumn and the winter months for this reason,” explains Stephenson. Stangland recommends getting at least 20 minutes of sun exposure to keep vitamin D levels at a healthy amount. (Just be sure to always &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vogue-editors-sunscreen" target="_blank"&gt;wear sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; to protect your skin from sun damage and to prevent skin cancer.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:26:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE96UWlpQWdrN2RQLW9EaHpVTXQwNE5qaktnZmVabnk4dGR1QzItYU16cTEwSDVEVEVGeGNPaTZ6Y05YajNDelR5dW1XR3prdk9tLVBuLW9xcmF3dXN4TDhz</guid></item><item><title>Waverly社区集会支持17岁儿童死于流感、链球菌并发症的家庭- 10tv.com | Waverly community rallies to support family after 17-year-old dies from flu, strep complications - 10tv.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxPMW1rSFYzMlNuV2xCZXdYQzRNUmNHTGxvd2xLMDZlWnphODV2ZjR0QUEtY1NMcTcxWkxXZm5hdXRyX1ZrQVRjZDFITFZPOUtlV2dWaFZJNU5WcU9QTXRNcEJnT2ZCNS1NTTNoQUtXRTBMN0lsSEZsWVBYTjhFYm9VQUtWcDc4MFFHRmNEWmFmVE12SFE5bnVQdWJoNU8yYVhlbUZuMnM0MjZLbXlibll6MjZpbHlaQWQ4LVdka0hTaml5YmlJUktTU1JfVE9NVmR1WEpJWEhNbFlndUV5V3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Waverly mourns senior Jocey Tackett, who died from flu complications.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WAVERLY, Ohio — The Waverly High School community received the news this week that one of their own passed away after weeks in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, 17-year-old Jocey Tackett had been admitted to the hospital with the flu and suffered complications from the flu and strep that turned septic and caused too much damage for her body to recover, according to her family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She passed away on Sunday at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, just a few days before she would have turned 18.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocey was a senior at Waverly High School.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waverly City Schools shared a statement saying it was saddened about her passing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our thoughts and condolences are with her family and all who were her friends. This is a very devastating and delicate situation, so out of respect and love for the family we did not want to schedule or release information that would possibly conflict with the family’s plans or wishes for privacy during this difficult time," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school will have counselors available in the high school auditorium from noon to 2 p.m. on April 17 for any students in need of additional support.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school is also planning on having the administration and staff meet with the high school student body in the auditorium on April 21.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the tragic loss, the small town community is working to support Jocey’s family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 22, Giovanni’s Pizza of Piketon and Cardo’s in Lucasville will donate half their proceeds to the Tacketts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giovanni’s owner Amanda Little wanted to do something to help.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a really small community here that comes together in hard times. Devastating losses such as this are taken to heart by everyone, the death of anyone — especially a child — is just really heartbreaking,” Little said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little said she has known Jocey for most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She had a big personality and didn’t let the opinions of others influence her life. She was really passionate about animals, especially horses, she showed at the 4-H at our county fair for many years and she had planned to attend college and study zoology as well.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocey’s mother suggests honoring her by giving blood or donating to an animal shelter.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health could not comment specifically on Tackett, but shared there have been four flu related deaths in Ohio during the 2024-2025 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting an annual flu shot is the best way to protect yourself against the flu. ODH especially encourages parents to protect their children by ensuring they are up to date on their flu shot. Washing your hands frequently, covering any coughs or sneezes and staying home when you’re sick will also help prevent the spread of flu to others.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

which allows "seamless shared care and decision making" between her, her private specialist consultant, and her GP "in relation to medicines use".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was able to manage all the things that I need to do every day like picking up the child from school, cooking a dinner, tidying up round me, looking after the garden, walking the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It made such a difference that I finally felt more like myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Cousins said she loves the fact she has ADHD because she said many people are creative as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She writes songs and poetry, and has recently written a book about her childhood, educating about the signs, symptoms, and behaviours of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Sarah Salters from ADD-NI said the lack of services for adults is "diabolical"&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://adhduk.co.uk/the-history-of-adhd/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;ADHD was first recognised in adults in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, eight years after childhood ADHD was formally recognised through National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in most of the UK NHS (England, Wales, and NI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The DoH said whilst a level of provision is available, it is aware that "this has also led to inconsistencies between trusts".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sarah Salters, CEO of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://addni.org/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;ADD-NI&lt;/a&gt;, said the charity receives a high number of weekly referrals for ADHD support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since January they have had 165 referrals, with almost half of those for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the lack of services within the health service for adults is "diabolical", leaving adults "very frustrated" with "nowhere to turn".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Salters said many people are "forced" to go private for a diagnosis and also have difficulty getting medication as not all GPs honour the shared care protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"About 4% of our adult population have ADHD, that's about 70,000 people across Northern Ireland and there's possibly a very high number of people who are undiagnosed," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Where you get the right support, the proper strategies in place, people with ADHD start to see that they can do things that they weren't capable of doing before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The DoH has commissioned a "needs assessment" with a view to bringing forward recommendations to inform a commissioned ADHD service, which is expected to be completed by the end of June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It said any decision "will be based on an assessment of the level of demand for services, and in the context of future budget availability".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Salters is not confident services will be commissioned as she does not think ADHD is seen as a "priority".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 23:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5pOWhxYzZ6SEhqSlAyQzQ3UnMydmFzY2t0SXpnM0R2Z1VjdVdhcDJxT1NMUlo0TUFwU2x2RVFhdEU1dnp0RGM3d3RSRHZXcHgyX1pLTWZmMHV5Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE4wTzVNYTVFRWpINkpVazJXcnR2bV8tTkg3cXhsQTg2U2tTMnZzekpFTWEwSlVMX3hIOHRGbGhleFNmNURyLUxidnpnV3ZzVGRwWkZTY2tWby1PWmtPNmpV</guid></item><item><title>随着病例增加，现在多纳安娜县出现麻疹- KOAT | Measles now in Dona Ana County as cases increase - KOAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZWdlNkRBTXIzb0p6WnE0VmhLMi1rcms0TXB6cHlEYTh3WGRmV0YtYy1YcXlNM2NfQWVGNWdnOGdJanFoV09GUEpsLWY3VXItMXczTTBuY3V1bEtmY18yQ19fT1FtZnJQbVU1d3dfT3JGMGJkc3o4S2xXX1Z2QzhjTzI0S2ZLRnM0TmppbE1Xbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						Measles has been diagnosed in an unvaccinated child in Dona Ana County, making it the first reported case there, a New Mexico Department of Health news release said.Dona Ana County residents may have been exposed to measles earlier this month in Las Cruces at the Kid's Kountry Place Preschool and Childcare and the Memorial Medical Center's Family Medicine Center, Emergency Department and Pediatric Unit.  There are now 63 cases of measles in New Mexico, counting four new cases in Lea County of people who have not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease has also been reported in Chaves and Eddy counties. With the number of cases increasing, the NMDOH is recommending that the MMR vaccine be given to infants from 6-11 months old who live in Dona Ana County, or will be traveling to Dona Ana and Lea counties.At the same time, the number of people getting vaccinations to prevent measles has almost doubled from Feb. 1 to April 4 over the same period last year — from 9,863 to 18,449 , the release said.Information on measles symptoms, and guidance from nurses, is available on the NMDOH helpline at 1-833-796-8773 and online at measles.doh.nm.gov.

Just over 6.5% of participants had a slow walking pace, 53% had an average walking pace and 41% had a brisk walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Tracking these individuals for an average of 13 years showed that 36,574 participants (9%) developed some form of heart rhythm abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for background demographic and lifestyle factors, an average or brisk walking pace was associated with, respectively, a 35% and 43% lower risk of all heart rhythm abnormalities compared with a slow walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These higher walking speeds were also associated with lower risks of atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the amount of time spent walking at a slow pace was not associated with the risk of developing heart rhythm abnormalities, more time spent walking at an average or brisk pace was associated with a 27% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Overall, around 36% of the association between walking pace and all heart rhythm abnormalities was influenced by metabolic and inflammatory factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Demographic and lifestyle factors accounted for by the study included that participants reporting a faster walking pace were more likely to be men and tended to live in less deprived areas and have healthier lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Atrial fibrillation is a condition where the heart’s upper chambers beat irregularly and too fast, while ventricular arrhythmias occur when an abnormal heart rhythm starts in the lower chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Heart rhythm problems can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and cardiac arrest if left untreated. They can occur when there is a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers noted that the study was observational, meaning that no firm conclusions could be drawn on whether walking at a brisk pace was a direct cause of a lower risk of heart rhythm abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study was also limited by the fact the participants were self reported and did not reflect a broad spectrum of ages and ethnic backgrounds. The average age was 55, 55% were women and 97% were white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers, led by Prof Jill Pell of the University of Glasgow, said: “This study is the first to explore the pathways underpinning the association between walking pace and arrhythmias, and to provide evidence that metabolic and inflammatory factors may have a role: walking faster decreased the risk of obesity and inflammation, which, in turn, reduced the risk of arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This finding is biologically plausible because cumulative epidemiological studies have shown that walking pace is inversely associated with metabolic factors, such as obesity, HbA1c [fasting glucose], diabetes, and [high blood pressure] which, in turn, are associated with the risk of arrhythmias.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPdlBLQ3VFN0s5b2xCUFVHbGJsMzlINGRsa0g4X1RNMWJmaUJTOGhaa3RxY25fNVFySmRaX3A5cTlLMVlOSmY0TTcxN1FKYzJfQXdPMC1FaE1OTEF5VGpkRV84NWJpSFJQQTNqRDFmVHhMX0hmTEtIejZ6eHlxS3NDbjhjc1pTZGlrQlhjUEF2YXRzemh3Yy1POWNOZmpDX0t3RmZZX1RCZUpsSi1YeWpqMTBVeUx5YmFtX053</guid></item><item><title>“我们只是不确切知道它是什么” |乔治亚州中部兽医看到狗神秘疾病的增加- 13WMAZ | 'We just don't know exactly what it is' | Central Georgia vets seeing rise of mystery illness in dogs - 13WMAZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxPWFJIZlZpRUFObi1jZzBKdHZ0RURIaVdjZGU0NXdjUjFWWVBzOGhLTkFHVzlXSnFhTHh3WmdjcDRrSUF5LVlFRmlZNjR3WmZHVEg2X1F2Sm5EV0psOHdZOEdrWjhWYk16R1d4ZVNIdXBxU0hxS1JvaG9NLVVWN2g5MG9iT0xXN0NZQWlocW9Bb2UtQ1QyVDRGbGl4dEQ2SkluMTYyRWNGZFlENS1BUU1xcll5dlpNSXRiemRpQWx3VmwzdmxDNFd1ZWg4Zi1Jdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Veterinarians are alarmed by a rising unknown respiratory illness in dogs across Central Georgia. Here's what we found.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MACON, Ga. — A mysterious respiratory illness affecting dogs in &lt;a href="/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Central Georgia&lt;/a&gt; has veterinarians concerned as cases continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Veterinary Medical Association has identified an unknown respiratory disease that has been circulating among dogs in the region, with a notable spike in cases over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think because we just don't know exactly what it is and because if we cultured and took a swab of one dog that's not necessarily what it's gonna be for every dog," said Mary Frances Wylie, a veterinarian at Northside Wesleyan Animal Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wylie says that her clinic has treated approximately 15 dogs with the mysterious illness in the past two months alone.  She says the most common symptoms include a whooping cough-like condition and unusually low energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says it is difficult to track exact numbers because the disease remains unidentified. What makes this illness particularly concerning is its resistance to standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This illness doesn't respond as well to antibiotic treatments and sometimes requires several rounds of medication," according to the Georgia Veterinary Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of the outbreak she says appears to correlate with increased dog interactions at boarding facilities and daycare centers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"More dogs go to boarding, grooming, day cares. We just had Spring Break, President's Day, so a lot of families go out of town," she said. "That's really when it becomes more prevalent is when dogs become in close proximity to each other."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness is airborne, making it difficult to avoid completely. However, she recommends preventative measures for concerned pet owners.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Really staying on top of your vaccines with your vet, talking to them about what vaccines that your dog needs and what they're at risk for, avoiding high traffic dog areas if you can help it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most healthy dogs can safely continue normal activities, certain pets face higher risks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have an older dog with heart issues or breathing issues, those are the dogs that I would probably [be concerned about]," Dr. Wiley said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that for these vulnerable animals, "maybe just with time and avoiding dog parks, daycares if you're worried" would be the safest approach.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says that vaccination remains an important protective measure and hopes more pet owners will keep their animals' vaccines current as experts work to identify and combat this mysterious respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to monitor the situation and urge dog owners to contact their veterinarians if their pets show symptoms of respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

UTA launches an interactive exhibit to raise awareness, showing how the virus spreads through one household.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARLINGTON, Texas — The number of measles cases in Texas continues to rise, with state health officials reporting 20 new infections in the past five days. That brings the total number of cases to 561 since late January, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;with nearly all involving unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As concern grows, the University of Texas at Arlington is using education as a tool to fight misinformation and promote awareness. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The College of Nursing and Health Innovation unveiled a new, interactive “Measles Outbreak Education Experience” inside its home health suite — a space surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows that invite passersby to engage with the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted it to be very visible,” said Jennifer Roye, Assistant Dean for Simulation Technology. "It all stems from one of our employees who was taking a trip to the beach and wondered about measles transmission for her nine-month-old."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is designed to resemble a museum display, immersing visitors in a real-world outbreak scenario. Seven patient profiles within a single household are used to illustrate how quickly measles can spread.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One scenario includes patients like “Grandpa Miller,” a fictional cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s a little immunocompromised,” Roye explained, emphasizing how vulnerable populations face heightened risks during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QR codes deliver short, digital pamphlets covering prevention methods, symptoms, complications, and frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students, staff, and members of the public are encouraged to explore the display and test their knowledge. Visitors are prompted to answer questions about risk factors and transmission. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really fun way to have people interact and learn at the same time,” one student noted. “I think the displays are really nice.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As measles cases continue to rise, UTA’s exhibit offers both a timely reminder and a hands-on approach to public health education. It runs until May 9.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

Hanks had a case reported on Monday and Bel Air also had a case reported a few days ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials have initiated contact tracing to identify potential exposures and are coordinating with state partners to prevent further spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although approximately 98 percent of El Paso County residents are vaccinated against measles. Unvaccinated individuals remain at the highest risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECOMMENDED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/measles-case-reported-in-dona-ana-county-1st-in-southeast-new-mexico?SRC=LINK" target="_blank" title="https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/measles-case-reported-in-dona-ana-county-1st-in-southeast-new-mexico?SRC=LINK" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles case reported in Doña Ana County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine (MMR) is highly effective but not 100% foolproof, health officials said. Two doses provide approximately 97% protection, meaning a small number of vaccinated individuals may still contract the virus—particularly during outbreaks or in cases of weakened immune response. However, vaccinated individuals who become infected are far less likely to experience serious complications or transmit the virus to others, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;POTENTIAL EXPOSURE LOCATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited the following locations on the dates and times noted should verify their immunization status and monitor for symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DateLocationTime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/04/2025Walmart; 1850 Zaragoza4:45 p.m. – 7:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/05/2025El Paso International Airport 6701 Convair8 a.m. – 11:20 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/07/2025 El Paso International Airport 6701 Convair1:30 p.m. – 3:50 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4/04/2025Los Toreado 5331 Marcillus6:30 p.m. – 9:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who: (1) visited any of the locations above on the specified dates and times, and (2) develops a fever and rash, should contact their healthcare provider immediately for evaluation and testing.

When citizens identify ideologically with such leaders, they become more hostile toward political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This polarization is driven not by opposing politicians but by the actions and rhetoric of the leaders they support. The findings suggest that emotionally manipulative leadership poses a threat to democratic norms and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Triad Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Politicians high in narcissism, psychopathy, or Machiavellianism intensify hostility among their supporters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporter Identification:&lt;/strong&gt; The more voters identify with these leaders, the more polarized and hostile their views become.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy at Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; These traits can erode trust, reduce cooperation, and weaken democratic institutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Amsterdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politicians who exhibit ‘dark’ personality traits such as narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism contribute to increasing affective polarisation among citizens. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a new study conducted by the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the University of Lausanne and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Political Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108788"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a shadowy politician on a stage." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/politics-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Remarkably, the personality traits of political opponents have little to no effect on the degree of polarisation. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers linked the personality profiles of over 90 prominent politicians worldwide with voter attitudes in 40 national elections. The results reveal striking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians who score high on the so-called Dark Triad – narcissism (excessive self-focus), psychopathy (emotional coldness and lack of empathy), and Machiavellianism (a tendency toward manipulation and deception) – are associated with greater hostility toward political opponents among their followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polarisation from within&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers show that dark traits have an effect when voters feel ideologically close to the politician in question. The stronger the identification, the more likely supporters are to adopt hostile stances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Machiavellian politicians in particular – strategic, manipulative, goal-driven – appear to be catalysts for affective polarisation: they deepen emotional divides between their supporters and others,’ explains Alessandro Nai, researcher at the UvA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remarkably, the personality traits of political opponents have little to no effect on the degree of polarisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nai: ‘We know today that voters tend to take cues from politicians they feel close to, and are more likely to ignore messages from politicians they disagree with. It is thus our own politicians who make us angrier, fuel hostile thinking towards others, and contribute to affective polarisation. And this can have dramatic consequences.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominant leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Viktor Orbán, Narendra Modi, Silvio Berlusconi, Shinzo Abe, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and many others. Dutch politicians such as Mark Rutte and Geert Wilders were also part of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no individual scores are disclosed, the researchers emphasise a broader trend: during times of political tension, voters tend to prefer dominant, hardline leaders, even when they exhibit norm-breaking or confrontational behaviour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings cast a critical light on the global rise of ‘dark’ leaders. According to the researchers, the confrontational and uncompromising personality traits of such leaders pose clear risks to democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘When the personal traits of leaders poison public discourse, the public’s willingness to cooperate weakens, social cohesion suffers, and ultimately democratic norms erode,’ says co-author Katjana Gattermann of the UvA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers call for greater awareness of the role (dark) personality plays in political leadership, in particular when these traits appear in strongmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nai concludes: ‘We have shown in previous research that dark personality traits are particularly frequent in authoritarian leaders and populists; the evidence seems thus to be piling up that narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism are important phenomena if we want to understand why politics, today, seems so confrontational.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and politics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d6d786f6e6b72726f71747e756974737a5d686b7c337371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Laura Erdtsieck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uva.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Laura Erdtsieck – University of Amsterdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.70002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ripping the public apart?

Politicians’ dark personality and affective polarization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence exists about the importance of dark personality traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in political leaders, broadly leading to heightened political aggressiveness and partisan conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this expanding research agenda, we study the possible association between dark personality in politicians and deepened affective polarization – that is, increased affective distance between partisan groups coupled with stronger dislike for out-parties – in the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do so by linking a large-scale expert survey (NEGex) and a collection of post-election surveys (CSES), including information for more than 90 leading candidates having competed in 40 elections worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the dark personality of top politicians can be associated with upticks in affective polarization in the public – but only when it comes to the personality of in-party candidates (that is, a candidate from voters’ preferred party), and only for high levels of ideological proximity between the candidate and the voter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:32:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5IekhISGtsSFRYYkRfcjQ1RTlWOURQSlRpMjY1UkstY0xXbFJkamdYc2taTUV6OFg5ZDBsWTV4bV92R1dRbjFfVDV1TUVlRWJvdTlsWUlONE04bTVSTUpuSDhtR21EWXdsN0tKaWtUeE84OXgzMXdv</guid></item><item><title>科学所说的4种食物可以帮助你活到100岁-财富 | The 4 foods that science says can help you live to 100 - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5BTFNIMFZITGlkLVBIVXZVdHEzaHJ3ZXlsMUEzd19qTkxEaHhYZGRFZFVuWGMzYWdmSmdXNFdRcURlRmZLeWVDR3lyMnRram1yd3ptQWlmSEg3MGRWSUhvTXpiY21DeXRudGZWN253?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5BTFNIMFZITGlkLVBIVXZVdHEzaHJ3ZXlsMUEzd19qTkxEaHhYZGRFZFVuWGMzYWdmSmdXNFdRcURlRmZLeWVDR3lyMnRram1yd3ptQWlmSEg3MGRWSUhvTXpiY21DeXRudGZWN253</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，您可能需要更多这种维生素来防止记忆力减退-雅虎 | You May Need More of This Vitamin to Prevent Memory Loss, According to Experts - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNcjJYdXdleUNTOWxBaHcyWDI2cGczcjNNam02OTdnX0JxVlNldHhsdDZub3lodU53SHk3SnBIQ2JxSElnSkJBc2dlNUp1eFhsZy1zTldnRUI3TTVRU29HTktXQnc0ZzZISktQRE8tUFJBRFFBSUhLQkFuLVFubDE1T04xbFQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By now, you've likely been told to "&lt;a href="https://parade.com/849286/brendabennett/23-healthy-salads-that-will-make-you-want-to-eat-your-greens/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eat your greens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eat your greens&lt;/a&gt;" for as long as you can remember&lt;br&gt;—and therefore assume you understand why you should: Because &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heres-happens-body-eat-salad-114000919.html" data-ylk="slk:they're good for you.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;they're good for you.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yes, but that’s only a small part of the big picture.

They recommend that anyone who visited the restaurant at that time and is not immune to measles should contact to their health-care provider or call DC Health at 844-493-2652. Those who were already vaccinated for the virus do not need to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DWUAALZ7BNFN3PBPSK6MOZMFZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two doses of measles vaccine provide lifetime protection, D.C. health officials said.

And last month, a person with measles &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/25/dc-measles-case/"&gt;traveled&lt;/a&gt; from Minnesota to visit D.C. while contagious. That person had ridden an Amtrak train, walked through the concourse at Union Station and went to an urgent care center in Adams Morgan a few days later, according to the city health department. This year, there have been more than 700 confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/measles-is-spreading-heres-how-to-stay-safe/" target="_blank"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two people died of measles-related illness. Another death is currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K2AHDLBW7RBGVJ2UK4ZUQX3VLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://dchealth.dc.gov/page/measles-information-healthcare-providers"&gt;Measles &lt;/a&gt;is a highly contagious disease and spreads easily through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs or breathes. Symptoms can show up from seven to 14 days after exposure and may include a fever of over 101 degrees, along with a cough, red and watery eyes and a runny nose. After the initial symptoms begin, there is another stage three to five days later. It includes a distinctive rash on the face that spreads to the rest of the body. Health officials said someone with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPAMNZIFEJASJGHLGQ7IATEAUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Officials said in a statement that if a person has received “two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.” For someone who has received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, health officials said, “you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures if very low.” But they advise contacting a health-care provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RJKLWZW2YVFSHAUZ7JNTMWD6VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those who are exposed and at risk of developing measles should look for symptoms until 21 days after the date of their last exposure. If a person notices symptoms of measles, officials said, they should isolate themselves by staying home and away from others and get in touch with a health-care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-correction" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div data-qa="correction-disclaimer" class="wpds-c-fZDGxM wpds-c-fZDGxM-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="disclaimer-headline" class="wpds-c-kAVFVG"&gt;correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="YZE5I2QQNFCLFOVTAQP6JZYKTI" data-apitype="correction" data-testid="disclaimer-description" class="wpds-c-joLgjs"&gt;A previous version of this article incorrectly said there have been nearly 490 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The foods we eat can influence our cholesterol levels and overall heart health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While foods like oats, vegetable oils and beans get a bad reputation, they are great fits for a heart-healthy diet to lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting saturated fat and prioritizing fiber can help support healthy cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cholesterol can be a tricky topic for some. It is a type of waxy, fat-like substance that our bodies need in order to build cells and make vitamins and other hormones. That said, too much of it can lead to complications in the body, such as heart disease. There are also two different types of cholesterol in our body: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;LDL and HDL&lt;/a&gt;. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), often referred to as “bad” cholesterol, can build up as plaque in the arteries. On the other hand, HDL acts as a scavenger to pick up and remove excess cholesterol and plaque, which is why it’s called “good” cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Learning how to manage high cholesterol can be difficult, but there are ways to lower cholesterol through heart-healthy eating habits. However, there is so much conflicting information regarding nutrition that it can feel hard to decide what foods to eat. But here are some “bad” foods that actually help lower cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats are a type of whole grain that many might deem too high in carbohydrates, but oats are also high in fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly important for our bodies, as it’s crucial for heart healthy, healthy digestion, gut health and more. Oats are a type of soluble fiber that becomes a thick gel in our intestines, which slows digestion and keeps blood sugar levels from spiking. Soluble fiber can also help trap excess fat and cholesterol particles so they can't all be absorbed, which can lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One half cup of dry cereal has 4 grams of fiber as well as 5 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having one bowl in the morning along with some berries or yogurt can not only increase the fiber intake, but also increase the heart-healthy vitamins and minerals in your morning meal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vegetable oils have been circulating on social media for their adverse health effects; however, these negative claims have not been backed by science. In fact, research has linked vegetable oils like canola with improved heart health and lower LDL levels. Using canola oil in place of butter or other high-saturated fat cooking products can be beneficial for health. This is because it has a lower saturated fat content and is higher in polyunsaturated fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which can be beneficial for managing cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canola is a neutral-tasting oil and is great for dressings, grilling, baking and stir frying.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Mercury content might be associated with large fish, which can sound scary, but there are many varieties that are not only low in mercury, but also great for our health. Fish is not only a great source of protein, but it's also packed with heart-healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. Fatty fish include varieties like salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel and trout. Regularly eating fish and seafood is consistently associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; can lower triglyceride levels, may slow down the growth of plaques in the arteries and help reduce inflammation throughout the body.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some folks are hesitant about fruit because of its sugar content, but it’s important to note that all sugar found in fruit is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;naturally-occurring&lt;/a&gt; and not added sugar. Fruit is also rich in fiber, and some fruit, such as apples with the peel, strawberries and citrus, contain pectin which is a type of soluble fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Adding more soluble fiber to your day is a great way to support healthy cholesterol levels. Fruit can be added to cereal, smoothies, yogurt, salads or eaten on its own as a simple snack or side. Eating a variety of fruit not only contributes to your daily fiber intake, but it also adds to your vitamins and minerals intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans might be considered “bad” to some because they are high in carbohydrates. However, they are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complex carbs&lt;/a&gt; and are rich in fiber. Beans are especially high in soluble fiber which means that they will take more time for the body to digest, so you feel full for longer after a meal. There are so many varieties of beans available which all offer health benefits including black beans, navy beans, kidney beans, lentils, garbanzos, black-eyed peas and more. They are very accessible as many are sold ready-to-eat in cans which makes them easier to store and quicker to cook. If you are worried about the sodium content of canned beans, make sure to rinse off the liquid found in the cans before consuming and try to choose “no-salt-added” varieties when you can.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocados do have high fat content, which might be a concern for some people, but it’s a healthy kind of fat known as monounsaturated fat. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avocados&lt;/a&gt; are also high in fiber—one whole avocado contains about 10 grams—which can improve HDL and decrease LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some research has even found that swapping avocados for other high-saturated fat foods like butter, cheese or processed meats can significantly lower heart disease risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avocados are a great addition to salads, sandwiches, spread on toast, on top of eggs or as a dip for vegetables or chips.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing high cholesterol might feel overwhelming, but there are foods that can help keep your levels within a healthy range. Overall, try to limit foods high in saturated fats and opt for foods that are higher in fiber. Soluble fiber absorbs water as it moves through your digestive system and forms a gel. As it passes through your intestines, soluble fiber prevents your body from absorbing some fat and cholesterol, helping to manage cholesterol levels. Including a variety of foods, like oats, vegetable oils, beans, fruits and avocados, can help support a healthier heart.

Sometimes it’s years after welcoming your little one, other times it’s within before you’ve even pushed out your placenta. The question “Are you &lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/only-child-moms-reveal-moment-done-having-kids"&gt;going to have another&lt;/a&gt;?” or worse, “&lt;em&gt;When&lt;/em&gt; are you going to have another?” or &lt;em&gt;even worse &lt;/em&gt;“When are you going to give [child] a sibling?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At best it’s mildly annoying. At worst it’s &lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/getting-pregnant/support-secondary-infertility"&gt;profoundly hurtful&lt;/a&gt;. And yet no matter how many times we say that, the question remains, as does the belief that only children are somehow doomed to a &lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/how-break-lonely-only-child-stereotype"&gt;life of loneliness&lt;/a&gt; without a sibling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new research shows that the brains of adult only children say otherwise...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02142-4#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior &lt;/em&gt;looked at 2,397 pairs of individuals, well matched in covariates, to see how siblings or a lack of siblings affects the adult brain. Images were drawn from the CHIMGEN (Chinese Imaging Genetics) cohort, a large neuroimaging study that identifies genetic and environmental factors on the brain. Researchers looked at brain structure, function, connectivity, cognition, personality and mental health among other factors in people with siblings and growing up without siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists in China used methods including brain imaging, behavioral assessments and socioeconomic and childhood trauma questionnaires to evaluate a group of 7,186 people ages 18 to 30, including only children and those with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to brain imaging, researchers conducted behavioral assessments and questionnaires about socioeconomic and childhood trauma. Their results might be surprising, at least to every busybody auntie who insists your very happy only child &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a sibling if they ever want a fulfilled life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Contrary to the stereotypical impression of associations between [only children] and problem behaviors, we found positive correlations of GWS with neurocognition and mental health,” the abstract reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the study not only found better mental health outcomes for only children, but better memory and language ability, and life satisfaction. Only children were also found to be more creative, less reward dependent, and impulsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before the parents of only children let it go to their heads, there are some factors to consider. For one thing, “despite direct effects,” the study reads “[growing up without siblings] affects most brain and behavioural outcomes through modifiable environments, such as socioeconomic status, maternal care and family support, suggesting targets for interventions to enhance children’s healthy growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, there was a higher correlation between a family’s material resources and support systems and children’s long-term mental health than whether they had siblings. It’s &lt;em&gt;almost like &lt;/em&gt;there’s no one right way to have a family. Can you even imagine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Scary Mommy</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:58:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBzb01OLTFUaTJXME1yMEpLQURjMEFTMVdSbVFrUm1PemJzVHJPOGg4c2ZWM2hubkczUDhBMFVZWElQeE9MN0J0aV9sNjlKM1ZUcTF2NWFSSC1HM2Ezc1lRZ044RUZsZXAwVUlHZVItOE9nN0hPeG9ySDktWQ</guid></item><item><title>关于CT扫描的真相：研究警告说，普通健康检查可能导致103,000例癌症病例-财富 | The truth about CT scans: The common health check could drive 103,000 cancer cases, research warns - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE95NUs3dkhKRFRxdnBkZkFPX1MwQzdOTF92QjFuYUlhaWZKcXJQaEZHZ0tHcEdMQUEyNXZmWlNuNmlFcVpsQVlkN1JiTXptdWZnYWdDQUdHbXFuM19iWUZManNoMTEzaEVRQW13ZXBRdzBOVkg5WGhacGJDS0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE95NUs3dkhKRFRxdnBkZkFPX1MwQzdOTF92QjFuYUlhaWZKcXJQaEZHZ0tHcEdMQUEyNXZmWlNuNmlFcVpsQVlkN1JiTXptdWZnYWdDQUdHbXFuM19iWUZManNoMTEzaEVRQW13ZXBRdzBOVkg5WGhacGJDS0M</guid></item><item><title>令人胃痛的“臭脚”是减肥药物的最新奇怪副作用...哪颗星星显示出迹象？ -《每日邮报》 | Stomach-churning 'Ozempic feet' is latest bizarre side effect of weight-loss drug... which stars show signs? - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQczFtMHZTZEtkV2hmT05XaDZzbGx0V2ZQaXdxTjhNQ285Wm4tWjhDUWFCWkI4MU5GR0RLcjVTNW1KZ1hsOVlxeDFrdm13WHJ4V2VHQmJkMUZpSTNTZi1sNVZTS0hyT3h4di1kdkNQelFQQXdzNHltdGxkMHVBVEcxLTc4V1dBNVFfeEdRZDRxZXc0ME9YWnh30gGcAUFVX3lxTFAzTU1GakF0VktQNEFSVGJQTFZia0ZpVENmZjJRRFpvMm9SQms3VVRwX0JiYzc2NmFzazFxQnptMlFFQ2Q3TWhQbzg5QmJqdUhIeEM1YXpwMWxyRTNzUHdtVWVXWDdNQmhUZ1ZZWFlHaGJiZWZvcmtDR3p4cjdHaFhyc19wMEtZUk8xTERjcHNVcVhIYzQ2bHpENm11dQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blockbuster &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-d5b0c370-1a07-11f0-a079-31f60ae9f494" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; drug Ozempic can cause a surprising side effect in your feet, doctors say - and some celebrities are already showing signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term refers to sagging or aging skin on the feet due to rapid fat loss — and it's the latest addition to a growing list of concerns that includes 'Ozempic face' and 'Ozempic butt', both caused by dramatic changes in body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the drug has taken Hollywood by storm, experts warn the cosmetic downsides are catching up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon told DailyMail.com that a loss of fat in the body can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic, along with sister drug Mounjaro, is approved to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-c4e3e370-1a15-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sharon Osbourne took to Instagram to share a cozy picture of herself with her two-year-old grandson and pet dog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skin on the top of the foot is delicate, thin and has lower fat reserves than the bottom or sole of the foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As you age, the fat pads in the foot can become even more scarce and lead to loose skin and wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking weight loss drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro can significantly reduce the fat reserves in the whole body, including the feet - leading to excessive sagging and wrinkles due to muscle loss, Dr Weintraub said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eagle eyed fans were quick to notice the strange wrinkling on Osbourne's feet in her Instagram post from April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The star's perfectly smooth facial complexion, which some users claimed was achieved with a filter, contrasted her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Instagrammer commented: 'Beautiful airbrushed photo but feet tell your age'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While another quipped: 'How strange when the skin on your hands and feet don't match the skin on your face'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, while many thought that she was simply showing signs of aging, Dr Weintraub believes otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained to this website: 'Seeing veiny and sagging skin on the top and sides of the foot is most likely a result of the new lack of water retention due to a decreased BMI caused by Ozempic and other such weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the heart becomes less taxed with extra weight, the water retention decreases, and the substructures of the foot (veins, tendons, bones) often become more visible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, Winfrey said taking weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14315339/oprah-winfrey-ozempic-realize-truth-people.html"&gt;helped her realize the truth about 'thin people.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the media mogul finally admitted to using an undisclosed GLP-1 - a type 2 diabetes medication that can also aid in weight loss - to shed nearly 50 pounds after decades of yo-yo dieting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having nearly reached her goal weight of 160 pounds (72kg), Winfrey revealed her experience taking a GLP-1 and what it has taught her about 'thin people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the things that I realized the very first time I took a GLP-1 was that all these years I thought that thin people had more willpower,' Winfrey confessed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon exclusively told DailyMail.com that a loss of fat in the body can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

UCSF estimates that 93 million CT scans were performed in the U.S. in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the number of CT scans performed in the U.S. has increased by 30% since 2007. UCSF scientists say that this should give pause to medical professionals about whether the benefits of CT scans outweigh the risks. UCSF noted in a press release that its research might indicate that CT scans are being overused for instances of upper respiratory infections and common headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Few patients and their families are counseled about the risks associated with CT examinations,” study co-author Malini Mahendra, UCSF assistant professor of Pediatric Critical Care, said in a press release. “We hope our study’s findings will help clinicians better quantify and communicate these cancer risks, allowing for more informed conversations when weighing the benefits and risks of CT exams.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/medicine/rfk-jr-weighs-options-for-medicare-medicaid-coverage-of-glp-1-medications" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;RFK Jr. weighs options for Medicare, Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stated in a press release that the largest number of cancers in adults was due to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, while children faced a higher risk of cancer following CT scans of the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic states that CT scans use ionizing radiation to help capture images but generally carry little risk. CT scans can help show heart disease, blood clots, bone fractures, certain types of cancer, among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A CT scan is an imaging test that helps healthcare providers detect diseases and injuries," the Cleveland Clinic says. "It uses a series of X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of your bones and soft tissues. A CT scan is painless and noninvasive. You might go to a hospital or imaging center for your CT scan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCSF researchers believe that there are some instances where CT scans should either be performed at a lower intensity or avoided altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the large volume of CT use in the United States, many cancers could occur in the future if current practices don’t change,” said the study's first author, Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a UCSF radiologist. “Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight. Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/ozempic-wegovy-may-be-linked-to-increased-risk-of-condition-that-causes-blindness-new-study-shows" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Ozempic, Wegovy may be linked to increased risk of condition that causes blindness, new study shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Americans are in the middle of a love-affair with protein.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000g3b6mh8ozsgna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A stroll through almost any major supermarket — where food labels tout grams of protein — bears witness to the trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000h3b6my9qedpi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And why shouldn’t we be? Along with carbohydrates and fat, protein is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594226/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the three main macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; that make up our diet. Furthermore, it is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, making it essential for survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000i3b6mysdz95lv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557845/" target="_blank"&gt;Amino acids&lt;/a&gt; have a hand in &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002222.htm" target="_blank"&gt;many bodily processes&lt;/a&gt;, such as building and preserving muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting the immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. And while our bodies can make some of the needed amino acids, it can’t make them all. Enter dietary protein.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000j3b6mjkoixlbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is the optimal amount you should be getting? The answer is that it’s complicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000k3b6mtf4ryifw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;recommended dietary allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) of protein for adults 18 and older is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound) per day, which translates to about 54 grams of protein for a 150-pound person, or 72 grams for someone weighing 200 pounds. &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp/dietary-guidelines-americans" target="_blank"&gt;Established jointly&lt;/a&gt; by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Health and Human Services, the RDA represents the minimum amount of protein that must be eaten by a relatively sedentary person to meet the basic needs of their body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There’s also something called the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR), which was developed by the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/dietary-reference-intakes-for-macronutrients" target="_blank"&gt;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; to establish ranges for carbohydrates, fat and protein that are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Those guidelines, which put intake within the context of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm" target="_blank"&gt;an entire diet&lt;/a&gt;, recommend protein make up between &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/7" target="_blank"&gt;10% and 35%&lt;/a&gt; of the calories in an adult’s diet. (The &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan" target="_blank"&gt;number of calories per day&lt;/a&gt; an adult should be getting depends on characteristics such as age, sex, weight and activity level.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            All that is to say, there is no exact number for the amount of protein that you should be getting. If you look at &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2017_March%202020.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the statistics&lt;/a&gt;, most people in the United States are getting more than enough; if you listen to some influencers, you are not getting enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I was in L.A., and I did some interviews there, and nine out of 10 people I asked, ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ — it was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing,” Dr. Tim Spector told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. Spector is a genetic epidemiologist and researcher at King’s College London and founder of one of the world’s largest twins registries, TWINS UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “They’ve been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they’re somehow deficient and they’re not going to be lean and have a six-pack and be running marathons (if they don’t),” he said. Spector is also author of several best-selling books including “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Life-Science-bestselling-SPOON-FED/dp/1787330494" target="_blank"&gt;Food for Life: The New Science of Eating Well&lt;/a&gt;.” (He’s also a co-founder of ZOE, a personalized nutrition app).

            Spector has nothing at all against protein per se. “In general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it’s plant protein — but, nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation. But it’s what it replaces,” he said. “We need to start thinking much more holistically.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000s3b6m4x0zk6a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein,” he added. “There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount, and &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt; 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber.&lt;/a&gt;”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000t3b6mxm8gxn9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spector said certain groups may require a bit more protein: older adults, people going through &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/menopause-fatigue-heavy-bleeding-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;   or recovering from serious illness, those with restrictive diets and people who are “training incredibly hard.” But the rest of us — in the United States, at least — do just fine. (Many people &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-per-capita-protein-supply" target="_blank"&gt;in developing countries&lt;/a&gt; do not &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/pabra-new-beans-africa-spc/index.html"&gt;get adequate protein&lt;/a&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000u3b6m6ibwkxg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you find that you need it, how can you get some additional high-quality protein into your diet — while benefiting from other important nutrients and without relying on highly processed sweetened powders and snack bars? Here are Spector’s top five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000x3b6mmbnqg4yn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They come in many forms — black, pinto, broad, kidney, and more — but they never get the attention they deserve,”  said Spector via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000y3b6mdyq1xuxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re all good sources of healthy plant protein,” he noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000z3b6mxv3rdano@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beans are also loaded with other good-for-you nutrients. “Importantly, they also contain fiber (a nutrient that most people really are deficient in), and other healthy plant compounds, like polyphenols,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00103b6mr1x27xvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Load up on the three-bean salad or bean burrito. Those &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/15/health/canned-dried-beans-recipes-wellness/index.html"&gt;bean are inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;, come in a wide variety and, if you buy them dried, are extremely shelf-stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00123b6m3aqrgsy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearty and versatile, whole grains — such as barley, brown rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn, millet, oats, quinoa, rye and whole wheat — contain the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ and endosperm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00133b6mryo47on4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whole grains are good for a wide range of reasons,” said Spector via email. “They are a great source of fiber and include a wide range of micronutrients. They’re also much higher in protein than people expect. For instance, oats have 11g of protein per 100g compared with 13g per 100g for eggs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00143b6mxythvizf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Regularly consuming whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of many health conditions, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes,” he noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00153b6m92ukwn8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An easy way to get more in your diet? “Swap products that contain highly refined grains — like white rice, pasta, and bread — for whole grain versions, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and wholewheat bread,” he said.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00183b6m50imfjnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of us love a good burger or steak, but eating too much of a good thing is not so good for you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00193b6m8itw2uin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s true that meat is a great source of protein,” Spector said. “However, for your health and the health of the planet, it’s best to reduce your meat intake, particularly red and processed meat.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001a3b6mmf3swdc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some people worry that most plants are not complete proteins, so they might be missing out on specific amino acids,” he noted. “But each plant source of protein has a unique amino acid profile. By consuming a wide variety of plants, you will naturally take in all the amino acids you need.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001b3b6mctxn0qo0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And  don’t panic. Nobody is saying you have to cut out meat entirely. “Consider replacing half of the meat in your stews, chilis, or soups with mixed lentils and beans, tofu, or tempeh, or have one or two vegetarian or pescetarian days each week,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001c3b6m4zxgu775@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you do eat meat, Spector added, “try to choose good quality products and opt for leaner cuts.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9hlioi7001r3b6muj52kxhg@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="go-nuts-over-nuts-and-seeds" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Go nuts over nuts and seeds
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001e3b6mtm283mae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people avoid nuts and seeds because they’re relatively high in fat,” Spector said. “Although this is true, they contain healthy unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which support good health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001f3b6mqqlnkohu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may come as no surprise to find “they’re also a good source of healthy plant protein and a wide range of vitamins and minerals,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001g3b6mrrgndqmt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not a fan of munching on straight-up nuts or seeds, Spector said you can sprinkle them on most dishes “savory or sweet — to provide extra texture and flavor.” Consider adding them to your yogurt parfait, salad or stew.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001h3b6meegofhe2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Peanut butter is also a good choice, he said, “but find a product with as few ingredients as possible, and no added sugar or salt.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001k3b6mfx3c1ppl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Soy is one of the few complete proteins in the plant world,” Spector said. “It’s also incredibly versatile and can easily be incorporated into meals. Consider adding tofu, tempeh or edamame to the dishes you already love.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001l3b6mrphcx2g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As an added bonus, he said, “soy products contain fiber and are rich in vitamins and minerals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001m3b6m5tkcla2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to protein, Spector said most people should seek out quality over quantity. “Focus on plants, and ignore products that claim to be high in protein, because they’re probably also high in salt, sugar, and other additives your body doesn’t need,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001n3b6mnqqxaw3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For over fifty years&lt;/strong&gt;, the scientific community has grappled with an unsolved puzzle in the realm of human blood types. It all began in 1972 when doctors discovered something extraordinary during the blood analysis of a pregnant woman. Her blood sample lacked a surface molecule that was otherwise present on every other known red blood cell. After decades of research, scientists have finally cracked the case, unveiling a &lt;strong&gt;new blood group system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Blood Group Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough, &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/144/26/2735/517404/Deletions-in-the-MAL-gene-result-in-loss-of-Mal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, marks a major milestone in the field of hematology. The discovery not only answers an age-old question but also opens the door to improving medical care for individuals with rare blood types. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Louise Tilley, a UK National Health Service hematologist, was instrumental in this accomplishment, having &lt;strong&gt;spent nearly 20 years investigating &lt;/strong&gt;the genetic anomaly. The new &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group adds to the already extensive list of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/scientists-discover-a-second-heart-that-powers-our-blood-circulation/"&gt;blood systems&lt;/a&gt;, such as the well-known &lt;strong&gt;ABO&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rh&lt;/strong&gt; groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; is different from these major systems, being based on the absence of an antigen called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AnWj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;more than 99.9% &lt;/strong&gt;of people have this antigen on their red blood cells. The patient in 1972, however, lacked it entirely, leading to an extensive investigation by a team led by Tilley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the MAL Blood Group?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group gets its name from the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; protein, which is known to play an important role in cell membrane stability and cell transport. The discovery of this new blood group comes after years of research into the genetic cause of &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood types.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers were able to confirm the connection between the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene and the absence of the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt; antigen by inserting a normal &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene into cells from patients who lacked the antigen. This insertion successfully reintroduced the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt; antigen to those cells, confirming the gene’s pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tilley explained that the work was challenging due to the rarity of the condition: “The work was difficult because the genetic cases are very rare.” This rarity made it particularly tough to identify the genetic markers responsible for the anomaly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Underpinnings of MAL&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When individuals possess a mutated version of both copies of their &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; genes, they exhibit an &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood type. This discovery was crucial because it enabled the team to identify patients who carry this rare blood type. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found that some individuals with this blood type did not have the expected genetic mutation, indicating that other medical conditions could suppress the antigen’s presence on the red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers observed that all patients with &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood shared the same mutation. However, no other abnormal cell characteristics or diseases were found to be linked with this &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/mice-with-a-human-gene-mutation-start-talking-differently-and-it-might-be-why-we-speak/"&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identification of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group has substantial medical consequences. As &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; is an extremely rare blood type, understanding its genetic origins enables healthcare professionals to provide better care to patients with this blood group. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, with the discovery of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene, doctors can now test patients to determine whether their &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative status is inherited or caused by some form of genetic suppression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Satchwell, a biologist at the University of the West of England, noted the complexity of identifying the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; protein: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAL is a &lt;strong&gt;very small protein &lt;/strong&gt;with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify and meant we needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(AP) — When the nation’s top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., endorsed the measles vaccine this month after an outbreak in Texas claimed the life of a second child, his comments made waves because he has spent &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-vaccines-trump-rfkjr-7f8dcb25de76a5a70710d22bbc63f6fa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 years making false claims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;20 years making false claims&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines are unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many of Kennedy's anti-vaccine allies stood by him anyway, trying to tamp down concerns from others who accused Kennedy of abandoning their movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That's because, according to doctors, public health experts and propaganda researchers who know Kennedy’s history well, the health and human services secretary is threading the needle between his agency's role as a neutral arbiter of science and the rhetoric of anti-vaccine activists. They say his word choices reflect that he is working from the anti-vaccine playbook he has used for much of his career in public life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Below, The Associated Press examines his comments about the measles outbreak that has infected more than 700 people nationwide and killed three, how his allies have interpreted them, and the facts according to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A Kennedy spokesperson said the health secretary is not anti-vaccine and had “responded to the measles outbreak with clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles.” He did not respond to questions about how Kennedy’s comments were being interpreted by his allies in the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Endorsing vaccines, but then sowing doubt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHAT KENNEDY SAID: “The federal government’s position, my position, is people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS this month after an unvaccinated child in Texas died of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Later, in the same interview, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/o2U0csKvqMY?t=547" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:raised safety concerns about the measles vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;raised safety concerns about the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, saying testing was inadequate. He also raised safety concerns about the vaccine for pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: Charlene Bollinger, who &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/anti-vaccine-bollinger-coronavirus-disinformation-a7b8e1f33990670563b4c469b462c9bf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:runs a business selling anti-vaccine videos;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;runs a business selling anti-vaccine videos&lt;/a&gt; and other products, highlighted in a Substack post how Kennedy had raised safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In posts on X, she urged critics of his comments to “Trust him. Trust me. He’s not walked through fire for years to abandon us now,” then added, “Read what he said carefully and with a critical spirit ... pay attention to the things he didn’t say. There are clues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The group American Values, which was set up to support Kennedy’s presidential run, posted a thread on X that amplified Kennedy’s comments questioning vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: The measles vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/?srsltid=AfmBOoq99DpPU3aZ3WC6SG8lwyL3Gp_0NPx6zYkGGNgF9yupq0lh9rJD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:safe and effective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;, and protecting people from outbreaks requires nearly everyone to be vaccinated. Public schools in the United States generally require children to be vaccinated against measles to attend, though a growing number of parents have been avoiding those mandates for their children, in some cases by getting exemptions. That has fueled low vaccination rates in communities around the U.S., which has left them vulnerable to measles and other infectious diseases. Just &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccinations-kindergarten-exemptions-cdc-1c0f9a196a70491fccf48b9125090de0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:92.7% of kindergartners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;92.7% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; got their required shots in 2023, below the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;READING BETWEEN THE LINES: If Kennedy had truly changed his mind about the benefits of vaccines, he would have explained what he got wrong in the past, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. He didn’t do that and instead immediately questioned how vaccines are safety tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If someone like RFK Jr. with his record were going to make an about-face on his position on the measles vaccine, you would expect an essay, an articulation of what he got wrong in the past. You’re not seeing that,” Adalja said. “The fact that he undercuts it almost immediately speaks to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Saying people who died of measles were ‘already sick’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHAT KENNEDY SAID: Health authorities have said the two children who died were both &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unvaccinated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, that they died as a result of measles and that &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neither had any reported underlying conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;neither had any reported underlying conditions&lt;/a&gt;. But Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=228&amp;amp;v=o2U0csKvqMY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:suggested those who died;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;suggested those who died&lt;/a&gt; during the outbreak were “people who were already sick.” He said the second child who died had various other health problems and asserted that “ &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/o2U0csKvqMY?t=282" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the thing that killed her was not the measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the thing that killed her was not the measles&lt;/a&gt;, but it was a bacteriological infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Her death was caused by pneumonia,” Kennedy told Fox News. “So, you know, her parents said that she was over measles two weeks before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s spokesperson did not respond to questions asking where he got his information about the child’s medical history and to clarify why what he said conflicted with statements from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: The anti-vaccine group Kennedy led for years, Children’s Health Defense, promoted his comments, posting a clip online and saying it shows that Kennedy “confirms the so-called ‘measles deaths’ are NOT actually measles deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;American Values wrote that his comments constituted a “bombshell” because the child “did not pass away from measles, despite what the media claimed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: Pneumonia is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complication of measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;complication of measles&lt;/a&gt;, and is the most common cause of death from measles in young children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a subsidiary of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;READING BETWEEN THE LINES: Kennedy’s comments suggesting measles didn’t kill the child reflect longstanding tactics used to create doubt about vaccines, said Renee DiResta, a professor at Georgetown University who researches propaganda and has studied the anti-vaccine movement. She said Kennedy and Children’s Health Defense have spent years telling people that measles is a routine and harmless childhood illness to justify the argument that a safe vaccine is somehow more risky than the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Reframing these deaths as something other than what they are – deaths from measles, which is not harmless at all – is necessary to prop up the dual pillars of anti-vaccine propaganda in play here,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It reflects a similar narrative that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people who wanted to minimize its seriousness suggested people were dying “with COVID” rather than from COVID, said Richard Carpiano, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Riverside, who has closely followed Kennedy’s anti-vaccine work. It’s a way of minimizing the deadly nature of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;‘Standing with the unvaccinated’ and personal choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHAT KENNEDY SAID: Kennedy attended the funeral of the 8-year-old girl who died, then posted online about meeting with her family and the family of a 6-year-old girl who died in February. In one post about the trip, he wrote that “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He also posted photos of himself with the families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHAT HIS ALLIES HEARD: Kennedy’s positive comments about the measles vaccine prompted some criticism from his old group Children’s Health Defense. CEO Mary Holland said in a video that Kennedy no longer speaks for the group, and said he had put out what she called “very partial information.” She claimed that a vaccination for measles had caused her son’s autism. But she went on to praise Kennedy’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People should not get lost in Bobby Kennedy saying that the vaccine can prevent measles,” Holland said, adding, “Bobby went to stand with the unvaccinated. And he has said it’s a personal choice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Children’s Health Defense and Bollinger have sued a number of news organizations, among them the AP, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS, ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS: Scientists have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-vaccines-trump-rfk-polio-4d1ef5bd69dc20533e95e8e34e0b1e86" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ruled out any link;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ruled out any link&lt;/a&gt; between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have saved an estimated 154 million lives in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organization, which says immunization has been the greatest contribution to ensuring babies live until their first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;READING BETWEEN THE LINES: Carpiano said Kennedy helped the anti-vaccine movement pivot to the idea that it is about personal rights, personal freedoms and medical freedom. While there is a libertarian bent to it, that framing leaves out an important piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s the freedom to do whatever you want. A libertarian would say, ‘provided it doesn’t hurt other people,’” he said. But when it comes to Kennedy and the anti-vaccine movement, the part about not hurting other people gets left out, Carpiano said. “And so basically becomes a tyranny of the minority,” Carpiano said. “It’s something that he helps to keep promoting and legitimating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:20:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPV3YzV1ZrZmd2Q3hWbUhRWE9Wc1lGT3c4SXc5aXcyR0x0UjBqNkktSEhuRUV3Y0VUNW9PaUpuQ01RbXUwUzBHQmhuQWdQOVJoN09oYUw0TmhpSnNqWWhvTjJvdEYtbTh2QXhSNlh5bGFsdXViWDBjd2hUakI3UDBMaGFfV0VPSVA0ZFE</guid></item><item><title>翻译肯尼迪的反疫苗盟友在应对麻疹爆发时听到的内容-美联社新闻 | Translating what Kennedy’s anti-vaccine allies hear in his response to the measles outbreak - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOWUxNbk1uWFRVS2Q2SnhKUTl6OXR1ZWtZU2RmWk5zZXJob0xIWHZYWmVFM2Z5UWY4QklEZERtRnNCNTFiZlJ0WUhzeGcweUsyaDFYYk1GRzZRVzdmVU9ZWThsUlRHMkxGdHBiNFVKNzZnbDBKVDRid2xrQkZpTmNTdmVrZU1vTDVlc2liWUZoWThXM3M1dmZ2cHdVY3M1c3Y1dFpr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOWUxNbk1uWFRVS2Q2SnhKUTl6OXR1ZWtZU2RmWk5zZXJob0xIWHZYWmVFM2Z5UWY4QklEZERtRnNCNTFiZlJ0WUhzeGcweUsyaDFYYk1GRzZRVzdmVU9ZWThsUlRHMkxGdHBiNFVKNzZnbDBKVDRid2xrQkZpTmNTdmVrZU1vTDVlc2liWUZoWThXM3M1dmZ2cHdVY3M1c3Y1dFpr</guid></item><item><title>我在欧洲吃了，喝了，一年没去健身房了……但还是变得更健康了。我的身体发生了什么让我震惊-每日邮报 | I ate, drank, and didn't gym for a year in Europe... and still got fitter.

He moved from the US to Europe, where he credits the shift in lifestyle and better food quality for his dramatic results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Striking before-and-after photos of the 33-year-old show a clear difference: his pot belly is gone, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14578141/how-lost-50kg-without-ozempic.html"&gt;replaced by a defined chest&lt;/a&gt;, sculpted obliques, and a healthy glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just about appearances - Dave says blood tests back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before leaving America, his cholesterol levels were flagged as 'elevated.' Eight months into his European life, new tests revealed his numbers had not only dropped, but hit 'optimal' levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dave, who previously lived in Reno, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-d0bb79d0-1a18-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, claims he made zero conscious effort to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-d0b6bee0-1a18-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; or get fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He insists he didn't overhaul his diet or start working out. In fact, he leaned in even harder to indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I arrived in Europe, I didn't follow any diet plans,' he said. 'I drank copious amounts of wine and beer and ate all the local delicacies wherever I went.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't about to pass up the pain au chocolat in Paris or the duck and dumplings in Prague.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after photos of Dave Alastair, 33, show him modeling a svelter physique after his time overseas, and he says medical tests also showed an improvement in his health. His tattoos are flipped in the 'after' photo as it is a mirrored selfie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his indulgent diet, Dave found the pounds dropped off and he puts this down to a variety of differences between Europe and the US when it comes to food and lifestyle choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, the YouTuber believes that 'food in Europe is much more high quality and doesn't have things like additives, fillers (ingredients added to food products primarily to increase volume and bulk), genetically modified organisms and chemicals' in it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingredients distributor Tilley Distribution highlights why this difference in ingredients occurs between the two regions. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It notes: 'In the US, the FDA takes a notably more hands-off approach to testing and inspections, often allowing new food ingredients unless proven harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This includes ingredients, for example, GMOs, growth hormones and chemical preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In Europe, the EFSA requires additives to be proven safe before approval and has banned the use of growth hormones and several chemical additives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe the ultra-processed nature of US food versus European products may play a role in weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, many pasta brands in the US use thickening agents, coloring agents and additives like emulsifiers which prolong their shelf life which have been linked to bloating, sluggishness and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pasta, meanwhile in Europe, is usually made with just semolina wheat flour and water, leaving out the preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And science suggests the lack of processed foods could have real benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study in The Journal of Nutrition, for example, found pasta that is less processed tends to digest slower, slowing down the rate that glucose enters the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amie Alexander, a registered dietitian at Nutri Peak in Australia, previously told DailyMail.com that portion sizes also tend to be smaller in European countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, which could help with digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Meals are also combined with other nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, which can further blunt blood sugar responses.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next up, Dave says he has observed how Europeans drink lots of coffee and smoke more than Americans, which could help in curbing hunger pangs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown that coffee may be beneficial for weight loss when consumed in moderation and without excessive added sugar or cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study followed the coffee habits of more than 150,000 participants and found that drinking unsweetened coffee was associated with a modest reduction in weight gain over four years after adjusting for other lifestyle variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite his indulgent diet, Dave found the pounds dropped off and he puts this down to a variety of differences between Europe and the US when it comes to food and lifestyle choices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A photo of Dave when he was living in America before his transformation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With each additional cup, the coffee drinkers gained about a quarter of a pound less than their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, it is well known that nicotine in cigarettes suppresses appetite and increases metabolism, and also serves as a distraction from hunger or food craving, despite the massive increased risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While he didn't change his workout regime, Dave said he started walking lots more after relocating to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The globetrotter reveals: 'There's no doubt that when I'm in Europe I walk so much more than I do in the United States and I think this is by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the automotive boom in the early 20th century many deals were done to invest heavily in highways instead of trains and that's how America became such a car-centric culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I do think this contributes to Europeans walking a lot more on average than Americans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking after a meal has consistently been shown to help food digest more quickly and gas move throughout the digestive system easier, preventing bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study even found that a two-minute walk after eating helps lower blood sugar levels because muscles will soak up extra glucose in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dave says that food in US grocery stores is generally more unhealthy than in Europe and the fast-food culture is another major culprit in the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains that in America breakfast cereals are 'just made up of corn and sugar' while organic grocery stores such as Whole Foods are only accessible to wealthy shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in Europe healthier food is more accessible, he says, with more fresh produce and farmer's markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the topic of fast food, he tells viewers in one of his YouTube videos: 'I also think it is the culture as well where people in the United States choose the easier faster option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's such a fast-paced life in the United States that sometimes it's easier just to go through a drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After posting about his weight loss experience in Europe, many viewers responded with similar tales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, there are fast food drive-thrus in Europe but most people choose different, healthier options and eat fast food in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fast food in Europe is much smaller portioned than the ones in the United States.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conclude, Dave says he doesn't claim that 'if you move to Europe you will magically lose all of this weight and be super healthy but for some strange reason this has been the case for me and I kind of don't even know how it happened'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After posting about his weight loss experience in Europe, many viewers responded with similar tales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commenter wrote: 'I lived in Barcelona for a year and the same thing happened to me. And I ate all the things; fresh bread and other baked goods, fried things and drank wine everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;' When I returned to Los Angeles I was lighter than I ever was, and had zero food allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Here in LA I find it beneficial to eat low carb, gluten free and abstain from alcohol if I want to feel good and not gain weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another viewer revealed: 'I noticed the same thing when I was over there. My first two weeks in Europe were in Portugal and that's where I noticed the biggest difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was walking/exploring more. My stress level dropped to NOTHING and my food seemed much healthier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went over with a 31' waist and came back to the US at nearly a 30' waist. My two-liter became a six pack again and I honestly felt 10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had Sangria and Gelato on a regular basis but I just have a feeling that everything was more natural and not full of preservatives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Previous &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7011a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC reports&lt;/a&gt; showed that 1 in 54 8-year-olds had been diagnosed with autism in 2016. In 2000, it was 1 in 150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The most striking piece of this is how unbelievably common  presentations of autism are,” said Zachary Warren, an author of the new report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Warren, also the executive director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD) in Nashville, Tennessee, largely attributed the increases to improvements in detecting the developmental disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors are better than ever at identifying autism, with awareness at an all-time high. “Without a doubt, we’ve become exceptionally efficient in this surveillance work,” Warren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What other factors could be causing the rise in autism? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Answers are both inconclusive and wildly complicated. Potential causes have been scrutinized for decades, and there doesn’t seem to be a single smoking gun. The leading theory lies in genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have pretty compelling data that there are causes of autism, not a single cause,” Warren said. “We may have hundreds, if not 1000s, of different neurogenetic factors that influence presentations of autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite proven research to the contrary, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-autism-summit-age-rfk-jr-rcna200240" target="_blank"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;. has repeatedly suggested that vaccines — specifically the shots that protect against measles, mumps and rubella — are linked to autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;link has been widely debunked&lt;/a&gt;, but continues to contribute to a decline in vaccine uptake across the U.S. — even amid a growing measles outbreak that’s sickened hundreds and killed two young children in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC study also looked at autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds, estimated to be 1 in 34 in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Boys were three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism. Diagnoses were also more common among Black and Hispanic children compared with white children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The disorder appears to be a focus of the Trump administration. Both the president and Kennedy have said it’s critical to find what’s causing autism in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During a meeting at the White House last week, Kennedy said his agency will move forward with a “massive testing and research effort” to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-says-hhs-will-determine-cause-autism-september-rcna200768" target="_blank"&gt;find the cause of autism by September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;It was unclear how the HHS effort would be different from previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPSlhvZlRhd2s0RllEZ3BNajVOMnlPOE9jc1pBQ0NEM2JlSm9xZno4bjB3bVRGRU5zVlRoaE5yTlFMMmV0eXhZRHRDajh5Ui1peDRjMnZ3Sl9HMXpLcWI2SHM3X0hWZXltVlp6dWtxMU9nWGJXSklWZXJ6SXhVUEo5SWZZTGVVY2FHUTUyVGhIZVRhdENKUkJF0gFWQVVfeXFMT2FJWjBfRzZkVXNlQ3NmTjFXU1JHRnZnM2dtMm9vRVJZREV1STIzRHZkWHdObkpmV1NJSnI2S29oZ3BBUnpCNFZ4UmNiT3ZqUWpmSXpyVlE</guid></item><item><title>如果您不喜欢锻炼，这里有一种科学支持的方法可以让您变得更健康-《华盛顿邮报》 | Here’s a science-backed way to get healthier if you don’t like exercise - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPelYxTVlQaHE4cUFna1ZCY3BvMmpEOGRoZlpuV2tfOXpGNC1nQVhDMFhYQWZNcHMxQ0ltdmFSR01Ic2FWb0xySG8xM2tYcDlVcWl0R2tic2l1UW11bTB2VHJpZGJPblJCanpDM2tUWUl6UEx1Q3A5ak1nZVJOeDg0S2hLa3lMLUtMT1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D3KTKIQSZFAYTCDBBKZVOEEDEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re not a fan of working out or simply don’t have time, we’ve got good news for you. Doing everyday chores and activities a bit more briskly might lead to big gains in health and longevity, a new study shows.

None formally exercised. But some moved with more zip than others as they went about their lives, taking the stairs instead of the escalator, for instance, or speed vacuuming their living rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJWXQE5S6FAVRACTR626AWTUVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amounts of these everyday exertions were small, the study found, often less than five minutes a day, but the impacts appeared outsized. Those who moved around briskly were as much as half as likely to experience or of a heart attack or stroke in the following years as people who almost always dawdled through their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24PWXMFKKZDPRI5T6AW4X22V4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests that “it’s a good idea to find ways to fit exertion into your daily life,” said Emmanuel Stamatakis, a professor at the University of Sydney, who led the study. “But that doesn’t mean you have to actually exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="IONFTEBDQNBHTNAFW4WLNHFCAI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="IONFTEBDQNBHTNAFW4WLNHFCAI"&gt;The science on movement vs. exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R3DLRVHSDBBHBITJ6ZJAB2FF6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study advances a growing area of research into whether and how we can be healthy without exercise. For the past few years, Stamatakis and his colleagues have been using data from the immense UK Biobank to explore that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2NA53PF4NJDELCOLBL6AV62RNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The biobank has enrolled tens of thousands of British adults, who provided health information and tissue samples. Many of them also wore advanced activity trackers for a week, which provided detailed readouts of how they spent almost every moment of their days at work and home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QMNZ3ADGV5EK7E47IODP2TS5QU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In past studies from his lab, Stamatakis and his co-authors analyzed those readouts and related health and death records. They discovered that people who said they never exercised but who often moved around at what scientists call a vigorous pace — meaning they got out of breath as they ran for a bus or sprinted intensely up the stairs — typically developed fewer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467622/" target="_blank"&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x" target="_blank"&gt;lived longer than people&lt;/a&gt; who rarely, if ever, moved vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYWLJIFQAZDYVALAG7SYRSVNLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Stamatakis knew, as an exercise scientist, that a lot of people are intimidated by words like vigorous and intense, in the context of exercise and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FYD4V2Z3FD3ZKONM2JGODDADU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the latest study, he and colleagues decided to see whether gentler forms of everyday activities might also be associated with better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="K364TQKVTZANVMWADBCISXC4F4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="K364TQKVTZANVMWADBCISXC4F4"&gt;Moving in short bursts has greatest benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SKHEGXVUJFEAXPRZQ4UYPAFD44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In simple terms, physical activity can be light, moderate or vigorous, depending on how hard you push yourself. Light-intensity activities feel easy enough that you can chat with someone without puffing and even sing. During moderate activity, you’re still able to talk, a little breathlessly, but not sing. When activity grows vigorous, you can barely speak without gasping, and you certainly can’t sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGVV6SDWZ5HY5N4UUQ6U3LUIBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To conduct their study,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Stamatakis and his colleagues used algorithmic machine learning to closely analyze movement patterns in 10-second increments and determine whether someone was moving lightly, moderately or vigorously. They used biobank tracker records from 24,139 adults who never formally exercised, then cross-checked against hospital and death data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OPFFFEJKAJA5TPPBE7OGUXBNAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What they found was that light everyday activities, which might include strolls to pick up lunch or visit the copier, slightly reduced risks for cardiovascular problems and deaths during the next eight years, compared to people who recorded almost zero activity (meaning they remained seated for almost the entire day). But people needed more than two hours a day of light activity to see much benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5FGGWMDMJG7LOEO4WWWDMUXYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Moderate everyday activity was far more potent. If people spent 24 minutes a day moving around at a moderate pace, their risks of developing or dying from cardiovascular problems dropped by as much as 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRPMO7L76FEBXIY5JFNKE2TLTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the most effective dose of vigorous everyday movement was even lower. Barely five minutes a day of pacing around or rushing places while huffing and puffing was associated with nearly 40 percent less likelihood of dying from heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="3UIOKAMTJ5DSJGUYCQCHV2EKRM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="3UIOKAMTJ5DSJGUYCQCHV2EKRM"&gt;Clean and garden as fast as you can&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66247GDTT5ARHC65LZWWO7THCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;From a practical standpoint, the takeaway of the new study is straightforward, Stamatakis said. “Look for opportunities” to ramp up the intensity of chores and activities, he said, especially if you don’t often exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XJILI5YPFBVRIEQ6ZFVLDKUH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Taking the stairs will be moderate activity for most people,” he said. Hurrying up them will be vigorous. Or pick up the pace while you walk, swinging your arms, “which is what we call sprint walking,” he said, “and is moderate. Or garden as fast as you can. There are plenty of opportunities to add a little more exertion” to what you’re going to be doing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z4VWMKHK25HK5PLRQGBAUYKLDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study has limitations, of course. It mostly involved White, educated Brits. It’s also possible that people who move through chores slowly have underlying health problems, predisposing them to heart risks, without any contribution from their daily movements. But the researchers excluded anyone who experienced heart problems in the first year of the study, lessening that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6IZ5KSMNGZEL5E37UOZLLM3YPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps most important, the findings aren’t meant to discourage exercise. “You can do both,” Stamatakis said, exercise and push yourself sometimes as you go about your day, assuming that your health and circumstances allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDV2ZLKCKFHEZCLZ6E7QGNALRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s quite a good study, both the methodology and the message,” said Martin Gibala, an exercise scientist at McMaster University in Canada, who studies exercise intensity but was not involved with this research. The results suggest that, even if you choose not to exercise, sprinkling a little moderate or vigorous everyday activity into your life “can have meaningful health effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPelYxTVlQaHE4cUFna1ZCY3BvMmpEOGRoZlpuV2tfOXpGNC1nQVhDMFhYQWZNcHMxQ0ltdmFSR01Ic2FWb0xySG8xM2tYcDlVcWl0R2tic2l1UW11bTB2VHJpZGJPblJCanpDM2tUWUl6UEx1Q3A5ak1nZVJOeDg0S2hLa3lMLUtMT1E</guid></item><item><title>1岁的麻疹患者可能在7个地点暴露了其他人：英厄姆官员-底特律新闻 | 1-year-old with measles may have exposed others at 7 locations: Ingham officials - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPUkdWYk9mLTJxSHF5cFpueEJxT0stNG83LXFTWWVsQWNCQllmSjFFNVJCYkNubHhiamkyNFVMWno1NU5ZNVctdlhhZTl5UjhHTnE3SnBnZ2pHUk9ZSFM3Yk1yRHJBN25kVE03cTFtQkk2Q2dORDlZbERKWVF6anE5aU1pUGEwU0ZSMkl1M3JvNkJ6bGI0NFM4a2MtUUhuampNYk80NTYxVld0SG9rdHBQbWhtS054eHE1U25hb1dVcVU2YXJZWG9lbGFXT3NoNURhNzdJSEJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health officials on Monday confirmed the state's fifth measles case of the year in a one-year-old girl from Ingham County, who may have exposed others to it at multiple locations during a four-day period, according to the county health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is a very contagious disease spread through person-to-person contact and the air, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The child may have exposed people at seven different locations between April 4 and 8, and the Ingham County Health Department is working to identify and notify them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are closely monitoring this case and taking it very seriously," Dr. Nike Shoyinka, Ingham County Medical Health Officer, said in the news release. "Measles is highly contagious and can lead to severe complications, especially in young children, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Possible exposure sites are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Tractor Supply, W Grand River Ave, Lansing, on April 4 between 6 p.m. and 8:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Okemos Farmer’s Market in Meridian Mall, on April 5 between 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Aldi in Okemos, on April 5 between 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Towar Hart Baptist Church in East Lansing on April 6 between 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Toscana Restaurant in Lansing on April 6 between 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;Michigan State University Community Music School on April 8 between 5:30 p.m. and 7:35 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;University of Michigan Health Sparrow Lansing Emergency Department on April 8 between 6 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who may have been exposed to measles should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a red rash on the face and rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If symptoms develop, patients should contact their health care provider immediately, the Ingham County Health Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People can contract measles by being in a room where an infected person has also been up to two hours after they left, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is the best protection against the disease, and two doses are roughly 97% effective at preventing measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Children can receive their first dose of the measles vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and their second between the ages of four and six years old. Anyone who is not vaccinated is at risk for serious health complications from measles, especially children below the age of five, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ingham County Health Department encouraged everyone to check their vaccination status and is providing doses at its immunization clinic in Lansing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The MMR vaccine is safe, effective, and remains our best defense. Two doses provide 97%protection," Shoyinka said in the news release.

Animal control was called, but was unable to find that raccoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on April 9, another resident had an altercation with a raccoon while walking, officials said. Animal control was able to pick up the raccoon and send it for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, it was confirmed by the state Department of Health and Human Services that the raccoon tested positive for rabies, the Camden County Health Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal control officer, dog owner and the resident on a walk were all notified. The Camden County Department of Health and Human Services received proof of vaccination for the dog, it received a rabies booster shot and will be under confinement and observation for 45 days, officials said. All potentially exposed residents have started to receive post-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PEP) for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although rabies is a serious illness, it can be prevented by early treatment,” said Commissioner Virginia Betteridge, liaison to the Camden County Health Department. “If you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal it is important that you seek immediate medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betteridge urged county residents to observe a few simple rules, including acting responsibly as a pet owner: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep vaccinations up to date for all dogs, cats, and ferrets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pets under direct supervision so they do not come in contact with wild animals. If your pet is bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact your local animal control agency to remove any stray animals from your neighborhood. They may be unvaccinated and could be infected by the disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Betteridge said it is also important to avoid direct contact with unfamiliar animals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 16:03:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPV1BHWmowdFdYdkdEMWVTbFlRXzI5NG85a1VHR0ZpRDhkc0h6LUI0REpiOVpjdFA2NXZYSjFDdENZc0pvcmJvM3pFeVhtek5hckRFd3VLLW45enV0V3M4enVOckxHS09sbnEzV2hhUUVOUHRBb3JTZEdJVHR6ZFQ3RC1pNmJaRHhmTXpmOTZJYkI4eVRkTnpWQ1VLd3laWkU5ekM0d9IBugFBVV95cUxNRUZsZTRiWm9jU3BWQm1iMmxCZFpUMmE5UTNoZ1VlLXhkUndHNlk2VU0wcXNOamU5MHY4ZG82ckpzMENPMnJCRkZuTFVzVWJmWldMMEp3WWdfMThBT0lNYklKcy1LVmZ3VTJKakxQeEZmdWpvcU0zaC1TQ1lKUGpNQk9ienhGRkxleDJTdmt4eFlITV9MMjNlZDljcC0zcUVkMXpELWUyX3llZmxMdFZEREp6bktPN0dFMGc</guid></item><item><title>我们即将推出通用过敏疗法--Vox | We’re on the verge of a universal allergy cure - Vox</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNTFFvMzZaSnBsSDZOX05wOWhHSEt2WWVQNmN4eDJyVkRIZVBPZWNuYVV6QUtXRFhxdU9pbnRfcTIwYldIcllJeXNWczBuVnVKUUFqeHJsRnFraEhIMzQ3OU5FU2lmQjdRWmwyd1lyNTFFVGROaUZGQXFhTzFlQl9UUEln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrixz"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you’re bothered by allergies every spring, you may pop a Benadryl or Claritin most mornings to make the days tolerable. Two-thirds of Americans &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/a-growing-number-of-americans-consider-medications-for-springtime-allergy-relief/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; spring allergies, and about 4 in 10 say they take an allergy medication several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But those medicines, while valuable, don’t exactly fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00237.x"&gt;One 2001 study&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom found 60 percent of people who took some kind of over-the-counter medication for allergies reported they were not satisfied with how it managed their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nasal sprays are not exactly enjoyable or easy to operate. Allergy medicines have to be taken every day if you deal with serious hay fever, and they can produce, ironically, tiredness for some people during this season of renewal. A missed dose can lead to a day of hacking and sneezing. Oh, and the more you take them, the less likely they are to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A century ago, antihistamines were a revolution in allergy treatment. But now, we’re on the cusp of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Omalizumab, sold as Xolair, is an asthma medication that was approved more than 20 years ago, but it has proven successful in treating seasonal allergies in recent preliminary trials. So successful, in fact, that now some doctors in the US are prescribing it for certain patients during hay fever season. It is an injection, rather than a pill or a spray, that’s given a couple of weeks before pollen and grass levels start to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One obvious benefit is you get a single shot and enjoy your spring. But even better, omalizumab can forestall allergic reactions at the source. That means an injection could stop &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; allergic reactions — not only seasonal allergies but &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt; (such as peanuts) and insect allergies for a prolonged period of time. This class of treatment — monoclonal antibodies, special artificial proteins that carry instructions to the body’s immune system — have the potential to be a genuine all-in-one allergy wonder drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The biggest advantage of antibody-based therapeutics is that they offer the potential to target the underlying pathways driving allergic reactions in general,” said Sayantani Sindher, a clinical associate professor at Stanford University’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research. “This means antibody-based therapies will simultaneously impact all of the patient’s allergens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Large clinical trials are underway in China and Japan, which could lead to omalizumab’s approval in those countries for seasonal allergies. The next generation of monoclonal antibody allergy treatments is already in the works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-monoclonal-antibodies-could-stop-allergy-season-before-it-starts" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How monoclonal antibodies could stop allergy season before it starts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the United States, the use of monoclonal antibodies started with doctors studying and prescribing preexisting treatments “off label” — meaning these are drugs that were actually developed for something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Asthma and seasonal allergies often occur in tandem, which made omalizumab an obvious candidate for a new approach to allergy treatment. The drug had also separately proven effective in treating food allergies, adding to evidence that it had the right properties to stop seasonal allergies at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The treatment has demonstrated significantly better outcomes than antihistamines in small randomized trials, requiring only one dose two weeks before pollen and grass season. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clt2.12094"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; reported that patients who received a 300 mg injection of Xolair experienced fewer symptoms and fewer days that required a daily antihistamine or other medication; the patients also reported a better quality of life during the allergy season. Their symptoms were particularly improved during the worst pollen days when compared to the people who only took a daily medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When pollen and other allergens emerge every year and enter your body through your eyes, ears, or nose while you’re enjoying the crisp spring air, your body’s immune system overreacts. Immunoglobulin, proteins that are supposed to identify and attack parasites or a virus, instead go after the otherwise harmless allergen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the immunoglobulin attacks the allergen, your body releases histamine, a chemical critical to inflammation (which, again, is really important when you are actually exposed to a dangerous parasite or virus). That inflammation then creates all that mucus and sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Monoclonal antibodies stop that process before it begins. They deliver artificial proteins that carry instructions to your immune system to block the receptors that create allergic reactions and prevent the overresponse that releases histamine in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Artificially altered antibodies have been around for decades, with different iterations being developed to respond to new health threats. Monoclonal antibodies were developed for &lt;a href="/science-and-health/23495149/covid-19-treatment-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-drug"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic and recently provided the platform for &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23800167/rsv-shot-infants-fda-antibodies-vaccine-flu-health"&gt;an RSV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dupixent.com/"&gt;Dupilumab&lt;/a&gt; (another monoclonal antibody treatment used for skin rashes, asthma, and a lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe called COPD) targets a different receptor but has likewise shown promising results in studies so far. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29355679/"&gt;In a large 2018 study&lt;/a&gt;, asthma patients who suffer from seasonal allergies received a 300 mg injection every two weeks and showed significant improvements in their nasal blockage. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(21)02060-1/fulltext"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; fewer allergy symptoms among both people with allergic asthma and people without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Monoclonal antibody injections superficially resemble allergy vaccines, which have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/710243786/seasonal-sniffles-immunotherapy-tablets-can-replace-allergy-shots-for-some-aller"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; more aggressively in recent years. Those shots as well as oral tablets that work in the same way function differently: They expose people to small amounts of the actual allergen, giving their bodies a chance to develop natural immunity to it. They can unlock more durable resistance to specific allergies — but they can only treat one allergy at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You may also need to go to the doctor once a week for a month or longer during the initial treatment course.

In early April, the final stage of one clinical trial found the following results after four weeks: Patients who had still reported symptoms after taking the standard-of-care treatment and then received a monoclonal antibody injection were much more likely to report mild or no nasal symptoms (62 percent) than people who were taking the placebo (39 percent). They scored significantly better on oral symptoms and other measures of efficacy without serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The drug in the clinical trial, Stapokibart, was recently &lt;a href="https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5945250"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; for seasonal allergy treatment in China, and its developer, Keymed, has &lt;a href="https://endpts.com/how-keymed-steered-the-china-to-us-newco-model-in-biotech/#:~:text=Keymed%20Biosciences%20is%20a%20prime,four%20NewCo%20deals%20since%20July."&gt;premised its business&lt;/a&gt; on developing and gaining approval for treatments in that country and then bringing them to the US.

So far, doctors have been prescribing this “off label” — meaning it has proven safe to use for a different purpose, but the science on its effectiveness for allergies is preliminary. A prescription is ultimately at your doctor’s discretion, but if you suffer from severe allergies, it could be a fit for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here are some things to consider asking your physician if you’re interested in this kind of treatment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Are there other existing treatments they would advise trying first?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Do I have another condition for which Xolair is intended to treat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What steps should we take for my health plan to cover the cost?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With antihistamines and nasal sprays, you must regularly buy them yourself and repeatedly remember to take them correctly to stave off allergy symptoms. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00237.x"&gt;That 2001 study in the UK&lt;/a&gt; found that many people who suffered seasonal allergy symptoms nonetheless did a poor job of taking medication as they should: Among the 54 percent of people who were experiencing poor allergy symptoms, 70 percent didn’t use the conventional allergy medicines according to the clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But for allergy sufferers to make the jump from something like Claritin to an annual allergy shot that works even better, health insurance coverage will be critical: The list price on omalizumab is &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/xolair"&gt;$1,500 a pop&lt;/a&gt;. This would be a new cost to health plans because patients often bear their own over-the-counter antihistamine med costs. Off-label coverage of any drug, including omalizumab for seasonal allergies, can be fickle. Some popular plans, such as United Healthcare, &lt;a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/xolair-omalizumab.pdf"&gt;are not currently covering&lt;/a&gt; the drug for that use at this time because they consider it unproven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As more research comes in and more products come on the market, the insurers’ value proposition may change.

Scientists are investigating whether these small particles have any lasting impact on cellular health, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that consistent contact with these particles might correlate with certain changes in the body linked to age-related conditions. Some experts think this interaction warrants closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was co-authored by Tan Ma from &lt;a href="http://www.rcees.ac.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Beijing Environmental Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, who has examined how these substances disrupt important cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-plastic-exposure"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tracing plastic exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People encounter &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-pose-a-greater-threat-to-some-ocean-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; in items like synthetic fabrics or disposable packaging. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; are even smaller and can remain hidden in many everyday settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have spotted them in water sources and even in common household dust. The concern is that humans might accumulate them across decades with unknown consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-premature-aging"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Signs of premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b00423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; propose that ongoing contact with these particles can stir up harmful cell processes, including persistent inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/even-mild-inflammation-can-majorly-damage-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; often appears as people age, which might speed up natural aging. This emerging &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-024-05731-5"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; has many scientists asking if these plastics add extra stress at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/damaged-mitochondria-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; help power daily functions by creating energy for cells. They also help process byproducts that might damage tissues if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts see these organelles as a key indicator of healthy aging. Interference in their normal operations may link to conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-and-premature-aging"&gt;Microplastics and premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; that small plastic bits can enter cells through multiple pathways. Once they get inside, they might shift how cells manage waste or handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disturbance can weaken some of the checkpoints that keep cells balanced. If mitochondria lose efficiency, the body might face a higher load of problems related to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that they are there and are transported throughout the body, but we don’t know yet if they can cross the blood-brain barrier,” said Dr. Sherri Mason, a noted researcher on microplastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about how these particles gather in the body are driving new studies. Lab tests aim to see how these fragments move through different organs throughout a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specialists think that data will help regulators set safer standards for plastic production. Others emphasize personal measures, like filtered water, to lower daily exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oxidative-stress-from-foreign-particles"&gt;Oxidative stress from foreign particles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advanced years, certain disorders may accelerate if &lt;a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-microbiology/chapter/cellular-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular defenses&lt;/a&gt; falter. Scientists have linked these mini-plastics to changes often found in cardiovascular or neurological ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; can emerge when foreign particles disrupt normal metabolic cycles. That stress might make the aging process even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental agencies may reconsider plastic guidelines in light of these findings. Calls for improved waste management reflect a broader move toward reducing pollution at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers propose stricter rules for single-use products. They also suggest more robust screening of manufacturing methods to cut back on plastic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avoiding-microplastics-and-premature-aging"&gt;Avoiding microplastics and premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain people might opt for reusable items to minimize exposure. Others explore technologies that trap or break down plastic waste before it enters the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point out that these moves could help until more significant policy shifts take hold. Public awareness remains a big part of sparking any meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-influence-of-microplastics-on-aging"&gt;Influence of microplastics on aging &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field is evolving, so scientists still lack a complete picture of how microplastics might trigger &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-cause-premature-aging-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;premature aging&lt;/a&gt;. Ongoing trials could reveal whether there is a direct cause and effect with early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful studies will quantify how different doses affect cells over time. Findings might also identify groups most at risk for higher accumulations of these plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This attention to small plastic debris reflects rising worries about synthetic waste in society. Public health experts want to see if new tests can clarify whether such particles directly influence advanced age ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-research-is-needed"&gt;Further research is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many labs are joining forces to track the pathways of these materials. This wave of collaboration may give us a broader sense of how plastics connect with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aging-hotspot-found-in-the-brain-may-hold-the-key-to-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With older populations growing worldwide, it is vital to understand everything that might influence later stages of life. Researchers suggest that these tiny particles deserve more scrutiny for the sake of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing work will aim to uncover any hidden risks or unexpected benefits that come from our frequent use of plastics. The future of aging research may hinge on how we handle these discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152500122X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; point to a connection between these materials and shifts in cellular energy production. These findings highlight how damaged mitochondria may ramp up age-linked health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who monitor &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ocean-plastic-pollution-has-become-a-global-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; say safer disposal methods and product alternatives might be ways to cut down on microscopic fragments. Taking small protective steps could be wise until deeper studies clarify the exact dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027869152500122X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food and Chemical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:41:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQU184Vks5aTBaTEltZm9CYl84cndzWHFZUU1pX0hER3I1eUlkMUMxZmtIZEp0MkpMdjJ6UUFnQUNaTm5CaDlVWHgyYjVUWHhZclI1c2VGMzU2Q3NsYlFSdXdRZlpvRVNlQ1JicW1NUGVhRE40MWVydkxuSVQ2cWRaZG5hR0d0VG0wUFZNWkM4OFE</guid></item><item><title>“食肉”外阴感染呈上升趋势，医生警告- Gizmodo | ‘Flesh-Eating’ Infections of the Vulva Are on the Rise, Doctors Warn - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVUo0VlNVZk9HcXgtWWRpcERxQi0tbzlFenJkbXNXOTVrRkpyTjZDNVZrUl9KVEJVdlhMUnQ0YzNFVE5vN0Ffejl0UDBsMml6bXg4QzNmVmxxbU02S204WDhrclNVdmVaR0lmd0RvMklvdXZCQkRWSWltY1hyclEyRm5wUHZzN3hGT0FxcnlQSl9lN0lmYW03OEZGcDE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A rare but horrific kind of infection might be on the rise. Gynecologists in the UK have begun to see an alarming increase in people with necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva, a.k.a. the “flesh-eating” disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust detailed three such cases in a paper &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/18/4/e263792"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in BMJ Case Reports. All three women were hospitalized, and one died as a result. These cases are part of a growing trend in the UK, the doctors say, and infections that can cause necrotizing fasciitis are increasing in the U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23103-necrotizing-fasciitis"&gt;Necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; is a serious type of bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues underneath our skin (particularly fascia, hence the name). While the appearance of this infection might resemble freshly-chewed flesh, the bacteria aren’t actually eating it away. Once this destruction starts, it can rapidly spread and trigger other life-threatening complications like sepsis. People can die from necrotizing fasciitis in &lt;a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-disease#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20very%20severe,a%20minor%20cut%20or%20bruise."&gt;as little as 12 hours&lt;/a&gt; after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are several different species of bacteria that can potentially cause necrotizing fasciitis, it remains a rare occurrence overall. But the report authors say they’ve noticed a significant uptick lately in cases involving the vulva (the external parts of the female genitalia) at their hospital, which includes the three described in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In two of the cases, the women were diagnosed with vulvar necrotizing fasciitis in the emergency room. In the third, the woman developed it as a complication from an infected surgical wound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One woman had seen a doctor five days earlier after noticing a spot on her mons pubis, and was prescribed antibiotics. But the treatment failed to clear the infection, and by the time she was hospitalized, the infection had spread throughout her labia majora, lower abdomen, and left hip. Despite surgical removal of her infected and necrotic tissue (also known as debridement) and intensive care support, the woman died of sepsis just 28 hours after her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other two women survived their ordeal, though not without serious difficulty. Both needed “extensive surgical debridement” and one woman underwent three separate surgeries to remove tissue, which later required reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These cases are only part of a worrying pattern that the doctors have noticed. They identified 20 cases treated at their hospital between 2022 and 2024, compared to 18 reported in the entire previous decade. And they’re not the only ones spotting an overall rise in “flesh-eating” infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, for instance, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832277"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the rate of invasive group A &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus &lt;/em&gt;(GAS) infections—the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/about/necrotizing-fasciitis.html#:~:text=Experts%20believe%20group%20A%20Streptococcus%20(group%20A%20strep%20bacteria)%20are%20the%20most%20common%20cause"&gt;most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;—had more than doubled in the U.S. between 2013 and 2022. Several countries in Europe, including the UK, have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/12-12-2022-increase-in-invasive-group-a-streptococcal-infections-among-children-in-europe--including-fatalities#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20European%20countries,under%2010%20years%20of%20age."&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; a recent increase in GAS infections.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though necrotizing fasciitis remains rare in general, the doctors hope their report can help alert other ob-gyns to the possibility of these cases, particularly since speedy medical care is needed to prevent death. “With our review of three cases, we aim to raise awareness of this condition among gynecologists, who have limited familiarity with it,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These infections can be fatal anywhere they start, but vulvar necrotizing fasciitis is especially deadly, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25"&gt;a mortality rate as high as 50%&lt;/a&gt; without timely treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:35:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVUo0VlNVZk9HcXgtWWRpcERxQi0tbzlFenJkbXNXOTVrRkpyTjZDNVZrUl9KVEJVdlhMUnQ0YzNFVE5vN0Ffejl0UDBsMml6bXg4QzNmVmxxbU02S204WDhrclNVdmVaR0lmd0RvMklvdXZCQkRWSWltY1hyclEyRm5wUHZzN3hGT0FxcnlQSl9lN0lmYW03OEZGcDE</guid></item></channel></rss>
