			&lt;p&gt;A powerful new treatment has emerged in efforts to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-cholesterol-diets-speed-up-cancer-tumour-growth-100-times"&gt;high cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and the associated risk of heart health problems. In a new trial, the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlicitide_decanoate"&gt;enlicitide decanoate&lt;/a&gt; was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol by almost 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team tested the drug in a randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving people with an inherited condition that causes dangerously high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) – the 'bad' type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heterozygous &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22067-familial-hypercholesterolemia"&gt;familial hypercholesterolemia&lt;/a&gt; (HeFH) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is characterized by elevated levels of LDL-C from birth," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;Drugs That Lower Cholesterol May Also Reduce Dementia Risk, Says Huge New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 293 participants with HeFH, who were already taking cholesterol-lowering &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; that weren't having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A once-daily enlicitide decanoate pill was shown to reduce LDL-C by an average of 58.2 percent after 24 weeks. Those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;given a placebo&lt;/a&gt; instead actually saw a slight rise in the levels of LDL-C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In adults with HeFH, enlicitide is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for lowering the level of LDL-C," the study authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More positive results: side effects were limited and similar between the treatment and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; groups, and the benefits of the experimental drug remained consistent over the 52-week trial. Key cholesterol biomarkers associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-factor-in-walking-improves-your-heart-health-more-than-your-step-count"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in the treatment group too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182563" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg" alt="Cholesterol chart" class="wp-image-182563 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CholesterolChart-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182563" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;LDL cholesterol was significantly reduced in those who took the treatment. (Ballantyne et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlicitide decanoate is what's known as a PCSK9 inhibitor: Essentially, this means it limits the effectiveness of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSK9"&gt;PCSK9&lt;/a&gt;, a blood protein that can interfere with the liver's efforts to clear away LDL-C, causing a buildup. The treatment is basically making sure the liver can do its &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;cholesterol-clearing job&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are already PCSK9 inhibitors available, but they're administered via injection. Patients are more likely to stick to courses of drugs given in pill form, and here, 98 percent of the trial participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adherence with both the once-daily oral intervention and fasting instructions for dosing was notably high in both treatment groups," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High LDL-C is a problem for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.891929"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, not just those with HeFH. The main negative consequence is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, restricting blood flow and limiting how much blood reaches the heart and brain. Heart attacks and strokes become &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, next the researchers want to see if this reduction in LDL-C has any meaningful impact on the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and test the drug more broadly. However, at least for this subgroup of people, we may now have a way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;lowering LDL-C&lt;/a&gt; back to regular levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;Eating Eggs Can Actually Lower Bad Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to get regulatory approval before it can be prescribed, but a phase 3 trial like this one is a key step – and the results are very encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without timely intervention to reduce plasma LDL-C levels," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt;, "individuals with HeFH face an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to cumulative lifetime exposure to elevated LDL-C levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                Many people who take GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss experience unpleasant side effects. Brain scientists are trying to find ways to avoid them. &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have shed pounds with help from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But people who take these drugs often experience unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"They lose weight, which is a positive thing," says &lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/warren-yacawych" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Warren Yacawych&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan, "but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, Yacawych and other researchers held a session to describe their efforts to understand and solve the side-effect problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The weight-loss products are called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They work by mimicking a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could tweak these drugs to suppress appetite without making people queasy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center," Yacawych says. "It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's very challenging," Yacawych says, "to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A possible workaround came from a team led by &lt;a href="https://endocrinology.uw.edu/people/faculty/blevins-j" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ernie Blevins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/28/1152313319/a-new-study-casts-doubt-on-oxytocins-role-as-a-love-hormone" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxytocin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Not just nausea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem," says &lt;a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/DerekDaniels.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Derek Daniels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We had a happy accident in the lab," Daniels says. "And the happy accident involved a rat called the &lt;a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/2/ENEURO.0150-15.2016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brattleboro rat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that "target good places but not bad places," Daniels says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Appetite and addiction&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for "rewarding food, like a burger," says &lt;a href="https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/ali-d-guler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali D. Güler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Your morning routine probably feels harmless enough. Splash some water, apply your products, get on with your day. But what if I told you that some of your most automatic daily habits are actually working against you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years not really thinking about how I treated my face. I was too busy, too focused on other things, and honestly, I figured aging was just inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started noticing changes that seemed to happen faster than they should. Fine lines that appeared overnight. Skin that looked tired even when I wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I started digging into the research. Turns out, science has quite a bit to say about the everyday things we do that speed up aging. And most of them are so ingrained in our routines that we don't even register them as choices anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Touching your face constantly throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you rested your chin in your hand today? Rubbed your eyes? Absentmindedly touched your cheek while thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became aware of this habit during a particularly stressful period when I was working long hours. I'd catch myself in video calls with my hand on my face, over and over. Didn't think much of it until I read the &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a13196/why-you-shouldnt-touch-your-face/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on how our hands transfer bacteria, oils, and environmental pollutants directly onto our skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you touch your face, you're potentially introducing irritants that trigger inflammation. And inflammation is one of the primary drivers of premature aging. Your hands have been everywhere: keyboards, door handles, your phone. All that gets transferred straight to your pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this habit takes serious awareness because it's so automatic. I started by simply noticing when I did it, without judgment. That awareness alone cut down my face-touching by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days or when you're indoors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: when was the last time you wore sunscreen on a rainy day? Or while working from home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think sunscreen was only necessary for beach days or summer. The research tells a completely different story. UV rays penetrate clouds and windows. They're hitting your skin right now, even if you're inside reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/news/survey-shows-sun-protection-lacking-in-winter"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; reports that up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds. And UVA rays, the ones responsible for aging, pass right through glass. So that sunny spot by your window where you like to sit? Your skin is getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really got my attention was learning about cumulative UV damage. It's not the occasional sunburn that ages you fastest. It's the daily, unremarkable exposure that adds up over decades. Those few minutes walking to your car. The light coming through your windshield during your commute. It all counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started treating sunscreen like brushing my teeth. Non-negotiable, every single day, regardless of weather or plans. The difference in my skin over just a few months was noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Using hot water to wash your face&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something satisfying about washing your face with hot water, especially after a long day. It feels cleansing, almost therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what that hot water is actually doing: stripping away your skin's natural protective oils. Your skin has a barrier function that keeps moisture in and irritants out. Hot water damages that barrier, leaving your skin vulnerable to dehydration and environmental stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8778033/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hot water increases transepidermal water loss. Essentially, your skin can't hold onto moisture as effectively. And dehydrated skin shows every line, every wrinkle, every sign of aging more prominently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this shift when I started paying attention to how my skin felt after washing. Hot water left it tight and uncomfortable. Once I switched to lukewarm water, that tight feeling disappeared. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal temperature is tepid, barely warm to the touch. It might not feel as satisfying initially, but your skin will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Sleeping on your side or stomach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one surprised me because I'd been a side sleeper my entire adult life. Turns out, the way you sleep matters more than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press your face into a pillow night after night, you're creating creases and folds in your skin. These "sleep wrinkles" are temporary, but as we get older and our skin becomes less elastic, they &lt;a href="https://medicine.uq.edu.au/article/2024/05/sleep-wrinkles-are-real-here%E2%80%99s-how-they-leave-their%C2%A0mark"&gt;become permanent lines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing a deeper line on the left side of my face, exactly where my face met the pillow each night. That was my wake-up call. I've been slowly training myself to sleep on my back, which is harder than it sounds after decades of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even switching to a silk or satin pillowcase can help. These materials create less friction against your skin compared to cotton. It's a small change that adds up over thousands of nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Applying products by rubbing and tugging at your skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you apply your moisturizer? If you're rubbing it in vigorously or pulling at your skin, you might want to reconsider your technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think I needed to really work products into my skin for them to be effective. Rubbing in circles, pulling upward, putting in effort. The reality is that your facial skin is delicate, and all that tugging stretches it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it this way: your skin has elasticity, but it's not infinite. Every time you pull and stretch, you're challenging that elasticity. Do it multiple times a day for years, and you're essentially training your skin to stay stretched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-apply-moisturizer-6824874#:~:text=Aim%20for%20about%20a%20quarter,to%20do%20this%20at%20night."&gt;Dermatologists&lt;/a&gt; recommend gentle patting or pressing motions instead. Let your products sink in through light pressure rather than friction. This approach is particularly important for the delicate skin around your eyes, which shows damage more quickly than anywhere else on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed my entire skincare application routine to gentle pressing motions. It felt weird at first because I wasn't "doing" as much. But my skin responded well to the gentler treatment almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Skimping on sleep regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're busy, sleep is often the first thing to go. I went through years of functioning on five or six hours a night, thinking I could make it up later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But your skin repairs itself during sleep. That's not metaphorical, it's biological fact. During deep sleep, your body increases blood flow to your skin and rebuilds collagen. Miss out on sleep, and you miss out on this crucial repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266053/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; found that poor sleepers showed increased signs of skin aging, including fine lines, uneven pigmentation, and reduced skin elasticity. They also recovered more slowly from environmental stressors like sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really struck me was learning that even one night of poor sleep affects your skin's barrier function. But chronic sleep deprivation? That creates a cascade of aging effects that compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that on weeks when I prioritized seven to eight hours of sleep, my skin looked visibly different. Brighter, more even, less puffy. It was like getting a spa treatment just from sleeping properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Eating sugar and refined carbs throughout the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This connection between diet and skin aging wasn't obvious to me until I started looking into the research on glycation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what happens: when you eat sugar and refined carbohydrates, they break down into glucose in your bloodstream. Excess glucose molecules attach to proteins in your body, including collagen and elastin, through a process called glycation. This creates harmful molecules called advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AGEs literally make your skin less elastic and more prone to wrinkles and sagging. &lt;a href="https://www.unitypoint.org/news-and-articles/the-link-between-sugar-and-aging"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that glycation contributes significantly to skin aging and that dietary choices directly impact this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to snack on sugary foods throughout the day without thinking about it. A cookie here, some candy there, refined carbs at every meal. When I became vegan and started paying more attention to what I ate, I naturally cut back on processed sugars. The change in my skin was one of the first things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you can never have sugar. Just be aware that regular consumption of high-sugar foods is doing more than affecting your energy levels. It's affecting how your skin ages at a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, aging is natural and inevitable. There's no magic routine that stops time completely. But understanding what accelerates the process gives you the power to make different choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me most about this list is how automatic these habits are. We're not consciously deciding to age our skin faster. We're just going through our days, doing what we've always done, not realizing the cumulative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know better, you can do better. You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit from this list and work on changing it. Once that feels natural, move to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked on all of these over the past few years, and I can honestly say my skin looks better now than it did five years ago. Not because of expensive products or treatments, but because I stopped doing the everyday things that were working against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your face is with you for life. Treating it with a little more awareness and care isn't vanity. It's just smart maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Doctors often emphasize that prioritizing your mental health is important.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to doctors, there is one particular aspect of your health that is often overlooked — and that's pelvic floor health for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials and doctors describe pelvic floor health as maintaining strong and flexible muscles that support your bladder, bowels, and uterus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common disorders concerning your pelvic floor include leaking urine, leaking stool, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clinic in Little Rock has been working to change that and encourages men and women in Central Arkansas to prioritize their pelvic floor health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Sally Oliphant is a doctor at Arkansas Urogynecology and Women’s Health who explained that pelvic floor disorders are often overlooked and under-addressed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think urinary issues may be something women ignore, and think is normal after childbirth or with aging,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why her clinic has been working to alleviate this burden for men and women by utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So we have a cystoscopy tower, and that's how we're able to look diagnostically in the bladder with a camera, and then do some of the treatments for urinary incontinence and inject the bladder with Botox, through a cystoscope. We can also inject the urethra with stress incontinence," she described.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic estimates nearly one in three women over the age of 20 may have a form of pelvic floor dysfunction. Though they suspect the number is much higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One habit that I think a lot of women get into is that we're always in a hurry, and you're emptying your bladder and you're pushing to get it done quickly. And that's really not a good bladder habit to try and push to get all that bladder out,” Dr. Oliphant said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she suggests taking your time, listening to your body, and recognizing when you need to check in with doctors.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's really important not to neglect the health of the vagina, the bladder, and the pelvic floor," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

with her and searched for solutions that wouldn’t require her to put in additional effort in the kitchen (after all, she was already going to host the entire family), but it quickly blew up into what her husband called “ridiculous high school drama.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, she asked the internet to weigh in on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;This woman got a text from her sister-in-law, asking

healthy amount of physical activity in your daily life can make a difference in your probability of becoming fertile if you are experiencing problems with ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/11/changes-in-diet-and-lifestyle-may-help-prevent-infertility/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the Harvard School of Public Health, which comprised nearly 18,000 women, discovered a higher incidence of ovulatory disorder in those who consumed more trans fats, sugar from carbohydrates, and animal proteins. On the other hand, those who consumed more iron, fiber, and protein from vegetables had a higher fertility diet score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, “studies have shown that consuming a certain quantity of monounsaturated fats during the IVF cycle increased the success rate by three and a half times, as opposed to women who don’t eat good plant-based fats during that period,” &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/getting-pregnant/fertility/what-to-eat-to-get-pregnant/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alisa Vitti, integrative nutritionist and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WomanCode-Perfect-Amplify-Fertility-Supercharge/dp/006213079X?tag=vilofjoy-20" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WomanCode: Perfect Your Cycle, Amplify Your Fertility, Supercharge Your Sex Drive, and Become a Power Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, if you’re having continued trouble, your doctor may suggest limiting dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re being exposed to dairy in mass quantities that’s more hormonally-driven, meaning the production of cow dairy has become very chemically manipulated,” Vitti explains. “These excess hormones may disrupt the conversation that the brain is trying to have with the endocrine system, particularly your ovaries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it can be overwhelming for someone to devise a menu that’s suitable for everyone coming over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving, despite its &lt;a

			&lt;p&gt;A new chemical compound has shown promise for treating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182363" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. Its effects in a rat model of the disease were impressive, and the biochemists who discovered it are eager to progress to in-human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. And while it's still unclear whether these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert"&gt;plaques cause the disease's symptoms, or are merely a side-effect,&lt;/a&gt; they remain a major research focus for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that current treatment options for Alzheimer's extend only to symptom relief, the race is on to find drugs that may actually tackle the disease from its roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;Scientists Found 2 Existing Drugs Can Reverse Alzheimer's Brain Damage in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new compound works by stripping excess copper out of the harmful beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About a decade ago, international studies began to point to the influence of copper ions as an aggregator of beta-amyloid plaques," &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/researchers-develop-chemical-compound-with-potential-against-alzheimers-disease/56422"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Giselle Cerchiaro from Federal University of the ABC (UFABC) in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was discovered that genetic mutations and changes in enzymes that act in the transport of copper in cells could lead to the accumulation of the element in the brain, favoring the aggregation of these plaques. Thus, the regulation of copper homeostasis [balance] has become one of the focuses for the treatment of Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182456" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182456" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-642x533.jpg" alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-182456" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-642x533.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-768x637.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422-600x498.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/56422.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182456" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new compound can strip beta-amyloid clumps of excess copper.

But for those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-deposits-of-copper-and-magnetic-iron-in-alzheimer-s-brains"&gt;who do have an excess&lt;/a&gt;, scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2362.2002.00933.x"&gt;have long suspected&lt;/a&gt; that returning the brain's copper levels to normal could help improve some symptoms, especially brain damage from oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested which compounds in a set of nine could best pull the copper from brain plaques. These compounds – eight &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imine"&gt;imines&lt;/a&gt; (organic compounds containing a carbon-nitrogen double bond) and one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoline"&gt;quinoline&lt;/a&gt;-based – were first put through a virtual, 'in silico' experiment, which revealed two of the imines (which the researchers labelled as L09 and L10) and the quinoline-based compound (here dubbed L11) as suitable candidates for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer test suggested these three compounds should be able to pass the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-brain-barrier-guardian-shows-promise-against-alzheimers"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; (an essential hurdle for any in-brain therapy) and could potentially be given to patients as pills to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, mouse brain cells grown in a lab were exposed to each of the three candidate compounds for 24 hours, to test their toxicity. Compound L11 did the most damage to cells and showed signs of exacerbating oxidative stress: not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, L09 and L10 showed relatively low toxicity, while also protecting the cells' lipids and DNA from damage usually associated with the oxidative stress that accompanies beta-amyloid buildup.&lt;br&gt;

As well as restoring normal levels of copper in the hippocampus (the brain region best known for its role in short- and long-term memory), the compound also significantly reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The rats treated with this compound also performed much better in a maze activity designed to test their spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, compounds L09 and L11 had a much weaker impact in all measures.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cerchiaro and team are keen to move forward with clinical tests, which will give a clearer idea of how viable this treatment might be for human &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;Alzheimer's patients&lt;/a&gt;, of whom there are an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about/dementia-facts-figures/dementia-statistics/"&gt;55 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an extremely simple, safe, and effective molecule," Cerchiaro &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/researchers-develop-chemical-compound-with-potential-against-alzheimers-disease/56422"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "The compound we've developed is much less expensive than available drugs. Therefore, even if it only works for part of the population, since Alzheimer's disease has multiple causes, it'd represent a huge advance &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;over current options&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.5c00291"&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;My neighbor Margaret is 67 and has skin that honestly looks better than some people I know in their forties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, her sister visits from across the country a few times a year, and despite being three years younger, looks noticeably older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same genetics, completely different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting curious about this, I started paying closer attention to what people with great skin actually do versus what they think they're supposed to do. Turns out, a lot of us are unknowingly aging ourselves faster by sticking with outdated habits that no longer serve us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still doing these things, it might be time to reconsider your approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Using harsh, stripping cleansers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we were told to wash our faces until they felt "squeaky clean"? That tight, almost dry feeling after cleansing was supposed to mean your skin was actually clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that advice has aged about as well as some of those old skincare routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harsh cleansers strip away your skin's natural oils and damage the moisture barrier. After 60, your skin already produces less oil naturally, so stripping what little you have leaves your skin looking dull, dry, and yes, older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this mistake for years, using foaming cleansers that left my face feeling tight. Once I switched to gentler, creamy cleansers, the difference was noticeable within weeks. My skin looked plumper and more hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your cleanser should remove makeup and dirt without leaving your skin feeling parched. If your face feels tight after washing, that's not clean. That's damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Skipping sunscreen on cloudy days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you looked outside, seen gray skies, and decided to skip the SPF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about UV rays. They don't take days off just because you can't see the sun. Up to 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds, meaning you're still getting sun damage even when it's overcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women I know with the best skin in their sixties and beyond wear sunscreen every single day, regardless of the weather or whether they're planning to go outside. It's as automatic as brushing their teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun damage is cumulative. Every unprotected day adds up over the years, showing up as age spots, wrinkles, and uneven texture. You can use the most expensive serums and creams in the world, but if you're not protecting your skin from UV damage, you're basically taking one step forward and two steps back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make SPF 30 or higher part of your morning routine, rain or shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Over-exfoliating to chase that "glow"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exfoliation can be wonderful for your skin. The keyword here is "can be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many people over 60 are exfoliating daily, sometimes multiple times a day, because they've heard it gives you glowing skin. And while gentle exfoliation does help remove dead skin cells and brighten your complexion, overdoing it creates the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive exfoliation damages your skin barrier, increases sensitivity, and actually accelerates aging. Your skin becomes red, irritated, and more prone to wrinkles because you've stripped away the protective layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a phase in my late thirties where I was using a physical scrub in the morning and a chemical exfoliant at night. My skin looked inflamed and aged rather than glowing. When I scaled back to exfoliating just twice a week, everything calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we age, our skin becomes thinner and more delicate. It needs gentler treatment, not more aggressive scrubbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Applying products to dry skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you apply your serums and moisturizers to completely dry skin? This is one of those habits that seems logical but actually works against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly damp skin absorbs products much better than dry skin. When your skin is damp, it acts like a sponge, pulling hydration and active ingredients deeper into the layers where they can actually do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better approach is to pat your skin mostly dry after cleansing, leaving it slightly damp, then immediately apply your serums and moisturizers. This locks in that extra moisture and helps your products work more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's such a small change but makes a real difference in how hydrated and plump your skin looks. I started doing this a few years ago after reading about it, and I honestly can't believe I spent so many years doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your expensive skincare works better when you apply it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Using the same products year-round&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin's needs change with the seasons, but many people use the exact same routine in humid summer and dry winter alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In winter, indoor heating and cold outdoor air create a much drier environment. Your skin needs richer, more occlusive moisturizers to prevent moisture loss. In summer, humidity is higher and your skin might need lighter formulations to avoid feeling greasy or clogged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women with great skin adjust their routines seasonally. They might use a lighter gel cream in summer and switch to a heavier balm in winter. They add hydrating essences when the air is dry and scale back when it's humid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin is telling you what it needs if you pay attention. Tight and flaky in winter? Add more moisture. Breaking out in summer? Lighten up your products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One routine doesn't fit all seasons, especially as your skin becomes more sensitive with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Neglecting the neck and chest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick question: do you stop at your jawline when applying skincare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people do, and that's exactly why their neck and chest often look older than their face. The skin on your neck is thinner and more delicate than facial skin, with fewer oil glands. It shows age quickly if you're not taking care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see women all the time with beautifully maintained facial skin and necks that tell a completely different story. It's such a missed opportunity because treating these areas takes literally seconds more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you put on your face should go on your neck and chest too. Cleanser, serums, moisturizer, and especially sunscreen. Apply with upward strokes rather than dragging the delicate skin downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Sleeping on cotton pillowcases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a minor detail, but the surface you sleep on for 7-8 hours every night actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton pillowcases absorb moisture from your skin and can create friction that leads to sleep lines and wrinkles over time. After 60, when your skin is already losing elasticity and moisture, those sleep lines don't bounce back as quickly as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silk or satin pillowcases create less friction and don't absorb moisture from your skin and hair. They're gentler on aging skin and can help prevent those creases that eventually become permanent wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical about this until I tried it myself. The difference wasn't dramatic overnight, but after a few months, I noticed my skin looked less creased in the morning and felt more hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something that costs less than a decent moisturizer and lasts for years, it's worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this list, you might notice a theme. Most of these habits come from outdated advice or from doing too much rather than too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin after 60 needs a gentler, more thoughtful approach than it did in your twenties or even your forties. It's not about having a ten-step routine with the most expensive products. It's about understanding what your skin actually needs and dropping the habits that work against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking one habit from this list to change. Maybe it's finally committing to daily sunscreen or switching to a gentler cleanser. Small, consistent changes add up to significant results over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin has carried you through decades of life. Treat it with the care and respect it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

In the UK, about &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/26/young-people-england-common-mental-health-conditions-nhs-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a quarter of older teenagers&lt;/a&gt; and up to a fifth of younger children have anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance says under-18s with moderate to severe depression &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng134" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can be prescribed antidepressants alongside therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But a new review of trial data by academics in Austria and the UK concluded that fluoxetine, sold under the brand name of Prozac among others, is clinically no better than placebo drugs in treating depression in children, and should therefore no longer be prescribed to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors conducted a meta analysis of 12 large trials involving Prozac, published between 1997 and 2024, and concluded that fluoxetine improved children’s depressive symptoms so little as to not be considered clinically meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Consider the analogy of a weight-loss drug that is better than placebo at producing weight loss, but the difference is only 100 grams,” said Martin Plöderl, a clinical psychologist at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria, and lead author of the study. “This difference is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient or their doctors or produce any difference in their overall condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jclinepi.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Journal of Clinical Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, identified a “novelty bias” in early trials, which were likely to be more positive, while later studies fail to confirm these effects. It concludes that the potential risks of harmful side-effects of fluoxetine are likely to outweigh any potential clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most common side-effects experienced by children on antidepressants are weight gain, sleep disturbance and concentration problems. They can also increase suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d37217ba-3be1-4be7-b54b-2ece81436567" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Children detained under Mental Health Act held for hours in A&amp;amp;E departments","elementId":"d37217ba-3be1-4be7-b54b-2ece81436567","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/12/children-mental-health-act-accident-emergency-departments-england-wales"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The authors also examined clinical guidelines in the US and Canada and found that just as in the UK, they ignored evidence that Prozac was clinically equivalent to placebo and continued to recommend its use for children and adolescents with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mark Horowitz, an associate professor of psychiatry at Adelaide University and a co-author of the study, said: “Fluoxetine is clearly clinically equivalent to placebo in its benefits, but is associated with greater side effects and risks. It is difficult to see how anyone can justify exposing young people to a drug with known harms when it has no advantage over placebo in its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Guidelines should not recommend treatments that are equivalent to placebo. Many clinicians take the common-sense approach that we should seek to understand why the young person feels depressed and address the factors that are contributing to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Guidelines in the UK and around the world currently recommend treatments for children with depression that are not in line with the best evidence. This exposes young people to the risks of medication without any benefit over placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The long-term effects of antidepressants in children and adolescents were “poorly understood” and research among adults showed risks included serious side effects that may be long-term and in some cases persist after stopping the medication, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, a Nice spokesperson said: “Mental health is a priority for Nice and we recognise that depression in young people is a serious condition that affects each differently, which is why having a range of treatment options is essential for clinicians. Our guideline recommends a choice of psychological therapies as first line treatment options for children and young people with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nice recommends that children and young people with moderate or severe depression are reviewed by specialist teams. Antidepressants may be considered in combination with psychological therapy for moderate to severe depression in some cases and only under regular specialist supervision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Allan Young, chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Academic Faculty, said that the study should be interpreted with “caution”. “Clinical guidelines weigh many factors beyond average effect size, including safety, feasibility, and patient preferences. It is important that prescribed medication demonstrate consistent evidence and safety data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxNZUplWHI4MGliMml0MnlDQjhhSUFfeTFMV0Q4ZXJQaU80bndTcFFhNVBBRDByMjc0ckR2VXl0elhyWDFISl9CWGYwalZ6YnktUGJBajI2OVFRMVdJSUVPNThjUWNIY3Zwb3o5SjE2Uk9jMS1zME5uYUIwczVPR3BodzJNVWpMdHItQjJQcjROejZuZjQ2dngtQlJBcHU5QTEzMXZ1VkppU3hZNlpETXROLXJ0VkRwdk5qYlFjVGdEZTE2YnFwOVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家在发现可能导致帕金森病的被忽视因素后发出警告： “即使是低剂量暴露” -雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/scientists-issue-warning-discovering-overlooked-230000798.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-01145-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fresh research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fresh research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a link between nanoplastic ingestion and Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-01145-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, a recent experiment involved mice who were fed small amounts of polystyrene for three months. After that time, the mice had damaged intestinal lining and higher liver inflammation. That inflammation can lead to Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The nanoplastic exposure level used in this study (2 mg/kg every other day) reflects environmentally relevant doses, consistent with recent reports of nanoplastics found in human blood, lungs, placenta, and brain tissue," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-01145-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nanoplastics differ from microplastics by virtue of size. Microplastics typically measure between 1 micrometer and 5 millimeters, but nanoplastics are as small as 1 nanometer.

The change was posted Wednesday and first reported by&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/cdc-changes-webpage-to-say-vaccines-may-cause-autism-revising-prior-language-061e2dc2?mod=hp_lead_pos11" target="_blank"&gt; The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-194da8" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians and vaccine experts have long said that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;autism is among the most studied childhood conditions&lt;/a&gt; and that no credible research has ever suggested a link between it and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a474d" class="body-graf"&gt;The messaging is an about-face to the agency’s decades of research showing that any link between vaccines and autism has been scrutinized time and time again and thoroughly debunked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82096f" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists, vaccinologists and autism researchers who’ve sought to identify possible causes were gobsmacked by the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77f63d" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is madness,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, head of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious diseases committee, said during a media briefing Thursday. O’Leary said that scientists have taken an exhaustive look at potential environmental causes of autism. “One thing that is very clear is that vaccines are not one of those things. They do not cause autism. Period.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc0c14" class="body-graf"&gt;The Autism Science Foundation said in a statement that the group is “appalled” by the change in CDC messaging, calling it “anti-vaccine rhetoric and outright lies about vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90c295" class="body-graf"&gt;“The idea that vaccines cause autism is not only scientifically false,” ASF director Alison Singer said during a media briefing, “it’s also profoundly stigmatizing to autistic people and to their families. It frames autism as being caused by parental action, as if autism is a preventable injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5fd1bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the updated webpage also notes that the Department of Health and Human Services has launched “a comprehensive assessment” to examine the causes of autism. It’s unclear what the assessment will be or how it will be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5284d8" class="body-graf"&gt;HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said the website had been updated “to reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.” A question about how the agency defines such science wasn’t immediately answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02d0af" class="body-graf"&gt;The new language comes just ahead of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for Dec. 4-5, where members are expected to vote on changing the childhood schedule for hepatitis B vaccines. When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met in September, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;delayed changing the guidance &lt;/a&gt;that all newborns should be vaccinated against the incurable infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af0d74" class="body-graf"&gt;The Trump administration had previously demanded changes to the CDC website, notably insisting that anything related to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/federal-health-workers-terrified-dei-website-publishes-list-targets-rcna190711" target="_blank"&gt;diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, be erased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8239d8" class="body-graf"&gt;This latest revision “crossed the line,” said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University Medical Center and former chief scientist with the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab51ee" class="body-graf"&gt;The administration has “hijacked the premiere public health industry to pursue a narrow agenda of spreading inaccurate information about vaccines,” Goodman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87cdcc" class="body-graf"&gt;The new CDC messaging wasn’t reflected across the agency’s website, however. A&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; page for parents&lt;/a&gt; states that “scientific studies and reviews continue to show no relationship between vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-752739" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the revision was the clearest signal yet that the CDC may no longer be a source for objective scientific findings and advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e0e68" class="body-graf"&gt;“In my deepest heart, this is the day CDC died,” said a former CDC official who asked not to be named for safety reasons. “The public won’t care about nuance and individual websites now. Any messaging trying to distinguish some from all will sound tone deaf.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-037d62" class="body-graf"&gt;Changes on the CDC page seemed to contradict a commitment Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican, during Kennedy’s confirmation hearing earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccfe59" class="body-graf"&gt;During the hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-confirmation-hearings-rfk-jr-kash-patel-tulsi-gabbard-takeaways-rcna189463" target="_blank"&gt;Cassidy told Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, “My concern is that if there is any false note, any undermining of a mama’s trust in vaccines, another person will die from a vaccine-preventable disease.” After getting assurances from&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-sen-bill-cassidy-wavered-confirming-rfk-jr-says-lived-promises-vac-rcna206882" target="_blank"&gt; Kennedy not to undermine faith in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, Cassidy voted to confirm him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-10f8f6" class="body-graf"&gt;A key section on the page kept the heading, “Vaccines do not cause Autism,” but with an asterisk added. Following that is a newly added asterisk noting the heading is there “due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dd0cc" class="body-graf"&gt;One CDC staffer not permitted to speak to the media said they read the Cassidy reference as “a direct middle finger” to the senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-482081" class="body-graf"&gt;Cassidy didn’t respond to a request for comment. He later &lt;a href="https://x.com/senbillcassidy/status/1991599014270365829?s=46&amp;amp;t=mDcaBB75OPLoWR-8UuXfbA" target="_blank"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt; that “vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7af614" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has long been known as an anti-vaccine activist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-282a02" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the update to the CDC webpage is a nod to anti-vaccine activists that Kennedy hasn’t forgotten them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-308ce0" class="body-graf"&gt;“He’s signaling to his tribe that he’s there and he’s doing their bidding,” Adalja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-bb51b3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do the autism studies really show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-696a7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some scientists and doctors accused the CDC of cherry-picking studies that raise doubt about the relationship between autism and vaccines, and misrepresenting data or omitting credible studies that don’t show an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e204d0" class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re taking evidence of safety and pretending it shows uncertainty. And I think that’s in a lot of ways actually worse than citing bad studies, because it’s corrupting good ones,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious diseases specialist at Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43da5f" class="body-graf"&gt;For instance, the CDC webpage points to &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;a large Danish study&lt;/a&gt; from July, which found that aluminum exposure from vaccines during the first two years of life was not associated with increased rates of neurodevelopmental disorders. The study looked at more than 1.2 million children over roughly two decades and is considered one of the most robust pieces of evidence that vaccines and autism aren’t linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-392878" class="body-graf"&gt;“If aluminum in vaccines were causing autism or other chronic conditions, that study would have found it,” Scott said. “But ironically, they actually found slightly lower rates of autism with higher aluminum exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191a8f" class="body-graf"&gt;However, the CDC webpage highlights a supplementary figure in the study suggesting an increased risk of Asperger’s syndrome in a tiny subset of children. Scott described the result as a “statistical blip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d99c1" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you test 50 different conditions, you expect to see a couple of outliers just by pure chance. That’s just basic statistics,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-add670" class="body-graf"&gt;The webpage also cites two reports from the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academy of Medicine) — from 1991 and 2012 — suggesting there wasn’t enough data to say whether the pertussis vaccine causes autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a3111" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those reports actually rejected links between vaccines and autism,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-274bb0" class="body-graf"&gt;Other studies cited on the CDC webpage that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines aren’t well conducted, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ba449" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC references a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25189402/" target="_blank"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that aluminum in vaccines given to infants may be associated with a rise in autism cases. Scott said the study merely showed that two things happened at the same time — autism cases rose and the number of aluminum-containing vaccines given to children went up — not that they’re connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-782eec" class="body-graf"&gt;“The classic analogy is like saying ice cream sales cause drowning, because both increase in the summertime,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5a47b" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC webpage also points to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21058170/" target="_blank"&gt;2010 study&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested that boys vaccinated for hepatitis B as newborns had a threefold higher risk of autism compared with boys who were vaccinated later or never vaccinated. The study was based on parent surveys rather than medical records. Studies using medical records have found no link, Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bcf681" class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re not mentioning the dozens of other studies that have failed to show an association,” Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, said of the CDC’s updated webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cdfa18" class="body-graf"&gt;One study that’s “blatantly missing,” she said, is a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444" target="_blank"&gt;2015 analysis&lt;/a&gt; that considered the hereditary nature of autism. The researchers found that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was not associated with increased risk of autism, even among children with a higher risk of the disorder because their older siblings had it. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8607336/" target="_blank"&gt;massive review in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which evaluated 138 studies, also found that MMR vaccines don’t cause autism, but was not cited on the CDC webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec49a" class="body-graf"&gt;The bulk of research cements any doubt for ASF’s Alison Singer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af806f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“At some point you have to say that this question is asked and answered, just like we no longer study whether the Earth is flat or round,” she said. “Enough is enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPSlM1UzZXd0pVa0F1TEJlUmE5ZndObzM2Y2c5OGEyalVIaFdGUnlINEtuMjJfUlNDQzd6TzhoVE1oYUJUcHZ6WFBzNV9jT2FxY0RpeFBJT3Z5RXpLZ3YxaWFZWjY3S3RzZFJOUTRhZ2tjcEFfUG5haHhQb0U3V2dMVV9MUm9tc25wTWVXbW1jSUJzSFd3YzEyQm9neDhvTzkwLWhlTjU2Wl9rQdIBVkFVX3lxTFA2c01WbDdpa3lDT0VPNDVzZkUwaG00VGllcG1KOWdGZFdSRXZDSDQ1QnUtdmEtNW1mM042TUVOOUFVcDJPalNyVlJkeDBpQ2xzem9DQ1Zn</guid></item><item><title>早期研究发现，杀死血管中的“僵尸细胞”可能是治疗糖尿病的关键- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/slaying-zombie-cells-in-blood-vessels-could-be-key-to-treating-diabetes-early-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

In addition, the team exposed a different set of endothelial cells to radiation to induce senescence and then transplanted those cells into lean lab mice with normal metabolisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing senescent endothelial cells from the obese mice was associated with reduced fat mass, improved blood sugar levels and an overall reduction of metabolic dysfunction. Conversely, transplanting senescent cells into lean mice was associated with higher blood sugar levels and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When these cells go into this dormant state of senescence, they start producing inflammatory substances that are called Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)," Musi said. This mechanism helps explain why removing senescent cells was associated with an improved metabolic rate. Cells usually take nutrients from the bloodstream, such as fat and glucose, to create the energy they need to function properly. But when they encounter the onslaught of inflammatory molecules from SASP cells, that process gets derailed, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cellular metabolism gets altered, and that translates into abnormal tissue and then abnormal whole-body metabolism," Musi told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-d4a83e92-0cc2-414e-8d39-35260bbabfc5" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="senolytics-are-potential-treatments-3"&gt;'Senolytics' are potential treatments &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="d8797d97-c396-4816-ae00-7034c575ef6d"&gt;In a second phase of the study, the researchers treated both groups of mice with fisetin, a drug that the team previously found could eliminate senescent cells. This type of drug is known as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7405395/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7405395/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;senolytic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In both groups, treatment with fisetin was associated with fewer senescent blood-vessel cells and improved glucose tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested the drug on tissue samples from six adults with obesity who were in their 40s and 50s. They observed a similar decline in senescent blood vessel cells in the treated tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c2f61185-8e21-4bff-beff-68d0395c8028"&gt;Aguayo-Mazzucato thinks this study could pave the way for new treatments targeting senescent cells in the cardiovascular system. "Metabolic dysfunction is a whole-body problem. You have nutrient utilization alterations in a lot of tissues," she said. Because senescent vascular cells are present throughout the entire body, targeting them in different organs could help doctors address a range of diseases, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than say we're going to treat cancer or we're going to treat diabetes, Alzheimer's [or] Parkinson's as defined entities, the idea is saying they're all age-related and there are pathways that are common to all age-related diseases," Aguayo-Mazzucato said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/what-are-clinical-trials-and-studies" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clinical studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that investigate whether senescence has the same effects in human blood vessels that were observed in lab mice, Suda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="3798c96c-cc7b-4295-aea6-6225cf90dd27"&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Consuming ultra-processed foods can cause harm to major organs, in addition to a host of other health problems, a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday in the medical journal the Lancet revealed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.70086" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Another report&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday from researchers at Virginia Tech shows that young adults are more vulnerable to indulging in ultra-processed foods, according to Brenda Davy, a professor in the school’s Department of Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise, who helped conduct the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy told WTOP that people need to pay attention to what they’re buying to avoid ultra-processed food, which are dangerous to our health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An ultra-processed food is most easily recognized by having ingredients that would not be used in home cooking,” Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her study tested young adults who were put on diets with ultra-processed foods. After two weeks, the adults aged 18 to 21 ate more calories using a diet that was high in ultra-processed food even though they weren’t hungry. But this wasn’t true for adults in the 22-25 age group, Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results suggest that adolescents may be more vulnerable to ultra-processed foods, which can be addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of ultra-processed foods include “things like Sunny Delight, rather than 100% fresh orange juice,” she said. “A Pop-Tart, which would be an ultra-processed food, compared to a homemade banana nut muffin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re shopping at the grocery store, if you pick up an item and look at the ingredient list, if you see things like ‘fat, flour, oil, salt, sugar,’ those are things that are typically used in home cooking,” she said. “Those would not be considered ultra-processed ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, if you saw very long-sounding chemical names that you do not recognize, that’s one tip off of an item considered an ultra-processed food,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the research released this week shows that these ingredients could be more dangerous than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultra-processed foods are linked to increased risks of obesity and weight gain and a whole host of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases,” Davy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said in order to avoid ultra-processed foods, people should “prepare as many of their meals as possible at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That might help folks reduce their risk of some of these chronic diseases related to their diet,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Davy said that there are some advantages to food processing by manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest advantages for using processed foods is that they do have a longer shelf life,” she said. “That is an important benefit of ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said that one of the big drawbacks is how addictive they can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They may drive us to overeat them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

"Now that we have more prevention options for RSV, the overall respiratory virus pattern may have shifted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still recommended that people get vaccinated, Glanville emphasized, but protection will be "partial at best and worse than normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Now that we have more prevention options for RSV, the overall respiratory virus pattern may have shifted."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu immunity may also be weaker this year. As Jhaveri pointed out, immunity "increases after vaccination and natural infection" but wanes over time, especially in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, based on Australia’s data, "we think the vaccine should offer the usual levels of protection," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk individuals — including those with chronic conditions, weakened immune systems or obesity, as well as pregnant women and young children — should take extra caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About half the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:children who die from flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;children who die from flu&lt;/a&gt; and flu-related complications have no prior risk factor," Jhaveri noted, emphasizing that vaccination remains "the first step in preventing flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those hesitant to visit a clinic, a nasal spray vaccine was recently approved for either self-administration or for parents and caregivers, allowing families to vaccinate at home, Jhaveri noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glanville's company, Centivax, is "developing a universal flu vaccine, entering human trials in early 2026," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/doctors-reveal-troubling-signs-early-flu-trends-warn-unusually-bad-season" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors reveal troubling signs in early flu trends, warn of ‘unusually bad’ season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Doctors reveal troubling signs in early flu trends, warn of ‘unusually bad’ season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNV0NpcEFhOVVKN3R6V25iUmViSzdGcl83RzRrcnlrOEFMWVkwUVZTSGxrZXVEQVJzMmItbThtd1JkNnlteDI5WHNlZElMcXNIVGE3YTN2WDM0TnFlRG9kX2VCNWhnNGNtZklwcXFnbnI0Sno5MmVza2lBSndqZ0JfZktjVm03ZE0</guid></item><item><title>在经历了前所未有的自闭症疫苗信息传递变化后，科学家、倡导者表示， CDC不再值得信赖- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/after-unprecedented-autism-vaccine-messaging-change-scientists-advocates-say-cdc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 80 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was respected around the world for its authoritative, evidence-based leadership in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the CDC’s stunning reversal Wednesday—stating on its website that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism”—shows the agency can no longer be trusted, multiple doctors and public health advocates told CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until late yesterday, the CDC webpage accurately stated, “Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the CDC website echoes the views of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has claimed without evidence that vaccines cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html"&gt;website now states,&lt;/a&gt; “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A 'tragic day' for public health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a global leader in science, the CDC has devolved into “a propaganda machine for RFK Jr.'s fixed, immutable, science-resistant theories,” said Paul Offit, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. “The CDC is being weaponized to promote RFK Jr.’s anti-vaccine point of view. So why should you trust it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many public health experts who spoke to CIDRAP News sounded sorrowful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today is a tragic day for public health, for the US government,” said Michael T. Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (publisher of CIDRAP News). “Ideology has replaced science as the means for addressing life-saving research and best practices that save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many physicians worry that the CDC’s new message will dissuade parents from vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This will cause real harm,” said Jake Scott, MD, an infectious disease expert and clinical associate professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents searching for trustworthy information will find official CDC language that appears to validate concerns that have been thoroughly debunked. Some will delay or skip vaccines. We know what happens next—preventable diseases return to communities with low vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also removed scientific reviews of vaccines from its website. The website now rehashes conspiracy theories claiming that government scientists and the medical community have hidden the truth about vaccines, claiming, that “studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know what happens next—preventable diseases return to communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacking scientists as dishonest and corrupt comes straight out of the anti-vaccine playbook, said Peter Hotez, MD, codirector of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, who also helped develop an affordable, unpatented COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how the wellness influencer industry works,” Hotez said. “It’s not enough to push the snake oil. You have to discredit mainstream biomedical science and portray scientists as public enemies or cartoon villains, and that's what Kennedy’s seeking to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/public-health-officials-face-grim-new-reality-after-cdc-shooting"&gt;became the target of violence&lt;/a&gt; in August after a gunman who blamed COVID-19 shots for his depression &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/in-cdc-attack-man-fired-180-shots-breaking-150-windows"&gt;fired 180 shots into the agency’s&lt;/a&gt; Atlanta headquarters, killing a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent researchers from seven countries have conducted 40 high-quality studies involving 5.6 million people looking at the relationship between vaccines and autism since 1998. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There’s no link between vaccines and autism,” said Susan J. Kressly, MD, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents,” Kressley said. “We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy promised Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD, a Republican from Louisiana, that he would not remove statements on the CDC website that said vaccines do not cause autism. Cassidy's approval was critical in confirming Kennedy as HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy didn’t respond to an interview request. But he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of vaccines on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,” Cassidy wrote. “What parents need to know right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s rejection of vaccine science undercuts the credibility of all federal government science, said Ari Ne’eman, PhD, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives people justifiable cause to be suspicious about anything that comes out from this administration regarding the science of autism,” Ne’eman said. “This reinforces this sense that RFK Jr.’s political judgments are being used in place of the scientific process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debra Houry, MD, the CDC’s former chief medical officer, said the agency’s scientists had nothing to do with the website change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists were not involved in any of these decisions, and when you remove science from scientific information you get ideology,” said Houry, who resigned from the CDC in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“T&lt;span&gt;his is what we have been warning Congress about—and yesterday on a webinar for health journalists I said I would not trust information on autism from CDC&lt;/span&gt;,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, allies of Kennedy are cheering the changes. "This is the biggest health reversal of our lifetime," Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/childrenshd/status/1991515222775906323?s=43&amp;amp;t=0dtS1Ti4eIH_z6yy-SmqoQ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said on X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Autism community speaks out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autism community, which has long pushed back against the idea that vaccines cause autism, also criticized the changes to the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism,” said Alison Singer, MBA, president of the Autism Science Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The facts don’t change because the administration does,” Singer said. “At this point it’s not about doing more studies; it’s about being willing to accept what the existing study data clearly show. You can’t just ignore data because it doesn’t confirm your beliefs, but that’s what the administration is doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic people have been sharply critical of Kennedy for his demeaning characterizations of people with the condition and description of the neurodevelopmental condition as a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t just ignore data because it doesn’t confirm your beliefs, but that’s what the administration is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t clear what further amount or type of proof or research would be enough to satisfy Kennedy or the CDC that autism isn’t caused by vaccines,” said Sam Brandsen, PhD, who has autism and is a part-time postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada. Brandsen’s son also has autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if vaccines were the cause of autism—which I don't believe—I would much rather have my child be his wonderful autistic self and have vaccine protection against deadly diseases than try to withhold necessary vaccines out of a fear of autistic traits,” Brandsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

From childhood hospital beds to her early twenties spent tethered to IV lines and feeding pumps, her life has been shaped by relentless pain, chronic illness and the slow disintegration of her organs. Now, after years of fighting a disease that has stolen every part of her youth, Annaliese has chosen to end her life through voluntary assisted dying. As she explained in an interview with News.com.au, the decision came after a lifetime of worsening symptoms and unrelenting decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Adelaide, Annaliese endured years of unexplained agony. Doctors struggled to understand why she vomited constantly, why her stomach failed to empty, and why even the simplest bodily functions became impossible. It was only when she turned 18 and moved into adult care that she finally received a name for her suffering: autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG), a rare disorder in which the immune system attacks the nerves controlling involuntary functions such as digestion, heart rate and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A life defined by pain, fractures and failing organs from birth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AAG progressed, Annaliese’s digestive system essentially stopped working. Her bowel behaved as though blocked, despite nothing physically obstructing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeding tubes were inserted, but she continued vomiting. Eventually she was placed on total parenteral nutrition, dependent on an IV line for all nutrients. This brought its own dangers. Any infection entering the line could spread to her bloodstream within hours. She survived sepsis 25 times, each episode a fight for her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to People magazine, the medications required to manage her symptoms came with devastating consequences. Annaliese developed severe osteoporosis in her early twenties, suffering four spinal fractures, a cracked sternum and dangerously high pressure on her heart and lungs. Her body became fragile and unpredictable, a daily battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are beautiful moments,” she said, “but they are exhausting. I am in chronic, debilitating pain every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watching life move without her&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her friends moved into adulthood, with engagements, weddings and new babies, Annaliese remained confined to hospital rooms and her bed at home. Birthdays passed unnoticed behind curtains and machines. She described the feeling as being stuck in place, watching everyone else race ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No man wants to date someone dying,” she admitted quietly. “I understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the age of 22, doctors told her what she had feared: her condition was terminal. Multi-organ failure had begun. Her body could no longer tolerate regular feeding. Sepsis lurked behind every medical procedure. The future held only pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of fighting, Annaliese realised she wanted to reclaim the one thing her disease had not yet taken: her autonomy. She applied for voluntary assisted dying (VAD), a process that required extensive medical assessments and psychological evaluations before approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A choice made with clarity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the approval finally came, after three weeks of scrutiny, Annaliese cried with relief. “It sounds strange to be happy about it,” she said, “but I finally felt a little bit of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasised that choosing VAD was not surrender. “It is not giving up. It is knowing you have fought for so long and so hard, and you cannot keep suffering like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her decision devastated her family. Her mother, Amanda, still prays for a miracle, even as she understands the unbearable reality her daughter faces. Her father, Patrick, initially begged her to keep fighting until he watched doctors resuscitate her yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remembers turning to him and pleading: “Dad, please let me go. I will not hate you. I just cannot do this anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That moment changed everything. “I totally understand,” he finally told her. “You have had enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing dignity at the end of a long fight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Annaliese, the decision is not about death, but about relief from pain, from fear and from the dread of waking each day in a failing body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel lucky to have this choice,” she said. “It is one of the bravest things you can do, to say you have had enough. I have fought bloody hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In choosing her own ending, she is taking back the small piece of life her disease never controlled: her final say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingJBVV95cUxPS0lpRjg0QjNVU3J0SE1OVmFtblhiRFJ6djdlR01jenlUWWU5S2s4c3FwWDdQUUItcVhOZnRFdEVvMEw0aTJ6UFVOR0o2eHZhbWF3YkFNaGxRd3AtNnctTjNmZWdwNk5LOElIQ2JGclk4VUJWMk5kQmZIZjBrX1JvU20xa1YyLTlvY1JraXN6QVNEa0NsdFBsMk9oT3MyT0JCNnpWRDE4Rzc1dzFtVGhYTzRpVGNNOGlaMEl1dGhUM1FCa25BNkZzUEFCTjFMc1Y4bWNuU0wxaFpJZUtoOHE5UjNpVFQ2V0Q5LVNyWHEydzZPbjBXeUc4THpWUDMxT1VXLV9tTmFpX2ZpS3YzRVhNSVZ6RHZyaERPV2pUQjRR</guid></item><item><title>自身免疫性疾病可以袭击身体的任何部位，主要影响女性。以下是须知事项- VINnews</title><link>https://vinnews.com/2025/11/20/autoimmune-diseases-can-strike-any-part-of-the-body-and-mostly-affect-women-heres-what-to-know/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content tagdiv-type"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body — even the brain — and tens of millions of people. While most common in women, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they’re on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an out-of-whack immune system. Furthest along is a cancer treatment called CAR-T therapy that’s had some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. It wipes out immune system B cells — both rogue and normal ones — and the theory is those that grow back are healthier. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are autoimmune diseases?&lt;br&gt;
They’re chronic diseases that can range from mild to life-threatening, more than 100 with different names depending on how and where they do damage. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sjögren’s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can even hijack the organ that makes us “us” — the brain, with what’s called autoimmune encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a “flare” for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why autoimmune diseases are so difficult to diagnose&lt;br&gt;
Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms — rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren’s also can harm major organs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are efforts to improve. The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. And scientists are discovering a growing list of rogue antibodies responsible for the memory loss, seizures, even psychosis that can signal autoimmune encephalitis. That’s helping doctors better identify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the immune system gets out of whack&lt;br&gt;
The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you,” what scientists call tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can’t calm things down after a battle. If the system can’t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune diseases are often set off by a trigger&lt;br&gt;
Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren’t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some “environmental” trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury — but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research links a virus to lupus&lt;br&gt;
Among infectious triggers, scientists already know the Epstein-Barr virus can set some people on the path to multiple sclerosis — and new evidence links it to lupus, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about everybody gets that virus by young adulthood and after the initial infection, it still hides out, inactive, in the body. Stanford University researchers found a hiding place is in a tiny proportion of the immune system’s B cells. They found that occasionally, in some people, the virus nudges certain B cells into an inflammatory state that can spur an autoimmune chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research doesn’t explain why 95% adults have been infected with Epstein-Barr yet only a small fraction of the population gets lupus. But it’s a new clue into how infections can have a lasting impact on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women are at highest risk for autoimmune diseases&lt;br&gt;
Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women’s vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn’t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment for autoimmune diseases is complicated&lt;br&gt;
According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That’s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding how these foods work helps create everyday meals that support calmer and more predictable metabolic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 everyday carbs that help maintain stable glucose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her reel, Holistic Health Nutritionist Khushi Chhabra explained that individuals with prediabetes or diabetes may experience a significant reduction in glucose spikes when they shift from refined carbohydrates to more nutrient dense alternatives. She said that “changing just your carbs can drop your sugar spikes by 30 to 50 percent,” emphasising the value of foods that digest more slowly and support more stable energy patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her guidance highlights five everyday carbohydrate swaps that, when used regularly, may contribute to steadier glucose release, improved satiety and more balanced insulin responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Causes and prevention of prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recommended options include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="626871" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="jowar" source="Orion"&gt;Jowar&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="573117" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="quinoa" source="Orion"&gt;Quinoa&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="110678" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="oats" source="Orion"&gt;Oats&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="626872" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="ragi" source="Orion"&gt;Ragi&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;keyword id="1476505" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sweet-potato" source="Orion"&gt;Sweet potato&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Jowar &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khushi Chhabra highlighted jowar as a smart swap for white rice or wheat because it contains resistant starch that digests slowly and delays the rise of glucose after meals. This makes jowar especially useful for people who experience sharp post meal sugar increases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/8/2205" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined resistant starch intake and found meaningful reductions in postprandial glucose responses, showing how grains like jowar can influence metabolic behaviour. Its natural polyphenols have also been linked with improved insulin function, adding another layer of support for healthier glucose patterns throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slower glucose entry due to resistant starch that stays intact during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Better insulin activity supported by natural polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Longer lasting fullness because of its high fibre content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Quinoa&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa was celebrated in the reel for its complete protein profile and mineral density, both of which influence glucose regulation. Its balanced amino acid structure slows digestion and helps prevent steep glucose rises after meals. Its magnesium content may also support insulin signalling, making quinoa a helpful choice for individuals aiming for smoother glucose responses. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11273950/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study in Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined quinoa based meals and reported more stable postprandial glucose levels compared with refined grain meals. These research findings reinforce quinoa’s role as a nutrient rich carbohydrate option with significant metabolic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary advantages include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slower carbohydrate breakdown thanks to its complete protein composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Support for insulin responsiveness through its magnesium content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Added satiety from its blend of protein, fibre and essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Oats &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats were recommended in the reel for their ability to support more stable glucose outcomes due to beta glucan, a soluble fibre that forms a gel in the stomach. This gel slows the movement of food through the digestive tract and moderates the speed at which glucose enters the bloodstream. Beta glucan has been widely studied for its effects on blood sugar. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-021-00875-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that daily oat beta glucan intake led to lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels, highlighting its value for metabolic regulation. Fermentation of this fibre in the gut also produces short chain fatty acids that may support insulin sensitivity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notable metabolic benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Smoother glucose responses due to slower intestinal transit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• SCFA production through fibre fermentation, which may aid long term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Better fullness and appetite control supported by soluble fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Ragi &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ragi was emphasised in the reel for having a naturally lower glycaemic load than wheat based staples. Its high fibre content, mineral profile and amino acid composition contribute to slower digestion and gentler glucose responses. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7270244/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared finger millet meals with refined wheat alternatives and found significantly lower postprandial glucose levels in the ragi group. This suggests that ragi can be helpful for individuals who experience frequent cravings or energy dips linked to unstable glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Slower glucose release supported by its fibre density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Lower glycaemic load that produces gentler post meal patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Reduced cravings helped by its amino acids and nutrient rich composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Sweet potato&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khushi Chhabra described sweet potato as a more balanced option compared with regular potatoes or white rice because its starches break down more gradually. Its antioxidant profile, which includes beta carotene and anthocyanins, has been studied for potential benefits on metabolic inflammation and insulin behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221242922200668X" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research published in Food Bioscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined sweet potato extracts and found improved insulin sensitivity and moderated glucose responses among participants. This combination of steady digestion and antioxidant activity makes sweet potato a helpful carbohydrate for individuals looking for consistent, sustained energy and more predictable glucose curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important advantages include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Gradual carbohydrate digestion that reduces fast glucose rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Antioxidants that may support healthier insulin activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Smoother energy release due to its balanced fibre and starch content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's website now says a link between vaccines and autism &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cannot be ruled out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That's a reversal from the CDC's longstanding stance that there is no link.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The change comes even though a connection between vaccines and autism has long been debunked by a large body of high-quality research. But Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5285571/the-history-behind-an-enduring-public-health-falsehood-that-vaccines-cause-autism" target="_blank"&gt;long promoted the discredited claim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's change is alarming public health experts. They are already worried about a drop in childhood vaccination, which has led to a resurgence of dangerous childhood diseases like measles and whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has been changed to promote false information suggesting vaccines cause autism," said Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a statement. "Since 1998, independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people. The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There's no link between vaccines and autism."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She went on to say, "Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents. We call on the CDC to stop wasting government resources to amplify false claims that sow doubt in one of the best tools we have to keep children healthy and thriving: routine immunizations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon repeated one of the changes to the website: "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said the department "has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The new statement shows a lack of understanding of the term 'evidence,'" the &lt;a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement the organization provided to NPR, adding, "No environmental factor has been better studied as a potential cause of autism than vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's a statement that's confusing by design, said &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Offitt&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "These are the usual anti-vaccine tropes, misrepresentation of studies, false equivalence," he says. "They might as well say chicken nuggets might cause autism because you can't prove that either."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The changes on the website "blindsided" career scientists at CDC, says Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former top CDC official who resigned from the agency in August. "The scientists did not participate in its creation," he says. "And the data are unvetted."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two current CDC staffers, who contacted NPR Thursday, say the updates are a glaring red flag that indicate the vaccine information on the agency website is no longer credible, and is instead "anti-science." They requested anonymity out of concern they could lose their jobs for speaking to the press.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The moves are the latest in a series of steps Kennedy has taken on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines that run counter to mainstream medical and scientific organizations like the pediatrics academy, the Infectious Disease Society of American and the American College of Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine proponents say the moves are recklessly undermining public confidence in vaccines and fueling vaccine hesitancy, putting the nation's children at risk. The U.S. appears to be poised to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5604686/canada-loses-measles-free-status-raising-alarms-among-experts" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lose its status as having eliminated measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy sacked all the members of the CDC's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, earlier this year and replaced the members with his own slate. In one of its first actions, the new advisory committee called for the removal of the preservative thimerosal used in a small fraction of flu vaccines, even though safety concerns about it have also been debunked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under Kennedy, federal health agencies have also made it harder for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and canceled grants funding new vaccines that rely on mRNA technology at the heart of the most used COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has also claimed there is a link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism, and promoted the use of leucovorin, a prescription form of vitamin B9, to treat autism &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552751/autism-leucovorin-folinic-acid-folate-vitamin-reality-check" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;even though the evidence supporting that is scant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An ACIP working group is now studying more major changes in childhood vaccinations, including removing compounds that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/31/g-s1-95419/aluminum-salts-vaccines-safety-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include aluminum used to increase vaccine effectiveness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These adjuvants have been used safely for nearly a century. The committee is also exploring &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/07/nx-s1-5576321/childhood-vaccine-schedule-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;separating a single shot now given to protect against measles, mumps and rubella in a single shot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into individual shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts say both moves are scientifically unsound and would essentially upend the nation's childhood vaccination regimen, leaving children vulnerable to diseases that had long been brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee is also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542405/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-advisory-panel-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-shot-in-infants" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;considering recommending delaying vaccinating children against hepatitis B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For years, all babies have been vaccinated against hepatitis at birth. Hepatitis B can cause liver failure and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC acknowledges in a footnote on its main webpage on autism and vaccines that it still carries a header reading "Vaccines do not cause autism*" and says it hasn't "been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR emailed Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy's office for comment but didn't receive an immediate response. Cassidy chairs the Senate HELP Committee, which vetted Kennedy's nomination to lead HHS and voted along party lines to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CDC webpage that previously said there’s no link between autism and vaccines was quietly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; to call that claim “not evidence based,” among other statements that are not factual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The updated page did not go through normal scientific clearance, Daniel Jernigan, a top CDC leader who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;resigned in August&lt;/a&gt;, told STAT, citing conversations with CDC staff. Another person familiar with the situation, not authorized to speak publicly, also said that the CDC office that manages the page was not involved in the decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The former head of the CDC center that oversees immunization policy and implementation concurred. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​From my personal communications with folks, everyone was blindsided from the perspective of career scientists,” said Demetre Daskalakis, who was director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases until he quit in August at the same time as Jernigan.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The changes are the latest move by the federal health department, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/18/rfk-jr-profile-hhs-secretary-delivers-on-trump-maha-priorities/"&gt;led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, to sow doubt about childhood vaccines. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, has for years &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-confirmation-hearing/"&gt;pushed the discredited idea&lt;/a&gt; that there is a link between vaccines and a rise in autism cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“All I can say is ‘Wake up, America. This administration wants to take your vaccines away from you. And they’re on a path to do that,’” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, home of the Vaccine Integrity Project, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told STAT that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism “have been ignored by health authorities,” echoing a claim on the CDC page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HHS has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links,” HHS said in a statement. According to HHS, federal lawmakers were informed in advance of the change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;Multitudes of studies have been conducted over decades&lt;/a&gt; to look for a link between autism and various vaccines or components of vaccines, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/19/rfk-jr-warning-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-raises-concern/"&gt;preservative thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/14/aluminum-in-vaccines-large-danish-study-finds-no-link-to-autism-asthma-allergies/"&gt;adjuvant aluminum&lt;/a&gt;. They have failed to find compelling evidence of a link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The conclusion is clear and unambiguous: There’s no link between vaccines and autism,” Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement. “Anyone repeating this harmful myth is misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead parents.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kressly said that more than 40 studies involving 5.6 million people have been conducted to disprove any link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The changes to the CDC website appear to violate at least the spirit of a promise Kennedy made during his confirmation hearing to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), whose vote sealed Kennedy’s approval, that “CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the website maintains a header reading “Vaccines do not cause autism*”, though the text of the page has been entirely altered to dispute that claim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the very bottom of the page is an explanation for the asterisk: It says the subhead could not be removed due to the agreement with Cassidy. The senator has not responded to STAT’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday afternoon, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cassidy-says-vaccines-are-safe-after-cdc-webpage-update/"&gt;Cassidy weighed in&lt;/a&gt;, without mentioning the CDC or Kennedy by name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism,” he said. “Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that Kennedy has reneged on assurances he gave Cassidy to secure the senator’s support for his confirmation, but it is perhaps the most brazen. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;dismissed a panel of federal vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/kennedy-names-new-acip-members-cdc-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;handpicked replacements&lt;/a&gt;, including several with anti-vaccine views. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Cassidy said Kennedy had promised to maintain the recommendations of that panel, known as ACIP, without changes, but &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/17/monarez-senate-testimony-reveals-cdc-in-crisis/"&gt;former CDC Director Susan Monarez told Congress&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy had pressured her to accept their recommendations before reviewing their evidence. The CDC is currently led by acting Director Jim O’Neill, who is also deputy secretary of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a physician, expressed concerns about Kennedy’s views on vaccines, but ultimately voted to confirm him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group once led by Kennedy, celebrated the change Thursday morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Finally, the CDC is beginning to acknowledge the truth about this condition that affects millions, disavowing the bold, long-running lie that ‘vaccines do not cause autism,’” Mary Holland, president and CEO of the group, said in a statement. “No studies have ever proved this irresponsible claim; on the contrary, many studies point to vaccines as the plausible primary cause of autism.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instructions to change the website came from HHS, Jernigan said. The CDC scientific staff who were notified of the pending change protested that the information should not be posted, but they were overruled, he added, saying that many of the scientific leaders who remain at the CDC were unaware that the website was about to be changed. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Some CDC staffers spent Thursday morning trying to learn more about how the changes were made and who was behind them, according to one person familiar with the efforts. Daskalakis said he’d heard some were in tears when they discovered the altered webpage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts warned that the CDC is no longer a trustworthy source of vaccine information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It comes not as a shock but it’s hard to believe that on the CDC website we have disinformation,” said Kathryn Edwards, a Vanderbilt professor emerita of pediatrics who is part of the university’s vaccine research program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daskalakis said the page will advance Kennedy’s efforts to undermine confidence in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’ve weaponized CDC to be able to achieve their ends,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC webpage states that the changes were made in compliance with the Data Quality Act, which mandates that federal agencies ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information they share with the public.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism,” the website says. “However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm sees the change as part of a plan to get autism into the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which he said would bankrupt the program and force manufacturers of childhood vaccines out of the U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s almost unimaginable to think that we may one day have a country where there are no vaccines available because the companies won’t make it due to liability,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Elio McCabe, policy director at the Autistic Women &amp;amp; Nonbinary Network, the website changes are a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/22/autism-community-fears-rfk-jr-hhs-vaccine-misinformation-research-funding/"&gt;grim reminder&lt;/a&gt; of the community’s long struggle against misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the autism community, we have already spent years battling the idea that vaccines have a causal link to autism,” he said. “It is dystopian to see such wrong and hurtful rhetoric attributed to what was once one of our most trustworthy federal agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;O. Rose Broderick contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has released the full data from its phase 3 trial of an mRNA flu vaccine candidate, with the potential new shot demonstrating 34.5% greater efficacy compared to a control vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of 9,225 people received given Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine, 57 developed the flu, compared to 87 of the 9,251 people given Sanofi’s Fluzone shot. Pfizer &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416779"&gt;published the results&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine on Nov. 19.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer’s mRNA candidate “met the criteria for both noninferiority and superiority” against A strains of influenza, but not B strains, the authors wrote. Most of the flu cases seen in the trial were caused by A strains, which are generally &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/flu-a-vs-flu-b"&gt;more common and more severe&lt;/a&gt; than influenza B.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer originally announced its success against influenza A in the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05540522"&gt;phase 3 study&lt;/a&gt; in October 2023. Moderna, too, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/moderna-checks-few-boxes-phase-3-flu-shot-trial-misses-b-strains-and-safety"&gt;had previously missed&lt;/a&gt; against influenza B with its mRNA vaccine candidate, and a combo COVID-flu shot from Pfizer and BioNTech &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/pfizer-biontechs-combo-mrna-shot-latest-be-defeated-influenza-strain-b"&gt;also struggled&lt;/a&gt; against the B strain in phase 3.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moderna then altered its vaccine’s formula and, in June, finally announced it had &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/modernas-mrna-flu-vaccine-beats-approved-competitor-latest-phase-3-win"&gt;conquered&lt;/a&gt; influenza B. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  


&lt;p&gt;Pfizer’s modRNA shot led to similar side effects as the Sanofi control vaccine, the authors wrote in the paper, but at a higher rate. The mRNA candidate caused 70.1% of people to have an immune reaction at the injection site, compared to 43.1% for the control, as well as whole-body reactions like fatigue and headache in 65.8% of participants compared to 48.7% in the control arm. Fever developed in 5.6% of those given the modRNA shot, compared to 1.7% of those given the control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One patient given modRNA developed a grade 3 reaction at the injection site and grade 4 anaphylaxis, which was determined to be related to the vaccine. There were no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis, the heart-swelling side effect that has been &lt;a href="https://publichealthcollaborative.org/alerts/anti-vaccine-study-resurfaces-misleading-myocarditis-claims/"&gt;used by opponents of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to disparage mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Frequencies of severe and life-threatening adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial were low and similar in the two trial groups,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than using a weakened form of the flu virus or proteins from the virus, mRNA vaccines instead provide the human body with instructions to make viral proteins itself. Once the body uses the mRNA to make flu proteins, the immune system can recognize those proteins and build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since first being developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9917162/"&gt;proven&lt;/a&gt; to be safe, effective and cost-effective alternatives to traditional vaccines. There are currently no approved mRNA shots for flu.

Although diet quality remains important, emerging research suggests that meal timing, especially when it comes to dinner, may play an equally significant role in supporting metabolic health during the colder months. The body’s internal circadian rhythm is closely linked to natural light cycles, and early sunsets in winter trigger biological changes that prepare the body for rest much sooner. This affects digestion, hormone activity, blood sugar regulation, and fat burning. Eating too late in the evening can disrupt these processes, leading to sluggish digestion, sleep disturbances, and metabolic strain. Scientists now suggest that adjusting dinner timing could be a simple, effective way to improve overall well-being throughout winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="30835782" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="winter-meal-timing" source="keywords"&gt;winter meal timing&lt;/keyword&gt; matters for metabolic health and blood sugar control&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/106/2/e1050/5952711?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that eating earlier in the day supports better metabolism, blood sugar control, and circadian alignment. The study shows that earlier meal timing aligns with the body’s circadian rhythm, improving blood sugar regulation, digestion, and metabolic efficiency, while late meals disrupt hormonal balance and increase metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Foods that boost immunity before winter sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recurring finding is that eating dinner very late, such as around 9:30 or 10 pm, can lead to significantly higher blood sugar spikes compared with eating the same meal earlier, around 6 pm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when calorie intake and bedtime remain identical, the body processes food less efficiently at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night meals tend to impair fat burning, slow digestion, and reduce insulin sensitivity. This increases the likelihood of elevated blood glucose levels and may, over time, contribute to weight gain or metabolic issues. Larger scientific reviews further show that people who consume most of their daily calories earlier have better outcomes in terms of body weight, blood pressure, cholesterol balance, and overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During winter, shorter daylight hours can confuse circadian rhythms and disrupt the hormones that stabilise mood and appetite. Reduced sunlight exposure may also trigger low mood or seasonal affective tendencies, which often lead people to snack more or delay dinner. However, eating too late in the evening can worsen sleep quality and strain digestion, especially when the body is winding down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How eating earlier supports digestion, hormones, mood, and sleep in winter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you finish your evening meal earlier, you allow your body to digest food efficiently while metabolism is still relatively active. Digestion, gut motility, and calorie burning tend to function best earlier in the day when the body is aligned with natural light exposure. As bedtime approaches, these processes slow dramatically, making late meals more taxing and uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating earlier supports the healthy release of hormones such as melatonin, insulin, and cortisol, all of which influence sleep patterns, hunger cues, and energy regulation. Melatonin, for example, begins rising shortly after sunset in winter. If you eat too close to bedtime, your body receives competing signals: one telling it to rest and repair, another urging it to digest a large meal. This conflict can lead to restless sleep, increased heartburn, or frequent night-time awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aligning dinnertime with the body’s natural rhythm can also lift mood during winter. Consistent meal timing stabilises blood sugar, preventing the sharp highs and lows that contribute to irritability or energy crashes. Early meals also reduce the temptation to snack late at night, a habit strongly linked with weight gain, indigestion, and disturbed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ideal winter dinner timings and practical ways to adjust your evening routine&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts generally recommend finishing dinner between 5:30 pm and 7:00 pm during winter. This gives the body enough time, about two to three hours, to digest food comfortably before sleep. If your schedule varies, aim for a consistent eating window that aligns with your daily routine and activity level. People who exercise intensely in the evening may need slightly later meals, but for most individuals, an earlier dinner is the healthier choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A practical way to support earlier dinners is to shift more of your calories toward breakfast and lunch, when metabolism is naturally higher. Eating a substantial morning meal provides steady energy and reduces evening hunger, making earlier dining easier to sustain. Keeping evening meals lighter and simpler, such as soups, lentils, lean proteins, and vegetables, also helps digestion during the colder months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a stable routine, maximising natural light exposure during the day, and reducing blue light in the evening can further support circadian balance. Together, these habits help regulate appetite, promote restful sleep, and keep metabolism functioning smoothly throughout winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old from Adelaide, South &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/australia/"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, has depended on an IV feeding tube for the past decade but has now decided to end her life with aid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Australia patients applying for assisted dying must be a permanent resident and have a condition expected to cause death within 12 months for neurodegenerative conditions, and 6 months for others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be approved patients must go through multiple safeguards, including assessments from two doctors to confirm legibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once a person is deemed mentally competent they are given the option to either self-administer or have a doctor deliever the lethal substance.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		


&lt;p&gt;While assisted dying is currently illegal in the UK, a bill proposed last year  seeks to allow terminally ill adults to request and receive assistance to end their own lives under strict safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until Annaliese turned 18 and transitioned from a paediatric facility to an adult one was she then finally diagnosed with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The neurological disease is rare; it damages the nerve that controls the heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and urination.&lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;She said: “My bowel acts as if it’s blocked but there’s nothing actually blocking it. It’s just the nerves don’t work so, as gross as this is, my stools would back up so much that I would throw it up or drain out my tummy.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“I had feeding tubes placed in me and I was still vomiting and then we discovered that my stomach wasn’t emptying so I was put on TPN (IV feeding).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aged 22, Annaliese was told her condition was terminal – which led her to decide to “die on her own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She now has multi-organ failure and has survived &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/sepsis/"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; 25 times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Australian was put on strong medications to help subside her symptoms but it caused her to develop serve osteoporosis – a condition causing bones to become weak and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese previously fractured her spine in four places, cracked her sternum in half and nearly crushed her heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: “I was so miserable, you can’t change it so you have to just deal with it really. Even though there’s beautiful moments in my days, they are exhausting and long. I’m in chronic debilitating pain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The young woman missed out on her 18th and 21st birthdays, spending them both bed-bound in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_15522128" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Annaliese said she felt stuck as she watched her friends get married and start their own families&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15522138" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Australian battled sepsis 25 times and suffered many broken bones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Annaliese added: “All my friends, they’re having &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/babies/"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt;, getting engaged, married. Everyone’s life is moving and I’m just stuck. I’m not living. I’m surviving every day, which is tough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She now no longer wants to endure the pain and the disease which has left her feeling like she is, “walking on a field of landmines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After seeing herself in the mirror one day while hospitalised, it solidified her decision to “die on her own terms” with medical aid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese said: “It wasn’t me and I was so exhausted,” she said. “Life for me now is getting up each day doing what I need to do medically, taking the painkillers, trying to get through the day, just to go to bed and do it all again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her parents and sister are heartbroken at the idea with her mother, Amanda, always hoping for a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Amanda knows what challenges her daughter faces, her father Patrick has watched Annaliese overcome every setback and believed she could get past the illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every time she goes to the hospital, she fights for her own life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The amount of times Annie has been in hospital and on her deathbed… to have to sit there and watch her go through it … but she is amazing,” said Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Annaliese revealed she told her father in the kitchen one day: “Dad I’ve had enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The moment her father came to terms with her decision was when he watched as she was resuscitated by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She remembered saying: “Dad, please let me go. I will not hate you if you let me go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If this happens again, I don’t want anything. And please know that in my heart, you letting me go and saying no to treatment…I’m happy with and that’s what I want.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She confessed to thinking it was weird to be happy: “It’s hard for me because I am in pain and then I am at peace, but then I put the pain onto my &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/family/"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have this battle in your head of not wanting to hurt them, so I will put some thought into how it will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a relief for Annaliese; explaining that she won’t have to wake up everyday with anxiety about the pain-filled day ahead or feel the pain of starving to death when they can’t feed me anymore, or the horror of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		


&lt;p&gt;Following the three week evaluation process Annaliese was approved for Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: “I feel so lucky that I do have this choice. It’s one of the bravest things you could ever do, to say I want VAD. It’s not giving up. You’ve had enough and you fought bloody hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

						EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.					&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society – from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it’s rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/youre-not-alone/"&gt;The Sun launched the You’re Not Alone campaign.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others… &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7194521/the-sun-suicide-prevention-campaign-launch/"&gt;You’re Not Alone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As we age, our metabolism slows down, so the usual exercises will not give us the same benefits as it did in the 30s, or 20s. So, what should one do? Jelena Lieberberg, yoga and movement coach, recommends plyometrics as an extremely effective way to protect your joints. Let's dig deeper...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an IG post, Jelena said “Ageing naturally brings a decline in muscular strength, bone density, and neuromuscular function. This can lead to an increased risk of falls, fractures, and a general loss of independence. However, engaging in plyometric training can help mitigate these effects and even reverse some age-related declines. Some studies have shown that if you’re unable or unwilling to jump, you’re at a higher risk of falling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Daily physical activity boosts brain function in middle-aged, older adults: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that plyometric exercises enhance power production, while simultaneously strengthening joints and decreasing the risk of injuries. and improving functional movement in those over 40. Let's see how..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What Is Plyometrics and how does it build power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plyometric exercises require muscles to extend rapidly before they contract forcefully through movements, such as jumping and bounding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stretch-shortening pattern in plyometric exercises enables muscles to generate increased force output, during shorter time periods which targets fast-twitch fibers, that control power and speed. Research shows that plyometric training enhances power output through better muscle performance, and nerve-muscle coordination. The fast-paced high-intensity movements activate fast muscle fibers more effectively than slow exercises, which results in better performance in jump height, speed and strength development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why do people over 40 need it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults over 40, need to develop strength, because it enables them to execute their daily activities, including stair climbing, quick standing and grocery carrying. The body learns to generate force quickly through plyometric training, which becomes essential for preventing falls and sustaining independence as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plyometric exercises help both protect and strengthen your joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main concern for those over 40, involves maintaining healthy joints particularly in their knees, hips and ankles. The muscles and ligaments that support joints become stronger through plyometric exercises, which lead to better joint stability. Research shows that plyometric training, strengthens knee and hip muscles, while improving their ability to handle forces during movement. The improved joint mechanics from plyometric training, helps decrease stress on joint structures which prevents injuries like strains and sprains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controlled impact during plyometric exercises helps build bone density, which protects against osteoporosis and fractures. Experts advise people to use bent knees when landing from plyometric exercises, because this technique helps absorb impact. Plyometric exercises performed correctly and with gradual progression, are safe for joints, while building their strength over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Specific advantages for those over 40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural process of aging leads to muscle power reduction and neuromuscular system deterioration, which raises the danger of accidents and injuries. Plyometric training enables older adults to enhance their muscle power, balance and coordination abilities, which helps counteract age-related muscle decline. Research findings demonstrated that older adults who participated in plyometric training, achieved better results in jump height, stair climbing and daily activities than participants who followed walking or slow resistance training programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system learns to perform movements more efficiently through plyometric training, which leads to better proprioception or body awareness, that helps with balance. The combination of better balance skills and increased movement confidence through plyometric training, helps people live longer while maintaining their overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Safety guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step for beginners and people with joint problems, should include basic plyometric exercises such as step-ups and small jumps and gentle hops. The correct landing technique involves bending your knees to distribute force, while minimising stress on your joints. The exercise intensity and number of repetitions should increase, as your strength and coordination skills develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of plyometric exercises with strength training, enables muscles to develop their ability to handle powerful forces. A fitness professional who specialises in working with those over 40, should guide you through proper technique and safe progression of plyometric exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why perfect for those over 40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fast-paced nature of plyometric exercises, leads to elevated heart rates which delivers cardiovascular advantages to those over 40. The training method enhances agility, reaction speed and total physical abilities, which help people stay active while preventing disability. Plyometric training enhances neuromuscular coordination, which enables better execution of daily activities and helps manage chronic joint pain, by achieving muscle balance around joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgJBVV95cUxPZWRVQldCODJKUGg2WF93VFJmbVROYWVmOENvRTQxTWxxX2pyTnZTLW1kWXJkZ2pCZllNclZTeGZKNXVDdXBzcnVDa2VGc1JWYUM2a3YwNTZmXzZuMEtkc2dNZURPenZyTllLOTBZVjRYdlJCMmZfYVBWRWdmdzI0bndPVDlPUWhfZVR4N2pDVC1QTFVISG5oWVpEUzktOWxnVnlMblo5R1BKdW1uMzVUNWNzbWdQbTN3ZFFlYlBiS0hGSzQ1UlZBTXlydjd2OTlabjlJeHJtQjVDRklrSkhjdXlqUG0tYkk4VnM4MWotanMtNElVZ1E0ZWFRN1lFSXpmNXRNUlJ4RmNDVjBwWm1SZnpJNXBRUWFFekU4cHBMZFNFR1dlNzQxcENR</guid></item><item><title>新冠疫苗在研究揭示可能的健康风险后接受新的审查- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/covid-vaccine-under-scrutiny-studies-120024985.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two large studies have put a spotlight on potential health risks of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;

"Obviously, old people go to the hospital more for colds and upper respiratory infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/shingles-vaccine-connected-exciting-health-benefits-large-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shingles Vaccine Connected To ‘Exciting’ Health Benefits In Large Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shingles Vaccine Connected To ‘Exciting’ Health Benefits In Large Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that because the study was observational, it does not prove that the vaccine caused the rise in infections, but only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, older adults and people with chronic conditions are more likely to receive &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/anyone-over-50-should-getting-vaccines-doctors-say" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:booster doses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;booster doses&lt;/a&gt;, which may influence the results, Song noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in "&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:care-seeking behavior;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;care-seeking behavior&lt;/a&gt;" and patterns of medical use pose another limitation, he said.

"This deserves to be looked at further."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also had limitations, the researchers acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those included gaps in the electronic health record data — it lacked information on vaccine doses and antibody levels, as well as details of kidney problems, other health conditions and over-the-counter medications that may affect the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it was a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:retrospective study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;retrospective study&lt;/a&gt; and not a controlled trial, differences between groups may have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hua Wang, associate professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois’ Grainger College of Engineering, encourages people to be cautious when interpreting data in this type of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both benefits and risks are reported in both studies, so we should not simply highlight the potential negative effects of COVID-19 vaccination as some news articles stated," said Wang, who was not involved in the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One potential limitation of the two studies is the lack of information on the fraction of participants being diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SARS-COVID-2 virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SARS-COVID-2 virus&lt;/a&gt; in the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups," the professor added.

There’s no denying that liver play the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;most crucial role in digestion, detoxification, metabolism and overall health. However, erratic sleep cycles, poor eating habits or excessive stress and overindulgence of food and drinks, may often lead to an excess fat accumulation and inflammation on the surface of liver and may cause development of small bulges and fibroids, which in a way can impact the liver and may lead to the fatty liver diseases and negatively affecting liver function. However, there are certain natural drinks with potent nutrients and bioactive compounds that can help reduce liver fat, lower inflammation, and also help in effective liver detoxification. Read on and try out these simple drinks at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sipping on a warm green tea daily may reduce liver fat and inflammation. This is because Green tea is rich in catechins, especially Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is a powerful antioxidant that aids in reducing liver fat and inflammation. In fact, clinical studies show that green tea extracts improve liver enzyme levels and reduce fat accumulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

			&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have known that moving our bodies can sharpen our minds. Physical activity &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9"&gt;boosts blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.034"&gt;enhances neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nri3041"&gt;reduces chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. These processes are believed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03955-6"&gt;to protect against cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03955-6"&gt;including dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite decades of research, major questions have remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does exercising at any age help reduce your risk of dementia? Or only when you're young? And what if you have a higher genetic risk – can exercising still make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-is-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;A Common Diabetes Drug Is Linked to 'Exceptional Longevity' in Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.44439"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from the long-running Framingham Heart Study in the United States, published today, offers some of the clearest answers to date. Their findings support what many clinicians already tell patients: exercise helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study also offers new insight into the potentially protective effect of staying active at the age of 45 and over – even for those with a certain genetic predisposition to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study examine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research draws on data from 4,290 participants enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/framingham-heart-study-fhs"&gt;This study&lt;/a&gt; began in 1948, when researchers recruited more than 5,000 adults aged 30 and over from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts, to investigate long-term risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, a second generation (more than 5,000 adult children of the original cohort, and their spouses) were enrolled, forming the &lt;a href="https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/framoffspring/"&gt;Offspring cohort&lt;/a&gt;. This generation then had regular health and medical assessments every four to eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182386" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--642x361.jpg" alt="Silhouettes of many people running at sunset" class="size-medium wp-image-182386" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header--600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/best_age_exercise_dementia_header-.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182386" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Framingham Heart Study included measures of physical activity over generations. &lt;span&gt;(K.C.

This included incidental activity such as climbing stairs as well as vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first reported these activities in 1971, and then again over several decades. Based on the age at which each participant was first evaluated, they were grouped into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;young adulthood (26–44 years): assessed in the late 1970s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;midlife (45–64 years): assessed during the late 1980s and 1990s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;older adulthood (65 years and over): assessed in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine how physical activity influences dementia risk, the researchers looked at how many people developed dementia in each age group and at what age they were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they considered physical activity patterns within age groups (low, moderate, high) to see if there was any link between how much exercise people did and whether they developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at who had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30412-9"&gt;a known genetic risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182379" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, the APOE ε4 allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Man doing freestyle in a pool." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/703327/original/file-20251119-56-2ggcoy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Research has long shown moving our bodies can sharpen our minds.

Those with the highest levels of activity in midlife and later life were 41–45% less likely to develop dementia than those who had the lowest levels of activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the case even after adjusting for demographic factors that increase dementia risk (such as age and education) and other chronic health factors (such as high blood pressure and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="182379" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interestingly, being physically active during early adulthood did not influence dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key innovation of this study was its examination of the genetic risk factor, the APOE ε4 allele. This analysis suggests something new:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in midlife, higher physical activity lowered dementia risk only in people who didn't carry this genetic predisposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but in later life, higher physical activity lowered dementia risk in both carriers and non-carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means for people genetically predisposed to dementia, staying active later in life may still offer meaningful protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How significant are these results?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings largely reinforce what scientists already know: exercise is good for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets this study apart is its large sample, multi-decade follow-up, and its genetic analysis across different life periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion that midlife activity benefits some individuals differently depending on their genetic risk, while late-life activity benefits nearly everyone, may also add a new layer to public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;This Much Weekly Exercise Can Slash Your Dementia Risk by 41 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But there were some limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity was largely self-reported in this study, so there is a possibility of recall bias. We also do not know what type of exercise brings the best benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia cases in the youngest age group were rather rare too, so the small sample limits how definitively we can make conclusions about early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohort is also predominantly of European ancestry and share environmental factors as they come from the same town, so this limits how much we can generalise the findings to more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important given &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100179"&gt;global inequities in dementia risk and diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. Knowledge about dementia and risk factors also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajag.70071"&gt;remains low&lt;/a&gt; in ethnically diverse groups, where it is often still seen as a "normal" part of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is refreshingly simple though: move more, at any age. At this stage we know there are more benefits than harm.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270074/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
