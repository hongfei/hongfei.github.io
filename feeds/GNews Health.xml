It persists not for lack of science or solutions, but because leaders have failed to act with the urgency and commitment the crisis demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A consortium of more than 50 partners, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), is responding to these outbreaks through the &lt;a href="https://www.gtfcc.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Task Force on Cholera Control&lt;/a&gt;– a partnership established in 1992 to enable access to essential supplies, as well as work on the detection, prevention and treatment of cholera and set global priorities to sustainably control the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Complementing the work of the taskforce, in August the WHO and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a continental cholera emergency response plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b6c02be-b19e-4970-9fc8-43b3873fb026" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sudan cholera outbreak kills 40 in a week as health centres overwhelmed","elementId":"8b6c02be-b19e-4970-9fc8-43b3873fb026","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/14/sudan-cholera-outbreak-water-health-medecins-sans-frontieres-msf-war-refugees"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cholera is caused by a bacterium ingested in food or water contaminated with faeces from an infected person, and the only way to prevent it is by ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. This is why it is now practically unheard of in countries with those facilities, but thrives in communities afflicted by inequality, poverty, conflict, displacement and climate-related disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The disease can be prevented with effective vaccines. An injectable vaccine was first developed in the late 19th century, and was superseded by oral vaccines in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But because the disease afflicts almost exclusively the poorest countries and communities, the vaccine does not attract investment from developers, for whom it offers little market opportunity. There is currently only one manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns: EUBiologics, based in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To manage cholera outbreaks, the WHO and other partners established a global &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/icg/cholera/stockpiles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cholera vaccine stockpile&lt;/a&gt; for outbreaks in 2013 under the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG) to ensure rapid, equitable and effective access to vaccines in emergencies, especially in low-resource settings. Since then, the stockpile has distributed almost 255m doses of vaccine to 34 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost 75% of those doses have been distributed since 2021, in response to the global resurgence of cholera. So far this year, the stockpile has disbursed more than 49m vaccine doses – already eclipsing the previous record for a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Given the increasing frequency and severity of outbreaks, vaccines from the stockpile can only be used to bring outbreaks under control, rather than to conduct preventive campaigns in areas at risk of cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The stockpile is replenished every week but production cannot keep up with demand, and it is regularly below the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended threshold&lt;/a&gt; of having 5m doses ready to respond to outbreaks at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To stretch supplies further, the ICG suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in 2022 in favour of a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Single-dose vaccination is only therefore a temporary solution to scarce supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Demand shows no sign of abating, meaning supply must increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In October 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zambia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s Jijia Medical Technology Company to establish a cholera vaccine-production facility in Lusaka. The planned production will still require rigorous quality assurance and clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy before any locally manufactured doses can be approved by the WHO and deployed in mass vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While expanding vaccine production in Africa is essential for preventing and responding to outbreaks of this historical disease, the only long-term solution is for governments to invest in safe drinking water and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are some diseases that cannot be completely prevented, such as Alzheimer’s and most cancers. But cholera is not one of them – it can be stopped. Cholera persists because poverty, inequality, conflict and displacement persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stopping it is therefore not a scientific, medical or technical challenge; fundamentally, it’s a political one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 13:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQNDZVMmVrdS1LWkNudG1oSkZNTTFibjBjcUM1VlYtbVloOTN0RU5iR242QzRyTi04ZHA0aHByYjNWWEhQT1pELTZBOS16QUNiZHRVbENBZ2JlQXRQeHdjb1dZM0Y3RXZBNDRHdkdMSExUSkEwV0FCQ1NSenR5NjUyNVJvZEpNb2oyN0VLeVlvSHhPMFRLZE11clRySnhtN1V4ZWdELVBDWU9nbElVaG5QZnMtRQ</guid></item><item><title>在刷牙之前或之后，您应该用牙线清洁牙齿吗？牙医揭示正确的技术- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/floss-teeth-brush-them-dentists-103200640.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Should You Floss Your Teeth Before You Brush?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;PeopleImages - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know you should brush teeth twice and floss once a day at a minimum to keep your teeth clean and breath fresh. But it turns out those two things may make a difference in both the cleanliness of your mouth and the health of your whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to protecting your smile, maintaining excellent oral hygiene contributes to better overall health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.aae.org/patients/directory/people/steven-j-katz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Steven J. Katz, DDS, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Steven J. Katz, DDS, MS&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the American Association of Endodontists. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(23)00755-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research has shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people who take care of their teeth and gums also enjoy a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, improved control of diabetes, and even &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2025/25_0083.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:better cognitive health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;better cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; as they age.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure you’re taking the best possible care of your teeth so you can reap those potential health benefits, you may want to rethink your dental care routine. We reached out to two dentists to find out if it makes a difference whether you brush your teeth first and floss after, or floss first and brush after. Apparently it does!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we need to floss our teeth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flossing entails sticking something thin (usually a special string) between your teeth and moving it around to help dislodge any matter that shouldn’t be there, which supports the health of our entire mouth. “Flossing is a simple yet crucial step in maintaining oral health, as it removes debris and plaque from areas your toothbrush can’t reach,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aspendental.com%2Fproviders%2Fashley-boling%2F1265743710%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa69000438%2Fshould-you-floss-your-teeth-before-or-after-you-brush%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashley Boling, DDS/DMD;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashley Boling, DDS/DMD&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist and the owner of an Aspen Dental practice in Hixon, Tennessee. “This &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7375740/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduces the risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduces the risk&lt;/a&gt; of cavities, gum disease and other dental issues.” As noted above, those dental problems can also put you at risk for additional whole-body health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you floss before or after brushing your teeth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might sound counterintuitive to put floss between teeth that you know are still dirty, but &lt;strong&gt;it’s best to floss first and brush second.&lt;/strong&gt; “Flossing first removes food particles and plaque from between the teeth — areas that a toothbrush simply can’t reach,” says Katz. &lt;strong&gt;“Clearing out those spaces not only reduces the risk of cavities and gum disease, but also allows the fluoride in your toothpaste to reach more surfaces of your teeth.&lt;/strong&gt; That means &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stronger enamel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stronger enamel&lt;/a&gt;, healthier gums, and better protection against decay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boling agrees. “You can floss before or after brushing as long as you are doing it thoroughly and are reaching areas that your toothbrush can’t,” she says. &lt;strong&gt;“Flossing beforehand, however, can help dislodge food particles and plaque, making brushing more effective.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the best time of day to floss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best time to floss your teeth is the time that you will stick to every day. “For many people, &lt;strong&gt;the easiest habit is to floss at night before brushing and right before bed,” says Katz. “That way, you go to sleep with a clean, healthy mouth.&lt;/strong&gt; Once flossing becomes part of your nightly routine, you’ll quickly notice that it feels incomplete when you skip it — almost like forgetting to wash your face or lock the door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best flossing tool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find &lt;strong&gt;traditional string floss to be the most effective for scraping plaque from beneath the gumline, but tools like floss picks and water flossers are great alternatives,&lt;/strong&gt; especially for those with dexterity challenges or braces,” says Boling. “The key is consistency — the best flossing tool is the one you’ll use regularly!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pro 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UKM9CO?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.69000438%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$39.94 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$39.94 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4100 Power Toothbrush&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LD7WRVS?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.69000438%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$39.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$39.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9900 Prestige Rechargeable Electric Power Toothbrush with SenseIQ&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YCVJKXV?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.69000438%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$349.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$349.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent brushing and flossing, combined with regular dental visits, are the best way to maintain strong oral health and avoid complex dental procedures,” says Katz.

Dr. Venkatsubramaniam, a senior urologist in Chennai lists these 5 habits….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>应用程序使用人工智能来帮助患者记住预约信息- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0ydgd89ndo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;An app designed to help people remember and summarise information from medical appointments using artificial intelligence (AI) has launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Created by Oxford-based company Aide Health, the Mirror app records appointments and gives a summary afterwards that the patient can refer back to and share with carers and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Creator Ian Wharton said the platform was a "really modern application of AI to solve a challenge that is this hidden risk in every healthcare consultation that we have".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said he came up with the idea to help his dad, who has early-stage Alzheimer's, to ensure he did not miss information from doctors appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It was the vast majority of information that was given to him that he just couldn't recall, and my biggest fear was not being by his bedside when he was told something important," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They're moments of quite often intense information, which are very very brief for you to digest often high-stakes news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Mirror app listens into medical appointments, and produces a detailed summary of what has been said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Janette Alfrey was one of the first people to use the platform, and said it left her "quite stunned".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It had given me a heading as to why I was there, and then it had talked about what was about to happen and why they were doing it, and what was going to happen when they did the next operation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When friends and colleagues phoned up over the next couple of days asking what was going to happen, I could just send them a screenshot of what I was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It saved me having to go through everything again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Mr Wharton said patients' data recorded by the app was "theirs, we don't do anything with it -

It changed how I started my day, because what I eat at 11 a.m. affects how I feel at 7 p.m.,” said Berardi, 43. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Continuous glucose monitors have become hugely popular and a billion-dollar business. While still a small percent of the overall market, the over-the-counter segment is nonetheless expected to grow to $2 billion by 2034, from $370 million in 2024, according to research firm  Global Market Insights. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brand leaders such as Stelo from Dexcom and Lingo from Abbott are sold over the counter for adults not using insulin for about $80 each, or less with subscriptions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Devices typically last about 2 weeks, and a subscription can cover replacements as well as access to data and other analysis through a mobile app. Costs vary depending on the length of the subscription; Abbott, for example, advertises a 12-week Lingo plan for $249&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;New brands targeting weight-loss monitors, such as Signos, offer promotions that include a subscription, two devices, and the mobile app for $130 a month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet despite their widespread use, researchers have only a limited understanding of how they might benefit people without diabetes. Proponents say the monitors can help people make healthier lifestyle choices. But some experts caution that without more thorough vetting, the data can be misinterpreted and should not be used as a replacement for the routine pre-diabetic screening doctors perform at annual exams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A new study from researchers at Mass General Brigham suggests that the usefulness of continuous glucose monitors in tracking blood sugar varies depending on a person’s level of diabetes risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The team examined how a lab test, hemoglobin A1c, which measures average blood sugar over several months, compared with eight different measures from glucose monitors, which record blood sugar levels every 5 minutes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers analyzed data from nearly 1,000&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;adults ages 40 or older, including those with and without diabetes. The data was provided by patients who wore the G6 monitor from Dexcom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Participants’ readings for type 2 diabetes closely matched their A1c test results. However, the correlation was weaker for people with prediabetes and those with normal blood sugar, even when researchers accounted for factors such as body mass index, according to the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Jorge Rodriguez, a co-author of the study, hypothesized that in people without diabetes, short glucose spikes from meals don’t last long enough to affect the three-month averages of an A1c test. But among diabetics, glucose levels stay elevated longer, so data recorded by the monitors align better with A1c tests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“As a physician, it is important to me to be able to advise all patients who may increasingly use these monitors,” said Rodriguez, an internal medicine hospitalist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. “In those without diabetes, [continuous glucose monitors] may be useful as behavioral ‘biofeedback’ tools that can provide insight into how food and activity impact real-time blood sugar levels, but they do not directly reflect longer-term blood sugar control.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The devices, which track blood sugar through a tiny sensor placed just beneath the skin, have helped people with type 1 diabetes prevent dangerous overnight drops and improve glucose control for those who rely on insulin. About 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes, and nearly half of those with Type 1 diabetes wear a continuous glucose monitor, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rodriguez said they launched the study last year as the FDA approved the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors. Around a half-dozen companies now market them, including Dexcom and Levels, which Trump’s Surgeon General co-founded. Rodriguez said there’s a need for more research into how well the devices predict someone’s risk of developing diabetes or dying of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“These tools could still be powerful at a personalized level and add value by seeing the impact of sugar, identifying it, and helping you make different choices... like what you chose to eat for lunch,” Rodriguez said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, founder of Signos, a health platform promoted to non-diabetics, said the technology offers a glimpse into how bodies process energy and coaches people toward better health. Signos is the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring system to be cleared by the FDA specifically for weight management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What works for one person doesn’t necessarily work for another, and the technology offered the only glimpse into how our bodies were processing the energy we intake,” said Fouladgar-Mercer, who said he was obese before using a glucose monitor. “We built a solution that helps people connect with what they eat, how they move, the way they feel with the data on the screen, so you don’t have to wait to see the number on the scale move.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rodriguez said rapid changes in glucose could have downstream effects on hearts and kidneys, which is “normally seen in people with diabetes, but there’s a gap in understanding how it could impact those without diabetes. There’s still research to be done,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Berardi noticed that even modest periods of movement — walking after eating — made a measurable difference in her blood sugar.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;But after acquiring what she called “enough insight,” she stopped using the device, citing the cost as a barrier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Food is so powerful, and [glucose monitors] empower people to really see how it impacts all those biomarkers,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the American Diabetes Association, normal blood glucose levels for an adult without diabetes are below 100 mg/dL when fasting and below 140 mg/dL two hours after meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rodriguez said he and his colleagues launched a separate study with around 10 participants to extend the findings and explore if people are changing their behaviors based on the readings of their continuous glucose monitors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Samir Malkani, an endocrinologist and diabetes specialist at UMass Memorial Medical Center, called the use of blood-sugar monitors by non-diabetics “uncharted territory.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Why are we so worried about people who are in the normal range? The main advantage of monitors is to flag when things are out of range,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Berardi is glad she tried&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the device and thinks more people will start using continuous glucose monitors to track their wellness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’m happy I did because this is a proactive approach to good metabolic health, versus the reactive, symptomatic approach that I think we’re so used to,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

						Near the end of his reign, French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte led an army of over half a million men in an invasion of Russia in 1812. Six months later, after the army was forced to retreat, an estimated tens of thousands of his soldiers made it back to France.Known as one of the costliest wars in history, the death of hundreds of thousands of soldiers has been attributed to battle, as well as starvation, cold and a typhus epidemic that broke out.Now, researchers have found evidence in the DNA remains of the soldiers that there may have been multiple diseases that devastated the army, including two previously undetected types of bacteria. The study was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.“Previously, we just thought that there was one infectious disease that decimated the Napoleon army — the typhus,” said lead author Rémi Barbieri, a former postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur in Paris who currently holds a postdoctoral position at Estonia’s University of Tartu. Instead, the researchers found something unexpected, opening the door to potentially uncovering other infectious diseases that could have contributed to the soldiers’ deaths, he added.The researchers found the pathogens — Salmonella enterica and Borrelia recurrentis, bacteria that cause paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever, respectively — by analyzing teeth from the fallen soldiers who were found in a mass grave uncovered in 2001 in Vilnius, Lithuania.The new findings not only give a clearer picture of a significant historical event, but they highlight how technology has advanced and opened the door to understanding historical circumstances, researchers say.Mixing pot of diseaseWhen Napoleon and his troops reached Moscow, they weren’t met with Russian soldiers. Instead, the city was abandoned, with burnt crops and no supplies available, such as safe food to eat or clean clothing. As the harsh winter months approached, the French army was forced to retreat, but not without facing many hardships.Rickettsia prowazekii, the bacterium responsible for typhus, was first detected in the teeth of Napoleon’s soldiers during a 2006 study, but the research was limited by the technology at that time. To find out if typhus was the sole culprit for the demise of soldiers, the authors of the new study used a method known as high-throughput sequencing, which can sequence millions of DNA fragments at a time. It allows for highly degraded DNA to be identified, such as the genome fragments extracted from samples more than 200 years old.“This is something that can be only done with these machines that are very powerful to go and sequence a lot of high quantity of DNA,” said study coauthor Nicolás Rascovan, supervisor of the research and head of the Microbial Paleogenomics Unit at the Institut Pasteur. “This sort of analysis, these kinds of projects, can really give a much clearer picture about the landscape of infectious disease in the past … and how (historical events) have also shaped the landscape of infectious diseases today.”The study authors looked at 13 samples and found no traces of typhus, but their work does not discredit the findings of the 2006 study, the researchers noted. The study sample is also too small to know the exact impact the diseases had on Napoleon’s army. “What changes (with) our study is the fact that now we have direct evidence there were several different infectious diseases present in this site,” Rascovan said. It is likely that more diseases were at play that have yet to be detected, he added.Cecil Lewis, an ancient DNA researcher who studies the human microbiome, said the results were not particularly surprising, but he called it a meaningful contribution to “our understanding of the demise of Napoleon’s army.” Lewis, vice president of academics at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, was not involved with the study.“We are now in a period where ancient DNA studies can contribute more nuance to the understanding of such historic events, which is exciting,” Lewis said in an email. “Studying historical and ancient pathogens, their place in history, offers a glimpse into the evolutionary paths organisms have taken, some now extinct, others forming the foundation of present-day pathogens. These data help us better understand the possibilities for how pathogens can impact lives, evolve, and persist, which is crucial for anticipating and managing future threats.”Paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever are still around today, but are not as common or as deadly. Napoleon survived the retreat, but his dwindling army ultimately contributed to his fall from power a few years later.“Something that is quite impressive is how, in so little time, since 2006 with the first study to today, the technologies have been developed so much that we can do things that were impossible to even conceive a few years ago and now are possible,” Rascovan said. “So I am very excited to think what is going to be next in terms of technological developments.”

						Near the end of his reign, French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte led an army of over half a million men in an invasion of Russia in 1812. Six months later, after the army was forced to retreat, an estimated tens of thousands of his soldiers made it back to France.Known as one of the costliest wars in history, the death of hundreds of thousands of soldiers has been attributed to battle, as well as starvation, cold and a typhus epidemic that broke out.Now, researchers have found evidence in the DNA remains of the soldiers that there may have been multiple diseases that devastated the army, including two previously undetected types of bacteria. The study was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.“Previously, we just thought that there was one infectious disease that decimated the Napoleon army — the typhus,” said lead author Rémi Barbieri, a former postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur in Paris who currently holds a postdoctoral position at Estonia’s University of Tartu. Instead, the researchers found something unexpected, opening the door to potentially uncovering other infectious diseases that could have contributed to the soldiers’ deaths, he added.The researchers found the pathogens — Salmonella enterica and Borrelia recurrentis, bacteria that cause paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever, respectively — by analyzing teeth from the fallen soldiers who were found in a mass grave uncovered in 2001 in Vilnius, Lithuania.The new findings not only give a clearer picture of a significant historical event, but they highlight how technology has advanced and opened the door to understanding historical circumstances, researchers say.Mixing pot of diseaseWhen Napoleon and his troops reached Moscow, they weren’t met with Russian soldiers.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new 18-month study found that adults following a calorie-restricted “green-MED” diet — rich in green tea, walnuts, and the leafy plant mankai — showed signs of slower brain aging compared to those on standard healthy-eating or traditional Mediterranean diets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers connected decreases in certain blood proteins related to brain aging, especially galectin-9, to the green-MED group’s diet high in polyphenols and low in red and processed meats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the findings show correlation rather than causation, scientists say the results could eventually support simple blood tests to monitor brain health and cognitive aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists just gave us another reason to enjoy a cup of green tea today, because it turns out, it might help your brain age more slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In October, a team of international researchers, including those from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, Harvard University in Massachusetts, and the University of Leipzig in Germany, published the results of their 18-month secondary analysis of brain aging in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614%2825%2900235-3/fulltext" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team followed nearly 300 adults who participated in the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03020186" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DIRECT PLUS trial,&lt;/a&gt; where each was randomly assigned to one of three diets: one based on "general" healthy-eating guidelines; another following the calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet (with 1,500–1,800 calories a day for men and 1,200–1,400 calories for women); and the last adhering to a “green-MED” diet that was also calorie-restricted but higher in polyphenols and lower in red and processed meats (replacing beef and lamb with poultry and fish). It turns out that the last one might be the secret to better brain aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the paper explained, the Green-MED group consumed a daily serving of walnuts (28 grams, to be exact), drank between three and four cups of green tea, and had a mankai shake each day — derived from a green leafy plant that supplies complete proteins. All participants, regardless of their diet group, had access to a gym and guidance on physical activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the 18 months, the researchers combined MRI scans taken before and after the experiment with a machine-learning model to estimate each participant's brain age. They then calculated a "brain age gap" by comparing the MRI-estimated brain age with the person's actual chronological age. A positive gap indicated accelerated brain aging, while a negative gap suggested the brain is aging more slowly than the person's chronological age (i.e., it is "younger" than the person's birthday would indicate).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the start of the study, participants whose brains appeared younger than their actual age tended to share a few traits: they weighed less, had smaller waistlines, lower blood pressure, and healthier blood sugar levels. When researchers examined blood samples before the diet changes, two proteins also stood out: galectin-9 (Gal-9) and decorin (DCN). Higher levels of either were tied to an “older” brain. In their discussion, the authors also cited prior research showing that high levels of decorin in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with early Alzheimer’s changes. And for both proteins, particularly GAL-9, diet choices played an essential role in brain health over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood markers for these proteins shifted depending on which diet participants followed, with the green-MED group showing the most significant changes. These participants showed the greatest reduction in GAL-9 protein, followed by the Mediterranean group, which showed slight reductions. The markers of the healthy guideline group went essentially unchanged.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Studying the circulating proteins in blood allows us to observe, in a real-life setting, how the brain’s aging processes are influenced by lifestyle and dietary changes," Dr. Anat Yaskolka-Meir, postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard and the co-first author of the paper, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098285" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt;. "This approach gives us a dynamic window into brain health, helping to reveal biological changes long before symptoms may appear. By mapping these protein signatures, we gain powerful new insight into how interventions, such as diet, may help preserve cognitive function as we age.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers noted some significant limitations in their study, notably that about 90% of the participants were men who initially had abdominal obesity. The machine learning model's ability to predict the brain age gap was also limited, and although the study found a link between the green-MED diet and decreased brain aging, they cannot yet establish causation. Nevertheless, these findings and their recommendations for brain health contribute to an increasing body of research suggesting that consuming more polyphenol-rich foods like green tea and walnuts, along with reducing processed and red meats, could offer substantial health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And perhaps most importantly, the authors suggest their findings could someday enable medical and scientific professionals to better understand brain health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “In this study, we are taking a small step toward a new possibility," Dafna Pachter, a Ph.D. student and the first author of the paper, said. "A simple, accessible, and affordable blood test that could, in the future, provide an indication of brain status by analyzing omics layers in the blood." &lt;br&gt;

Their discovery combines near-infrared LED light with nanoscopic flakes of tin oxide, known as &lt;a href="https://utaustinportugal.org/"&gt;SnOx nanoflakes&lt;/a&gt;, to kill &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-cell-8247"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; while leaving healthy ones unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-suggests-covid-mrna-vaccines-help-fight-cancer-too"&gt;Study Suggests COVID MRNA Vaccines Help Fight Cancer Too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178822" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LEDSystemActivatesSnOxNanoflakesToNeutraliseCancerCell.jpg" alt="Illustration of LED system used to fight cancer" class="wp-image-178822 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LEDSystemActivatesSnOxNanoflakesToNeutraliseCancerCell.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LEDSystemActivatesSnOxNanoflakesToNeutraliseCancerCell-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178822" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers' custom near-infrared LED heating system activates SnOx nanoflakes that heat and neutralize cancer cells (green: live cells; red: cells killed by photothermal therapy). (&lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/10/09/led-light-blasts-cancer-cells-and-spares-healthy-ones/"&gt;The University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks an important advance in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40169560/"&gt;photothermal therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that uses light to heat and destroy tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the process relies on inexpensive, accessible LED systems rather than specialized lasers. The approach reduces damage to surrounding tissues and could one day offer a safer and less invasive alternative &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/chemotherapy-588"&gt;to chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/radiation-therapy-39517"&gt;or radiotherapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of the innovation is a simple concept: using light to create localized heat that targets and kills cancer cells. The team designed the SnOx nanoflakes to absorb near-infrared light efficiently, a wavelength that can safely penetrate biological tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When illuminated, these nanoflakes act like microscopic heaters, producing enough warmth to disrupt cancer cell membranes and proteins, ultimately causing cell death. Healthy tissues remain largely unaffected because they are less sensitive to heat and because the nanoflakes can be directed specifically toward malignant cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-020-0410-2"&gt;targeted heating process&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02140-y"&gt;photothermal therapy&lt;/a&gt;, relies on a physical rather than chemical mechanism. This means it can avoid many of the systemic side effects typically seen with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional photothermal systems use lasers because they can focus light precisely deep within tissue. However, that same intensity can also damage healthy cells, requires costly equipment, and limits use to highly specialized facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers replaced lasers with light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which emit a gentler, broader spectrum of light. LEDs produce more uniform heating and are far less likely to burn or harm healthy tissue. They are also inexpensive and portable, making them well suited for clinical or even at-home use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03135"&gt;laboratory studies&lt;/a&gt;, the LED light combined with SnOx nanoflakes destroyed up to 92 percent of skin cancer cells and 50 percent of colorectal cancer cells within 30 minutes. Healthy human skin cells were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This level of selectivity makes the technique particularly promising for cancers such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, which can be treated directly through light exposure. Such precision is rare among photothermal technologies, which often risk harming surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying science is equally significant. Tin oxide is a stable, biocompatible material already used in electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By converting tin disulfide (SnS₂) into oxygenated tin oxide nanoflakes, the researchers created structures that absorb near-infrared light much more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transformation improves photothermal performance and allows the nanoflakes to be made using water-based, non-toxic synthesis methods. The process avoids harmful solvents and expensive manufacturing steps, making it scalable, sustainable and suitable for medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team envisions compact LED devices that could be applied directly to the skin after surgical tumor removal to destroy any remaining malignant cells and reduce the risk of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, after removing a melanoma or basal cell carcinoma, a patch-like LED device could deliver focused light to activate the nanoflakes at the surgical site. This type of portable, home-based treatment could make post-surgical cancer care safer, more convenient and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40170176/"&gt;less dependent&lt;/a&gt; on hospital visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovation also opens the door to combination therapies. Photothermal treatment can make cancer cells more vulnerable to other forms of therapy, such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9760263/"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452262725000285"&gt;targeted drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat generated by light can weaken tumor cells, make their membranes more permeable and trigger immune responses that help the body identify and destroy cancer. Integrating LED-based photothermal therapy with other approaches could make treatment plans more precise, effective and less toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although still in the early stages, the researchers are refining the technology and exploring new applications. They are studying how different wavelengths and exposure times affect outcomes and investigating whether other materials similar to tin oxide could reach deeper tissues, such as those affected by breast or colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area of development is implantable nanoflake systems: tiny biocompatible devices that could provide ongoing photothermal control inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential for accessibility is one of the most exciting aspects of this work. Because LED-based devices are inexpensive to manufacture and simple to operate, they could be used in low-resource regions where access to cancer care is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38571427/"&gt;This could democratize&lt;/a&gt; advanced treatment by extending it beyond major hospitals. For superficial cancers detected early, LED therapy might even be incorporated into outpatient or cosmetic procedures, reducing recovery time and improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety is another major advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy damages rapidly dividing healthy cells across the body, and radiotherapy can harm normal tissue and cause fatigue or scarring. Photothermal therapy, by contrast, confines its effects to the illuminated site. It produces no systemic toxicity, no cumulative organ damage and minimal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx6350"&gt;precision&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40802759/"&gt;stems&lt;/a&gt; from both the optical targeting and the biological selectivity of the nanoflakes, which preferentially heat cancer cells due to their altered metabolism and greater sensitivity to thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to translate these laboratory findings into preclinical and, eventually, human trials. While much work remains, LED-driven photothermal therapy could represent a shift in how we treat cancer, making therapies more precise, affordable and humane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light, one of nature's simplest energies, could become a powerful medical tool for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8002224/"&gt;selectively destroying tumors&lt;/a&gt; without harming healthy tissue. With innovations such as SnOx nanoflakes, the vision of non-invasive, localized, patient-friendly cancer treatment is coming steadily closer to reality.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267556/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

So far, students in over 40 schools have reported cases of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A warning has gone out to parents of Prince George’s County Public Schools students about a spike in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hand, foot and mouth disease.&lt;/a&gt; So far students in more than 40 schools have reported cases of the virus, impacting students from preschool to high school, since the school year began in late August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a communicable disease,” said Dr. Traci Jones, who is the supervisor for the Office of School Health for Prince George’s County Public Schools. “It is not a life-threatening communicable disease, but it is a communicable disease that is easily transmitted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said kids should be properly washing their hands and staying home if they have symptoms, such as fever or open blisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school system said the very early symptoms are similar to that of a cold: fever, lack of appetite, a sore throat and the other signs of a cold. Those appear about one to two days before blisters appear on the palms and feet, and sores develop in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can spread it and have it for up to a week, and then usually one to two days before the blisters come, that’s when you get your most infectious,” Jones said. “But you don’t know that you’re infectious at the time, because you feel perfectly fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why she repeatedly stressed the need for parents and kids to wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things I see people do now is they’re wearing gloves all the time, trying not to get it,” she said. “But if you come in contact with it and it’s on your gloves, all you’re going to do is spread it to others. So that is not an answer — to put gloves on — but hand washing is a big way of curtailing it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones also asked parents to thoroughly and repeatedly wipe down toys and other things that kids might put their hands or mouths on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Schools are increasing our cleaning protocols so that we can help curtail the spread of it. We have crews coming in after hours to clean,” she said. “We have instructed our cleaning crews to — what they would normally wait until at the end of the day to clean — do it twice a day in our attempts to curtail it as much as possible. We’re also going to start increasing hand washing for our students, making sure that’s done more frequently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any child who does get the virus is being told to stay home until they’ve been fever free for 24 hours and all blisters on their hands have crusted over. Mouth sores that can cause a child to drool also need to be closed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to try to prevent the spread of this as much as possible,” said Jones.&lt;/p&gt;

"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Clever marketing schemes," Ms Jackson says, "magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;The recommended daily amount&lt;/a&gt; for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It might make up less than 1% of us but "it is involved in over 300 different processes", Ms Jackson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is "especially important for our brain and mood," she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Katie Curran Katie Curran, a woman with green eyes, with blonde shoulder length hair " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Katie Curran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Katie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A year ago, I was struggling," she confides. "It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00970-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;an amino acid with limited evidence &lt;/a&gt;linking it to better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with "commission paid" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt; The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die'," Ms Stavridis says, "'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium," she continues, "around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6060686/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; recommended daily intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"But just taking a supplement is not the answer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Seeds, nuts, whole grain breads, greens and fruit images" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesium&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Take sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Absorption%20of%20magnesium%20from%20different,in%20the%20body%20%5B17%5D" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;affect the absorption rate of magnesium.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of "take this" and you'll be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in "expensive urine", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should "100% look at diet first".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 23:04:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE15alhGbkRDMVlYZnExZ2l4N0xqWUtnWGhENmJkUWFsNi1XQXBQNTJJd284U1VWeDI4ZUExLXpuTEJGWkEzZmo2eDQ2b19hUmhMZmFHQjE0V05KZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE8waXVSS3lVTFgyZE9WOU91OU9uSG1HcXEyOGNydFBUOElXUGpBaENhOVEzQ09xNnVpLWx2cWhtcWt2eTRYSUZMUnJJQnFIcUluckpMNnV5UlBvWmxzVWhn</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬小狗被挫败的拥抱兄弟的尝试充满了最可爱的愤怒-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-puppys-thwarted-attempt-220000851.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When we all think of Golden Retrievers, most of us picture sweet, easygoing dogs that don't have a mean bone in their bodies, and that's usually the case.

&lt;h2&gt;Deadly doses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supplements were: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-artri-king-contains-hidden-drug-ingredients"&gt;Artri King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/nhan-sam-tuyet-lien-truy-phong-hoan-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients"&gt;Nhan Sam Tuyet Lien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-linsen-double-caulis-plus-lingxianshuangtengsu-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient"&gt;Linsen Double Caulis Plus&lt;/a&gt;. All are known to contain unlisted glucocorticoids, according to the Food and Drug Administration. And testing of two of the man’s supplements by the hospital confirmed the presence of the steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors determined that the man had essentially overdosed on the glucocorticoids—he had taken doses that exceeded the normal levels of glucocorticoids in the body. The steroids likely suppressed immune responses, leading to his infections and GI ulcers. But, more significantly, the excess steroid levels also caused his HPA axis to essentially shut down. While it’s possible to get the HPA axis back up and running after withdrawal from excessive steroid use, the amount of time that takes can vary. Further, if a person stops taking large doses of glucocorticoids abruptly, rather than gradually—as in the man’s case—and particularly after chronic use—also as in the man’s case—it can lead to an &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000357.htm"&gt;adrenal crisis&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, the man had all the signs of a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors started treating him with hydrocortisone (medication cortisol) to get him out of danger. But it took six weeks before his HPA axis showed signs of recovery on tests. By that time, he had developed recurrent bacterial infections in his blood and had persistent delirium. It was only after several months in the hospital that he was able to be discharged back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the doctors describe the man’s case as a cautionary tale. Many Americans use supplements, but their efficacy is largely unproven, and they are not rigorously regulated for safety. And even though, in this case, the FDA had issued warnings specifically about the three supplements the man took, his case highlights that public awareness of such dangers remains low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clinicians must remain vigilant in assessing supplement use and educate patients on potential risks, particularly regarding hidden glucocorticoids, to prevent serious health complications such as adrenal insufficiency,” the doctors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From OpenEvidence.com:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After ingestion, bismuth is primarily found in trace amounts within organs such as the kidney, liver, spleen, and, in rare cases, the brain, where it accumulates intracellularly—especially in lysosomes and nuclear membranes—and extracellularly in basement membranes of blood vessels.[1-4] In normal therapeutic use, the amount of tissue-bound bismuth is extremely low and is not associated with adverse effects.
Potential consequences of tissue-bound bismuth are generally negligible at standard doses, but chronic or excessive exposure can lead to toxicity, most notably neurotoxicity (bismuth encephalopathy).[1][4-6] In cases of bismuth intoxication, histochemical studies have shown accumulation in neurons and glial cells, particularly in the cerebellum, thalamus, and hippocampus, with clinical manifestations including confusion, myoclonus, and encephalopathy.[1][4-6] However, these effects are reversible upon discontinuation of bismuth exposure, and recovery is typically complete within weeks.[5-6]
Animal studies confirm that bismuth binds to proteins such as ferritin and metallothionein, and is retained in lysosomes, nuclear membranes, and myelin-associated proteins.[2][4][7] The kidney is the primary site of accumulation and excretion, and tissue levels decline after cessation of exposure, with little evidence of permanent retention at therapeutic doses.[2-3]
In summary, permanent tissue binding of bismuth is minimal and clinically insignificant with standard use, but chronic high-dose exposure can result in neurotoxicity and other organ effects, which are reversible after stopping bismuth.[5-6][8-9]"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

			&lt;p&gt;Superagers retain sharp minds into their 80s and beyond, defying the idea that cognitive decline is inevitable as we age. A 25-year study of these enviable few now reveals some of what's special about their underlying neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really what we've found in their brains that's been so earth-shattering for us," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University clinical neuropsychologist Sandra Weintraub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and colleagues found superagers' brains are oddly resistant to the buildup of Alzheimer's-related protein clumps and tangles. These individuals also have a higher concentration of one specific type of neuron in a critical region of their brain, and exhibit less inflammatory activity in their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; compared to the general aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings need to be validated in other populations, identifying a distinct neurobiological profile in superagers "opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Weintraub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers have memories beyond their 80s that rival those of people in their 50s. This study defines them as capable of remembering at least 9 words out of a list of 15 when tested, which is typical of people at least two to three decades younger. Some studies have found that &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2017/04/scientists-have-discovered-why-some-people-are-super-agers/"&gt;less than five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the population can achieve a superager classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-5-superagers-what-they-have-in-common-elderly-sharp-cognitive"&gt;High extroversion&lt;/a&gt; is one trait superagers have in common with each other. Oddly, superagers aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-5-superagers-what-they-have-in-common-elderly-sharp-cognitive"&gt;necessarily leading healthier lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, with some smoking and drinking alcohol regularly; a factor that suggests a significant component of these folks' age-resisting superpowers is biological.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SuperagerWhoWasPartOfStudySitsWithWife-e1760929873749.jpg" alt="SuperAger Ralph Rehbock sits with his wife in his home.

(Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and team monitored 290 people aged 80 and older since 2000 to compare those who would turn out to be superagers with those who age typically. Thanks also to generous donations of 79 superager brains, the researchers identified some key biological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a superager," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Weintraub. "One is resistance: they don't make the plaques and tangles [typically associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178196" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease]. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don't do anything to their brains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells that deliver information to the hippocampus, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entorhinal_cortex"&gt;entorhinal neurons&lt;/a&gt;, were larger in superagers, possibly contributing to this resistance or resilience, the researchers suggest in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178199" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DonatedSuperagerBrainBeingHeldInLab-e1760929713642.jpg" alt="Donated superager brain being held in lab" class="wp-image-178199 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178199" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lab member holds a donated SuperAger brain. (Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, typically aging people had thinning in the outer brain layer, whereas superagers did not. This area of the brain governs our conscious thoughts, memory, and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers also had more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Economo_neuron"&gt;von Economo neurons&lt;/a&gt; and a thicker &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate gyrus&lt;/a&gt;, where these neurons are found, even compared to much younger people. This part of the brain is involved in regulating attention, emotion, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; already noted that this part of the brain isn't shrinking as expected in superagers. Weintraub and team suspect superagers are born with a higher density of von Economo neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these differences seem to keep &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;superager brains quite stable&lt;/a&gt; compared to others over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SuperAgerTakesCognitiveTestInLab-e1760929809691.jpg" alt="Superager from study takes cognitive test." class="wp-image-178200 size-full"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A superager takes a cognitive test in the lab. (Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated superagers who were followed for decades," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University clinical neuropsychologist Tamar Gefen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also noted a list of genes highlighted by prior research that still could be investigated for further insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the genes that affect cognition as we age may allow us to create pharmaceuticals that promote superager brain settings and resistance to Alzheimer's disease, the researchers conclude in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70312"&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the technique being used here. In this case, the researchers placed the antibody genes in a circular loop of DNA called a plasmid. This is enough to ensure that the DNA doesn’t get digested immediately and to get the antibody genes made into proteins. But it does nothing to help get the DNA inside of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, a mixture of people from a biotech company and academic labs, used a commercial injection setup that mixes the injection of the DNA with short pulses of electricity. The electricity disrupts the cell membrane, allowing the plasmid DNA to make it inside cells. Based on animal testing, doing this in muscle cells is enough to turn the muscles into factories producing lots of broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study was meant to test the safety of doing that in humans. The team recruited 44 participants, testing various doses of two antibody-producing plasmids and injection schedules. All but four of the subjects completed the study; three of those who dropped out had all been testing a routine with the electric pulses happening very quickly, which turned out to be unpleasant. Fortunately, it didn’t seem to make any difference to the production of antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were a lot of adverse reactions, most of these were associated with the injection itself: muscle pain at the site, a scab forming afterward, and a reddening of the skin. The worst problem appeared to be a single case of moderate muscle pain that persisted for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all but one volunteer, the injection resulted in stable production of the two antibodies for at least 72 weeks following the injection; the single exception only made one of the two. That’s “at least” 72 weeks because that’s when they stopped testing—there was no indication that levels were dropping at this point. Injecting more DNA led to more variability in the amount of antibody produced, but that amount quickly maxed out. More total injections also boosted the level of antibody production. But even the minimal procedure—two injections of the lowest concentration tested—resulted in significant and stable antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

But when they marched on Russia, French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's &lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Grande Armee&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt; was doomed to failure and death, and not just on the battlefield.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;, a French research team has uncovered two new culprits that contributed to the annihilation of the 500,000-strong army during the 1812 Russian campaign.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;killers? Two species of bacteria, responsible for causing fever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;It's&lt;/span&gt; a surprise finding by a French research paleogenomic group led by scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Typhus and &lt;/span&gt;trench fever were previously established as &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; that tore through the ranks of Napoleon's army during the 1812 retreat. The newly uncovered infections cause different diseases with similar symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"Even &lt;/span&gt;today, it would be nearly impossible to make a differential diagnosis between these [fever] symptoms with the different pathogens," said Nicolas Rascovan, a paleogenomicist from the Pasteur Institute, who led the study. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;It would be impossible for a doctor to tell you which pathogen is infecting you." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;First &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;retreat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Seeking&lt;/span&gt; to force Russian Tsar Alexander I to comply with his trade embargo against Britain, &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/napoleon-bonaparte/t-74485669"&gt;Napoleon&lt;/a&gt; led the largest army Europe had ever seen across Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus before marching on Russia.  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;the summer of 1812, his forces successfully captured Moscow. From there, they fell into a stalemate with those of the Tsar, who refused to negotiate.  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Laden &lt;/span&gt;with treasure, and Napoleon himself having already departed for Paris, the Grande Armee delayed its withdrawal until October 17.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;It&lt;/span&gt; was then that a new threat advanced. Rather than Russian soldiers, the Grande Armee &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;had&lt;/span&gt; to contend with the triple threat of the advancing Russian winter, diminishing rations and disease. Barely 30,000 soldiers, around 6% of the original force, are recorded as having survived the withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;As &lt;/span&gt;well as starvation and the freezing weather, typhus — a common infection among army camps of the era — was thought to be one the deadliest hazards that haunted the Grande Armee&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt;, in 2002, excavators unearthed the bodies of hundreds of Napoleon's soldiers in Vilnius, the&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lithuania/t-66036518"&gt;Lithuanian&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;capital&lt;/span&gt;, one of the army's key stopping points. A 2006 analysis of some of these bodies found genetic evidence for &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/span&gt; prowazeki&lt;/em&gt;i&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;the bacteria that causes the expected typhus, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Artonella&lt;/span&gt; quintana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;which causes trench fever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;But a &lt;/span&gt;new analysis of 13 different bodies from the Vilnius mass grave has uncovered new killers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="74485829" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/74485829_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A man reviews an archeological site of skeletons in a mass grave"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The mass grave at Vilnius was the burial site for hundreds of troops from Napoleon's Grand Army&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Michel Signoli UMR 6578 - CNRS, Aix-Marseille Université, EFS&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Rascovan's&lt;/span&gt; team went searching for typhus and trench fever, but found two different diseases instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt; modern techniques for analyzing ancient DNA, the researchers found genetic remains of the paratyphoid-causing &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Salmonella enterica &lt;/span&gt;enterica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;bacteria&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Borrelia &lt;/span&gt;recurrentis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; cause of relapsing fever&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;four diseases identified in the remains of Napoleon's troops all carry similar symptoms associated with fevers, such as muscle aches and fatigue. To army medics in 1812, they would appear to be the same affliction. When combined with food shortages, freezing conditions and the fatigue of battle, these fevers would have made survival almost impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Rascovan&lt;/span&gt; expects more deadly diseases could still be discovered among the dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;Ancient DNA has moved forward as a field [since 2006], has expanded enormously," Rascovan told DW. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;We can, today, 200 years after, do a diagnosis and find all the different pathogens that were potentially present." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Paleogenomic&lt;/span&gt; scientists analyze ancient remains for genetic markers. The findings can often be surprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Earlier&lt;/span&gt; this year, Rascovan's team found that a&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/secret-leprosy-infected-the-americas-before-european-arrival/a-72789502"&gt;type of leprosy was already circulating in the Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt; prior&lt;/span&gt; to the first European arrivals in 1492. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;discipline has also been used to chart the movement of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/from-the-plague-to-covid-how-epidemics-shaped-history/a-59360351"&gt;bubonic plague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt; out &lt;/span&gt;of Central Asia during the Bronze Age. And researchers have tracked the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/homo-sapiens-made-it-to-northern-europe-45000-years-ago/a-68142867"&gt;movement of human groups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt; around&lt;/span&gt; the world as well as how they &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/neanderthals-live-on-in-modern-man/a-5551290"&gt;interbred with each other&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;It's&lt;/span&gt; even been used to shed light on &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/beethoven-locks-of-hair-give-new-clues-on-composers-health/a-65085634"&gt;the illnesses that plagued German composer Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Historians&lt;/span&gt; are excited about the possibilities of using DNA analysis to improve understanding of major events in recent centuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"Not &lt;/span&gt;only because it makes our historical knowledge a little bit more precise, but it also gives us an insight into different kinds of social conditions," said Erica Charters, a historian of war and disease based at Oxford University in the UK.  &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Charters, &lt;/span&gt;who was not involved in Rascovan's study, said the scale of Napoleon's conquests by 1812 would enable disease to move easily across Europe—not just because of the movement of his soldiers, but also due to trade among the French Empire and its neighboring alliances. One of the bacteria uncovered by Rascovan's team was even found to have English origins. Given Britain was Napoleon's primary enemy, and separated from France by an ocean, it shows how mobile diseases could be in times of major conflict. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"The &lt;/span&gt;retreat from Russia for the French Army is astounding," Charters told DW. "They're losing 95% of their forces from deaths and there's very few battles." &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="74485807" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/74485807_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Hands wearing white latex gloves handle an old tooth."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;One of the teeth analyzed identified genetic remains of bacteria that cause paratyphoid and relapsing fever. &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Claudio Centonze/Commission européenne&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;Disease and war &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;come&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2"&gt;together&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;From&lt;/span&gt; a historical perspective, these kinds of numbers are somewhat unusual, Charters said. But high rates of disease, and death from disease, are not at all unusual during wartime. &lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;The breakdown &lt;/span&gt;of civil infrastructure and the loss of food supplies for communities and militaries increase outbreaks of disease, she added.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;We actually see a lot of epidemics rising when there's an outbreak of war," she said, "These tend to be phenomena that break out together." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; points to an outbreak of syphilis in Europe amid conflicts in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the spread of influenza following World War I.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;Understanding &lt;/span&gt;how diseases spread during war can also give an insight into the risks associated with modern conflicts: sanitation, not simply advances in medicine, is a critical factor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span xml:lang="DE-DE"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;If you look around today and you look to see where epidemics may be happening, it's very often because there's been conflict which has broken down water supplies, Charters said, "which means that sanitation is gone and now means you have outbreaks." &lt;/p&gt;

Using comparative genomic analysis and a model they developed to infer the host origin of each isolate, they found that 18% of the UTIs were linked to ExPEC strains that came from the meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also discovered that UTIs in patients from high-poverty neighborhoods were 60% more likely to be caused by these zoonotic (animal-to-human) ExPEC strains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published yesterday in the journal &lt;em&gt;mBio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the contribution of zoonotic ExPEC to the UTI burden in Southern California and the need for targeted interventions to reduce risk in vulnerable communities," the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An underappreciated cause of UTIs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings build on research that Lance Price, PhD, founding director of George Washington University's Antibiotic Resistance Action Center, and his colleagues have been conducting for more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/analysis-ties-resistant-e-coli-poultry-meat-human-utis"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2018, they found that a strain of &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; that has caused serious UTIs around the world was prevalent in chicken and turkey meat. Then, in a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000381"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 that used similar methods to the current study, they found that 8% of &lt;em&gt;E coli &lt;/em&gt;isolates from human UTIs in Flagstaff, Arizona, were linked to retail meat sold in local stores and likely originated from food-producing animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was surprising that it was more than twice as high," Price told CIDRAP News, referring to the new results. "And that led us to try to figure out why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foodborne &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is generally associated with gastrointestinal illness and certain diarrhea-causing strains, such as Shiga toxin–producing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are tracked by industry and US health officials to make sure they are not contaminating the food supply and posing a risk to people. But the research Price and his colleagues have been conducting suggests that foodborne ExPEC strains that enter the urinary tract are an underappreciated cause of the 8 million UTIs diagnosed each year in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The kind that kills the most people are the extraintestinal pathogenic E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the kind that live in the gut with no symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although most UTIs are mild, they can progress to more serious invasive infections and sepsis if the infection gets into the bloodstream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When most people hear &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; they think about diarrhea and these dramatic foodborne outbreaks," he said. "But the kind that kills the most people are the extraintestinal pathogenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the kind that live in the gut with no symptoms. If it gets in the urinary tract, it has these special features that allow it to cause disease."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;18% of &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; came from food animals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine the percentage of UTIs in Southern California that could be attributed to zoonotic ExPEC strains, the research team—which also included scientists from the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Johns Hopkins University, and Statens Serum Institut—performed whole-genome sequencing on 2,349 human clinical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates collected from KPSC regional labs from February 2017 through May 2021. The patients were predominantly Hispanic (37.0%) and non-Hispanic White (31.7%) and resided in areas with low (42.2%) and medium family poverty rates (44.5%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investigators also sequenced 3,379 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates collected from retail samples of chicken, turkey, beef, and pork that were bought weekly from major grocery chains in the region. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;contamination was highest in turkey samples (82%), followed by chicken (58%), pork (54%), and beef (47%), and was higher in meat samples from stores in high poverty areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to comparing the core genomes of the human and foodborne &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates, the researchers were looking for the presence of 17 human- and animal-associated mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Their statistical model combines this information to help determine the origin of the isolate. If animal-associated MGEs are prevalent in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; collected from UTI samples, that's an indication the source was an animal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we see &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; in people that are carrying these chicken-adaptive mobile genetic elements, we can not only say that it came from chicken, but it probably came from chicken recently," Price explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The model estimated that 17.7% of the human clinical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; isolates originated from food-producing animals, primarily chickens and turkeys. The researchers also found that a subset of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; lineages, primarily those from poultry products, appeared to have "enhanced capacity" to cause zoonotic UTIs. Urine samples from women were significantly more likely to have zoonotic ExPEC strains than samples from men (19.7% vs 8.5%). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zoonotic strains less resistant to antibiotics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Notably, the zoonotic ExPEC strains were less likely than the non-zoonotic strains to be resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat UTIs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This finding, the authors say, may support the effectiveness of efforts by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to limit use of medically important antibiotics in livestock. Although the FDA has been criticized for not doing more, the authors note that, in countries where there is little regulation of antibiotic use in livestock, studies have found significantly higher levels of resistance to medically important antibiotics in bacteria spread from animals to people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rigorous antibiotic stewardship is needed in human and animal medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gail Hansen, DVM, a public health and veterinary consultant who was not involved in the study, said the link between human UTIs and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; from chickens and other food-producing animals is another reminder of why antibiotic stewardship is important.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Rigorous antibiotic stewardship is needed in human and animal medicine," Hansen said in an email. "We can't squander the precious resource of antibiotics anywhere."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Link between poverty rate, zoonotic &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what was even more surprising was that highest proportion of zoonotic ExPEC isolates (21.5%) was identified in patients from high-poverty areas. "After adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, individuals residing in a high-poverty area had a 1.6-fold increased risk of zoonotic ExPEC infections compared to those in low-poverty areas," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the factors underlying the correlate between the poverty rate and foodborne UTIs isn't entirely clear and needs further study, Price says he has some ideas. He notes that when he first began this line of research, he noticed that the chicken he bought from stores in poorer neighborhoods in Washington, DC, tended to be poorly packaged and "bloated with saline" that was likely contaminated with bacteria and could leak onto other groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they didn't compare retail meat packaging in stores from different neighborhoods in this study, Price says he would like to see if that could be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think that you could have the poorest-quality products in the poorest packaging being marketed in the poorest neighborhoods," he said. "It's a question worth investigating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, Price says recognizing meat as a potential source of exposure to zoonotic &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; could help reduce the burden of UTIs. One place to start would be for industry or regulatory agencies to start testing meat for other types of &lt;em&gt;E coli,&lt;/em&gt; and not just the toxigenic strains that cause gastrointestinal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almost every piece of chicken or ground turkey I test has &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; in it," he said. "We should be doing more to decrease contamination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you open that package, just assume you've splattered some bacteria in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until that happens, he added, consumers should follow safe food-handling procedures, including thorough cooking of meat, washing hands and surfaces, and avoiding cross-contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you open that package, just assume you've splattered some bacteria in your kitchen; assume every piece of meat is contaminated, and handle it that way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Summer Bushman, from Salem, Virginia, lost her 10-year-old daughter Autumn to suicide earlier this year after months of bullying, both in person and online. In an interview with CBS News, she revealed that Autumn often used her phone in bed at night, a habit she now believes played a devastating role in her death. “She was looking at her phone just before it happened,” Summer said. “I wish I had never let her keep it in her room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A vibrant child silenced by screens and bullying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn was, by all accounts, a bright and joyful child, a fourth-grade cheerleader who filled her home with music and dance. “She turned my living room into a stage,” her mother recalled. But behind her bubbly exterior, Autumn was struggling with relentless teasing about her braces and appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many children today, she sought connection through her phone, the same device that became a portal for cyberbullying. Late-night messages and social media comments compounded the hurt. What once might have ended at the school gates now followed her home, glowing quietly from her pillow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists call this the “24-hour schoolyard”, the digital extension of peer pressure and cruelty that leaves children little space to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A tragic night and a painful awakening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 21, Autumn took her own life in her bedroom. When her mother found her, the phone’s screen was still on. “She used to say she needed her alarm,” Summer said softly. “And every morning when I went to wake her, the alarm was ringing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tragedy reflects a troubling pattern seen across the world. In the United States alone, youth suicide rates have risen by over 50% in the past decade, with growing evidence linking social media use, especially at night, to depression and self-harm. A 2019 Lancet Psychiatry study found that adolescents spending more than three hours a day on social media were twice as likely to report mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind sleep and screens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night phone use does more than expose children to online harm; it directly affects their mental and physical health. Screens emit blue light, which suppresses the hormone melatonin, disrupting natural sleep cycles. Sleep deprivation, in turn, intensifies anxiety, impulsivity, and depression, all factors linked to suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Virginia Tech study reinforced this connection. Researchers found that nearly 75% of adolescents who attempted suicide were using screens shortly before and that most incidents occurred after 8 p.m. “It’s pretty dangerous for bullied children to have their phones at night,” lead researcher Dr. Abhishek Reddy noted. “During the day, they have access to support, counsellors, teachers, parents. At night, that access disappears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A mother’s call for digital boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Summer, her daughter’s loss has become a mission. She now advocates for parents to remove phones from bedrooms, restrict nighttime use, and encourage healthier sleep routines. “If I could go back, I’d take that phone away,” she said. “She deserved to live a long, happy life. Now, I’ll never see her go to prom, get married, or chase her dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her message echoes growing calls among educators and child psychologists to delay smartphone access for young children altogether.

The Russians retreated but burned the countryside as they withdrew, using scorched-earth tactics that eventually left Napoleon’s troops occupying a ruined Moscow. By fall, his ill-fated troops began to leave for encampments along the Russian border, where an estimated 300,000 of them were eventually mowed down not by military might, but by illness coupled with extreme cold, starvation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 18:19:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNZ2dZVnpoWFFRdjg5QTZQRFdKREhfelRUU3ZpNHp0dFZoaW1Rb2NuaFFWRzBiMWdjZnV5dkZGZ041Yk9RV3hmcjE5QWpDeG10Y3ZqVnhfYVY2R2RJako4eVNvdkplSkk2UVZudG94OGtWQVNjVF9BY1BVRko1ckJIYk90UTI0WjR3Y25hS0VWb1B6VDRFQUhB</guid></item><item><title>哈佛顶尖医生分享如何将咖啡转化为抗炎强国的技巧-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/top-harvard-doctor-on-how-to-convert-coffee-into-anti-inflammatory-powerhouse/photostory/124790730.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a study titled &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5696634/"&gt;Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, it has been found that coffee consumption is more often associated with benefit than harm for a range of health outcomes across exposures including high versus low, any versus none, and one extra cup a day. Consumption was also associated with a lower risk of several specific cancers and neurological, metabolic, and liver conditions. There was evidence of a non-linear association between consumption and some outcomes, with summary estimates indicating largest relative risk reduction at intakes of three to four cups a day versus none, including all cause mortality (relative risk 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.88), cardiovascular mortality (0.81, 0.72 to 0.90), and cardiovascular disease (0.85, 0.80 to 0.90). High versus low consumption was associated with an 18% lower risk of incident cancer (0.82, 0.74 to 0.89). The study concluded that coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating the largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 17:23:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>UTI可能来自您的购物车- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/utis-might-be-coming-from-your-grocery-cart-2000676662</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here’s something to unnerve you during your next trip to the supermarket. Research out this week shows that a substantial portion of urinary tract infections can be traced back to store-bought meat tainted with dangerous &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at George Washington University and others examined thousands of samples taken from people with UTIs. They found that roughly one in five infections were likely caused by foodborne strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The results suggest that contaminated meat is an underappreciated source of these often miserable infections, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight zoonotic transmission as an important driver of UTIs,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The origins of a UTI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;UTIs are one of the most common infections around, and they’re &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/230/5/e1101/7701247"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to result in 3 million visits to the emergency room in the U.S. alone every year. Over 80% of UTIs are &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection#:~:text=Bacteria%20that%20cause%20UTIs%20include,found%20in%20feces%20(stool)."&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. These bacteria are found most everywhere, including the guts of people and many of the animals that we regularly eat, though only some strains can make us sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The George Washington University researchers have been investigating the possibility of foodborne UTIs for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, for instance, they &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/store-bought-chicken-could-be-causing-urinary-tract-inf-1828652990"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing clear evidence of human UTIs caused by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria first found in store-bought meat, especially chicken. But the researchers say it’s still been unclear just how often UTIs are likely to originate from food, particularly in major metropolitan areas. To help answer this, they teamed up with other researchers at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Together, they collected a large amount of &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;samples from both real-life UTI patients in Southern California and packages of retail meat, ultimately sequencing the genetics of over 5,000 samples. They then developed an algorithm, based on 17 specific genetic markers, to identify whether a particular sample of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; originally came from animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All told, they found that 18% of human UTI infections diagnosed in the region between 2017 and 2023 were probably zoonotic in origin—foodborne, in other words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hidden meat risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their findings are limited to a single, if large, region. So more studies should be done to quantify the extent of this issue in other parts of the country. But given their earlier research, it certainly seems likely that tainted meat plays a significant and underrecognized role in UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem,” said senior study author Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, in a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current findings might also help inform prevention efforts moving forward. The most dangerous foodborne UTI strains tended to come from chicken and turkey, for instance. And people living in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to have foodborne UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the same tips used to prevent foodborne illness in general should also lower your risk of these UTIs. That includes buying meat that’s securely sealed and won’t leak onto your other groceries, thoroughly cooking your meat, and washing your hands after handling raw food.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

I was prepared to answer awkward questions, provide condoms and buy Plan B like a good parent, because abstinence-only sex ed is how you end up with teen pregnancy and STDs. But I wasn’t prepared to need to cover burner phones, passports, and abortion bounty hunters! “It’s important to practice safe sex, but if you think you might be pregnant, don’t Google, pay cash for your pregnancy test, and certainly don’t tell your boyfriend because if you decide to go to Mexico to terminate, Border Patrol can search your phone and jail you and your boyfriend can turn you in for a $10,000 reward.” I’d like to think my girls are smart enough to conclude on their own that safe sex isn’t all that safe anymore, but hormones and developing brains don’t always make the best decisions. Do you have any tips for navigating this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

If you live in a place where abortion is illegal or severely restricted, then yes, make sure they know not to text about an unwanted pregnancy or to Google ways to terminate; you should also tell them to make sure they can fully trust their partner not to report them before sharing the news. Do your own research on where the nearest state is that provides abortions and how to go about securing care if the need arises. Make sure that your daughters know that sex always carries a risk, but that it is heightened where they live and encourage them to consider that when deciding what to do and where to go after high school. Make condoms available to them and tell them that if they wish to be sexually active, you’ll take them to get on birth control (if, hopefully, it remains available.) Acknowledge that talking to your mother about sex can be absolutely cringe-inducing, but that it would be better to endure some awkward chats than to find themselves in a difficult situation that could be avoided. Encourage them to wait until they are absolutely sure that they are ready to have sex and to only do so with a person who they can trust. Talk to them candidly about how boys often use girls for sex, or go tell others that they’ve been intimate with them. Tell them about the double standards for girls and boys and that while they shouldn’t determine what they choose to do, they may be penalized for simply honoring their desires. Make sure they are aware of what the major sexually transmitted infections are and how to obtain treatment. These are scary times indeed, but the more you share with your girls, the better prepared they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Viruses are tiny — and sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So sneaky that some play a deadly game of hide and seek. The "seek" part is all too familiar: They're always looking for ways to infect humans. Their ability to hide is far less well-known and can have devastating implications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The human body holds several effective hiding spots that some of the world's nastiest viruses have discovered — like the eyes and the testes — that are beyond the reach of the immune system. It's here that submicroscopic viral RNA can safely linger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often the human hosts have no idea. They'd fallen ill, then appeared to beat the virus. Their blood tested negative. They show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that hidden virus is capable of springing back into action. It can emerge from hiding — either sickening the original host or slipping into semen or breast milk and infecting someone new.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Which viruses have mastered this technique? A number of notorious ones from Zika to measles to highly deadly viruses like Nipah, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/10/06/g-s1-91435/virus-marburg-deadly-disease-rwanda" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marburg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Lassa fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the virus that terrified the world in 2014: Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the decade since, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced more than its fair share of Ebola crises — with nine outbreaks, including one that is ongoing — and more than its fair share of hidden viruses that spring back into action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Almost all the outbreaks recently — maybe not every single one of them but the vast majority — are traced back to a previous outbreak," says Dr. Elizabeth Higgs, who is with the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She says once the genetics of the virus are sequenced it is clear that many of the outbreaks haven't come from an animal — like a bat — but from a human who unwittingly carried the virus after surviving a previous outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most survivors will never start a new outbreak, it is happening enough that Higgs says, "I think it's top of the research agenda."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Everybody was panicking"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Soka Moses first grasped the significance of these virus hideouts a decade ago. It was in mid-March 2015 when people in his West African country of Liberia were heaving a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The country was emerging from a nightmare, recalls Moses, then the medical director at an Ebola treatment center. Nearly 5,000 people died over the previous year. Some perished in the streets, unable to find a hospital bed. Schools shuttered, markets closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, in early March of 2015, there were no more Ebola cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the crisis was not over.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Liberia had reached zero cases, Moses recalls sitting in a daily meeting led by Liberia's National Epidemic Response Team when "boom! A case was identified." As word got out, he says: "Everybody was panicking: 'Oh, my God. Are we starting this again?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the panic was the mystery. How could this woman have contracted Ebola when there were no active cases? The virus spreads easily when someone comes into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, even sweat or saliva, but it was not clear where or how this new patient could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Family members eventually pointed medical investigators to the woman's sexual partner. Five months ago he'd recovered from Ebola. "[He'd] tested negative on two different occasions," says Moses. "[He was] doing perfectly fine, no symptoms whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The man was terrified and, initially, avoided the authorities. "He thought he was in really big trouble," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once he was reassured that he was not in trouble, he agreed to cooperate. The challenge for scientists: Find out if the virus was hiding somewhere in his body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They ultimately determined that the Ebola virus was no longer in his blood … but lived on in his testes and had been transmitted in his semen.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So that was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18584" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first documented sexually transmitted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case of Ebola virus disease," says Moses. While he'd read about a 1967 case in which another virus hid out in the body, the implications were now much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This prompted Moses to act. He's now the director of PREVAIL or the Partnership for Research on Vaccines &amp;amp; Infectious Diseases in Liberia, which studies the phenomenon of hidden viruses, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The body's sanctuary sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a number of spots where the viruses can hide — not only eyes and testes but also the brain, the placenta and vaginal fluids as well as the mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We call them sanctuary sites," says &lt;a href="https://www.usna.edu/NASEC/_files/documents/2023/CAPT_Joel_Montgomery.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joel Montgomery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the virus, these are havens protected from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists think this is likely because these body parts are critical for survival — and vulnerable to damage if the immune system overreacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, "in the process of making eggs and sperm, we mix and match the genes. So they're not really us anymore," says &lt;a href="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/pediatrics-medicine-infectious-diseases-debakey-pediatrics-med-peds-tips-mentor/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. That means the immune system might see eggs or sperm as foreign invaders and try to attack them, so it's helpful if those parts of the body are outside the reach of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The brain has a special level of protection&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the blood brain barrier which limits the entry of immune cells. As for the eye? "An eye doctor might scold me for this, but to me, it's really an extension of the brain. There's a large nerve that goes from your eye directly into your brain," Schieffelin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many mysteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's still a lot scientists don't know about how viruses behave in these sanctuary sites.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, exactly how long can a virus stay there? In many cases where individuals were tested, it appears to be a matter of months. In some cases, it's years. There have even been semen samples that test negative for the virus at one point then return to positive later. It's not clear to scientists what prompted this reversal. And researchers haven't followed enough people who've harbored one of these infections long enough to know the outer limit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another big unknown: What is the virus doing in the sanctuary site? It seems as if it's almost dormant, barely replicating. "But we don't know why someone relapses. We don't know if it's a drop in their immune system or if there's some other factor," says Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear and stigma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montgomery says the goal is to identify medications for survivors that can reach into sanctuary sites and root out any hidden virus. For this, he says, the size of the molecule in the drug is key.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really need to explore the use of small-molecule drugs," he says, suggesting the smaller the drug's molecule the more likely it can penetrate the protective barrier around a sanctuary site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moses' team has been studying exactly this with the drug remdesivir — and results have been promising. Survivors who got the drug cleared the virus from their semen more quickly than survivors who got the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many of the researchers are focused on the biology, something that's never far from their mind is the psychological part of the equation. Ebola survivors can face intense fear and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Dehkontee Dennis — who works at PREVAIL in Liberia — was enrolling for the study, she says she noticed "there was one thing that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these men have expressed: They have this fear. They don't want to transmit the virus to their families. They want to have children. They want to stop using condoms [to prevent transmission]."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The flip side of their fear is that many of the community members — who may have lost their partners and other family members to Ebola — fear the survivors may still pose a threat, even if they don't know about sanctuary sites. "Community members did not even want them back in the communities," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This level of stigma makes it tricky to talk about the risk that the virus could hide in a survivor and then resurface. Survivors and their community need to know there's a chance this could happen, the scientists say — but only in a small percentage of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reassurance can also come from survivor programs that test semen and vaccination campaigns to protect the community. But scientists say the solution will be finding medications that can ferret out these hidden, potentially lethal viruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's great that we have vaccines," says Joel Montgomery of the CDC. "It's great that we have therapeutics. It's great that we're saving people's lives. But now we need to figure out a way to make sure the virus is completely eliminated from them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
