            For people with chronic gynecological pain conditions, pain can be constant, making everyday activities like sitting, riding a bicycle and even wearing underwear extremely uncomfortable. For many of these people — most of whom identify as women — sexual intercourse and routine pelvic exams are unbearable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

They each affect about 1 in 10 American women.

            Yet many women face skepticism and gaslighting in health care settings when they seek care for this type of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            We’ve consistently found that medical gaslighting around chronic gynecological pain is a complex societal problem, fueled by holes in medical research and training.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00063j6n3ho0bnjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2024 study of patients who went to a clinic for vulvovaginal pain — pain experienced in the external female genitals and vagina –- found that 45% of these patients had been told that they “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdae054.081" target="_blank"&gt;just needed to relax more&lt;/a&gt;” and 39% were made to feel that they were “crazy.” A staggering 55% had considered giving up on seeking care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00073j6nzhwytske@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These results echo what one of us — Elizabeth Hintz — found in her 2023 meta-synthesis: Female patients with chronic pain conditions frequently hear this “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2081046" target="_blank"&gt;it’s all in your head&lt;/a&gt;” response from doctors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00083j6n4n0c4ntt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another study followed patients in two different major US cities who were seeking care for vulvovaginal pain. The researchers found that most patients saw multiple clinicians but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2013.09.033" target="_blank"&gt;never received a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. Given the challenges of seeking medical care, many patients turn to social &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/63072" target="_blank"&gt;media sources like Reddit for support and information&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo00093j6nctn1df3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These studies, among others, illustrate how people with these conditions often spend years going to clinician after clinician seeking care and being told their pain is psychological or perhaps not even real. Given these experiences, why do patients keep seeking care?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000a3j6nzbt08uc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Let me describe the pain that would drive me to try so many different doctors, tests and treatments,” &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsm.12167" target="_blank"&gt;a patient with vulvovaginal pain&lt;/a&gt; said to her doctor. For her, sex “is like taking your most sensitive area and trying to rip it apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000b3j6nzfjjasdm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can now wear any pants or underwear that I want with no pain,” said another patient after successful treatment. “I never realized how much of a toll the pain took on my body every day until it was gone.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000c3j6nb9qmbs94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2024.06.022" target="_blank"&gt;patients worldwide experience medical gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146510383495" target="_blank"&gt;a social phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; where a patient’s health concerns are not given appropriate medical evaluation and are instead downplayed, misattributed or dismissed outright.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000d3j6nt9lti3gb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical gaslighting is rooted in centuries of gender bias in medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000e3j6netme1bkm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women’s reproductive health issues have long been dismissed as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jahist/jaad001" target="_blank"&gt;psychological or “hysterical.”&lt;/a&gt; Genital and pelvic pain especially has been misattributed to psychological rather than biological causes: A century ago, Freudian psychoanalysts incorrectly believed that female sexual pain came from psychological complexes like penis envy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000f3j6n3bcf24oj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These historical views help shed light on why these symptoms are still not taken seriously today.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000g3j6nrgtqna5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to the physical toll of untreated pain, medical gaslighting can take &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmn.2010.09.001" target="_blank"&gt;a psychological toll&lt;/a&gt;. Women may become &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hcr/hqad004" target="_blank"&gt;isolated when other people do not believe their pain&lt;/a&gt;. Some internalize this disbelief and can begin to doubt their own perceptions of pain and even their sanity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000h3j6nivpuxwbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This cycle of gaslighting compounds the burden of the pain and might lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.52053/jpap.v5i1.249" target="_blank"&gt;long-term psychological effects&lt;/a&gt; like anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. For some, the repeated experience of being dismissed by clinicians &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2025.108701" target="_blank"&gt;erodes their sense of trust&lt;/a&gt; in the health care system. They might hesitate to seek medical attention in the future, fearing they will once again be dismissed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000i3j6nt9sthou3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although some chronic gynecological pain conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.endofound.org/" target="_blank"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/doing-harm-maya-dusenbery?variant=41000001798178" target="_blank"&gt;gaining public attention&lt;/a&gt; and becoming better understood, these dynamics persist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000j3j6n9i0nxx2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Part of the reason for the misunderstanding surrounding chronic gynecological pain conditions is the lack of research on them. A January report from the National Academies found that research on &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28586/a-new-vision-for-womens-health-research-transformative-change-at" target="_blank"&gt;diseases disproportionately affecting women were underfunded&lt;/a&gt; compared with diseases disproportionately affecting men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000k3j6nvkaycwom@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This problem has gotten worse over time. The proportion of funding from the National Institutes of Health spent on women’s health has actually &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28586/a-new-vision-for-womens-health-research-transformative-change-at" target="_blank"&gt;declined over the past decade&lt;/a&gt;. Despite these known disparities, in April the Trump administration threatened to end funding for the Women’s Health Initiative, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-womens-health-initiative-has-shaped-womens-health-for-over-30-years-but-its-future-is-uncertain-255311" target="_blank"&gt;a long-running women’s health research program&lt;/a&gt;, further worsening the problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            Without sustained federal funding for women’s health research, conditions like endometriosis and vulvodynia will remain poorly understood, leaving clinicians in the dark and patients stranded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000m3j6no8nvvedv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as it is for any female patient to have their pain believed and treated, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.048" target="_blank"&gt;gaining recognition for chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; is even harder for those who face discrimination based on class or race.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000n3j6nxk1ifsg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One 2016 study found that half of the white medical students surveyed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1516047113" target="_blank"&gt;endorsed at least one false belief&lt;/a&gt; about biological differences between Black and white patients, such as that Black people have physically thicker skin or less sensitive nerve endings than white people. The medical students and residents who endorsed these false beliefs also underestimated Black patients’ pain and offered them less accurate treatment recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000o3j6n4583k92s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.01.005" target="_blank"&gt;women are more likely to develop chronic pain conditions&lt;/a&gt; and report &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102558" target="_blank"&gt;more frequent and severe pain&lt;/a&gt; than men. But women are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000536" target="_blank"&gt;perceived as more emotional&lt;/a&gt; and thus less reliable in describing their pain than men. Consequently, female patients who describe the same symptoms as male patients are judged to be in less pain and are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5465/AMPROC.2024.12304abstract" target="_blank"&gt;less likely to be offered pain relief&lt;/a&gt;, even in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2401331121" target="_blank"&gt;emergency settings and with female clinicians&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to male patients, female patients are more likely to be prescribed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2021.03.001" target="_blank"&gt;psychological care instead of pain medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000p3j6nldblourr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These lingering erroneous beliefs about gender and race are key reasons patients’ pain is dismissed, misunderstood and ignored. The very real-life consequences for patients include delayed diagnosis, treatment and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Correcting these problems will require a shift in clinical training, so as to challenge biased views about pain in women and racial minorities and to educate clinicians about common pain conditions like vulvodynia. Research suggests that medical training needs to teach students to better listen to patients’ lived experiences and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735241252475" target="_blank"&gt;admit when an answer isn’t known&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the meantime, people navigating the health care system can take practical steps when encountering dismissive care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000s3j6nqxh6ah7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They can educate themselves about chronic gynecological pain conditions by reading books like “&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/andrew-goldstein-md/when-sex-hurts/9780306827419/?lens=balance" target="_blank"&gt;When Sex Hurts: Understanding and Healing Pelvic Pain&lt;/a&gt;” or educational information from trusted sources like the &lt;a href="https://www.prosayla.com/" target="_blank"&gt;International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.pelvicpain.org/public/resources/educational-resources/informational-handouts" target="_blank"&gt;International Pelvic Pain Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.issvd.org/publications/patient-handouts" target="_blank"&gt;International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease&lt;/a&gt;.

            Although these steps do not address the roots of medical gaslighting, they can empower patients to better understand the medical conditions that could cause their symptoms, helping to counteract the effects of gaslighting.

Additionally, connecting with patient advocacy groups like &lt;a href="https://www.tightlipped.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tight Lipped&lt;/a&gt; can provide opportunities for patients to engage in changing the health care system.

Most cases go away on their own with no permanent damage, but it could take up to six months for symptoms to disappear entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for the condition other than antibody therapy and vaccines within two weeks of exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Sax, clinical director of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/hepatitis-a-provincetown-outbreak-massachusetts/"&gt;local news&lt;/a&gt;: 'It's not the kind of illness like a typical food poisoning where you're sick for one or two days, then you're back to normal within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Usually, people with hepatitis A, at least the people who get diagnosed, are out for two to three weeks, sometimes longer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In extremely rare cases - one in 5million people - the infection can be fatal due to severe liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Massachusetts health officials urged people who may have been exposed to get vaccinated within two weeks, as the first dose is only effective for that period. A second dose six months later provides protection for several years and is 94 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sax said: 'It makes sense for people to get vaccinated for hepatitis A. Our hepatitis A vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines that we have.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using transparent zebrafish, scientists observed that these immune cells contain internal circadian clocks that are activated by light, boosting their bacterial-killing ability during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This synchronization between daylight and immune response suggests an evolutionary adaptation to better defend against infections encountered during periods of activity. The findings could lead to new therapies that optimize immune function by targeting these cellular clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutrophil Clocks:&lt;/strong&gt; Neutrophils possess circadian clocks that respond to daylight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peak Immunity Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; Immune responses are stronger during daytime activity phases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting neutrophil clocks may enhance treatment for infections and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A breakthrough study, led by scientists at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland, has uncovered how daylight can boost the immune system’s ability to fight infections.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on the most abundant immune cells in our bodies, called ‘neutrophils’, which are a type of white blood cell. These cells move quickly to the site of an infection and kill invading bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used zebrafish, a small freshwater fish, as a model organism, because its genetic make-up is similar to ours and they can be bred to have transparent bodies, making it easy to observe biological processes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In earlier studies, we had observed that immune responses peaked in the morning, during the fish’s early active phase,” says lead researcher Associate Professor Christopher Hall, from the Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this represents an evolutionary response such that during daylight hours the host is more active so more likely to encounter bacterial infections,” says Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the scientists wanted to find out how the immune response was being synchronised with daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, and led by two doctoral researchers, neutrophils were found to possess a circadian clock that alerted them to daytime, and boosted their ability to kill bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of our cells have circadian clocks to tell them what time of day it is in the outside world, in order to regulate the body’s activities. Light has the biggest influence on resetting these circadian clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that neutrophils are the first immune cells to be recruited to sites of inflammation, our discovery has very broad implications for therapeutic benefit in many inflammatory diseases,” Hall says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding paves the way for development of drugs that target the circadian clock in neutrophils to boost their ability to fight infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded through the Royal Society of NZ’s Marsden Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research is now focussed on understanding the specific mechanisms by which light influences the neutrophil circadian clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this circadian rhythm and immune system research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#197e70757b7c6b6d376e76777e59786c7a727578777d37787a377763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gilbert Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://auckland.ac.nz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gilbert Wong – University of Auckland&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adn3080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A light-regulated circadian timer optimizes neutrophil bactericidal activity to boost daytime immunity&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher Hall et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A light-regulated circadian timer optimizes neutrophil bactericidal activity to boost daytime immunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune response exhibits strong circadian rhythmicity, with enhanced bacterial clearance often synchronized with an organism’s active phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite providing the bulk of cellular antibacterial defense, the neutrophil clockwork is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we used larval zebrafish to explore the role of clock genes in neutrophils during infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per2&lt;/em&gt; was required in neutrophils for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and bacterial killing by enhancing infection-responsive expression of &lt;em&gt;high-mobility group box 1a&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cry binding domain of Per2 was required for regulation of neutrophil bactericidal activity, and neutrophils lacking Cry1a had elevated bactericidal activity and infection-responsive &lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt; expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conserved cis-regulatory element with BMAL1 and nuclear factor κB binding motifs gated infection-responsive &lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt; expression to the light phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutagenesis of the BMAL1 motif in neutrophils blunted the priming effect of light on bactericidal activity and &lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt; expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings identify a light-responsive cell-intrinsic timer that controls time-of-day variations in antibacterial activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 12:56:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9OZWd3cloxRzluSUNmSGhmV0xjU1ZNNUZnajJDVGxGcEJfWW56WVRjN3FHZTlpSXRnbmVRbGpiMmhSUDJYQ3VDemJqNm56eEk5UWMtVTdvMEtvNTVoLW4wQ2EtcThWa01Vbmc</guid></item><item><title>脑干神经元是Semaglutide减肥效果的关键-神经科学新闻 | Brainstem Neurons Hold Key to Semaglutide’s Weight Loss Effects - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE9kZ1pfYmZxQjRkYlllTklCMGYyVlR2bF9YQVdSNGZsZHhxQlNha2lVS0h6T3ZhdlZ6d0Q3bGdnLUxhallaMlZfYzNQTWtJRXlFYzhtOUprMTBYazZjWDY1bkdGcUtKSVlUOVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have identified a specific group of brainstem neurons that mediate the appetite-reducing and weight-loss effects of semaglutide without triggering side effects like nausea. In mice, activating these neurons led to reduced food intake and fat loss, mimicking the drug’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, disabling them diminished semaglutide’s effects on weight, but not its adverse symptoms. This discovery could lead to more targeted obesity treatments that preserve the benefits of GLP-1R agonists while minimizing discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; A specific set of neurons in the dorsal vagal complex mediate semaglutide’s appetite-suppressing effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Effect Separation:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons are not significantly involved in side effects like nausea or muscle loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting these neurons could enhance obesity treatments while reducing unwanted symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A specific group of nerve cells in the brain stem appears to control how semaglutide affects appetite and weight – without causing nausea. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, made at the University of Gothenburg, could pave the way for better drugs to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide belongs to a group of drugs called GLP-1R agonists and has been shown to effectively reduce food intake and body weight. The drug is already well established as part of the treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes, but can cause side effects such as nausea and muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110399"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When these nerve cells were killed, the drug’s effect on appetite and fat loss instead decreased significantly. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg have shown that it is possible to distinguish the nerve cells in the brain that control the beneficial effects – such as reduced food intake and fat loss – from those that contribute to side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activated nerve cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate how semaglutide affects the brain, the researchers worked with mice. They tracked which nerve cells were activated by the drug and were then able to stimulate these cells – without administering the drug itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was that the mice ate less and lost weight, just as they did when treated with semaglutide. When these nerve cells were killed, the drug’s effect on appetite and fat loss instead decreased significantly. However, side effects such as nausea and muscle loss remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that these nerve cells control the beneficial effects of semaglutide. We have therefore identified a specific group of nerve cells that is necessary for the effects that semaglutide has on weight and appetite, but which does not appear to contribute to any significant extent to side effects such as nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can target the treatment there, we may be able to maintain the positive effects while reducing side effects,” says Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu, first author of the study and PhD student at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identified nerve cells are located in an area of the brain called the dorsal vagal complex. For the researchers, the result is not only an early step toward potentially improved treatment, it also provides new knowledge about how semaglutide works in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also provides deeper insight into how the brain stem regulates our energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Semaglutide and other GLP-1R agonists are currently being prescribed to more and more people and are also being investigated for other potential indications such as substance use disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to understand how these drugs actually work. The better we understand this, the greater the opportunity we have to improve them,” says Linda Engström Ruud, researcher and supervisor to PhD students Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu and Sebastian Blid Sköldheden, who both worked on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this semaglutide and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu – University of Gothenburg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.04.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Semaglutide effects on energy balance are mediated by &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the dorsal vagal complex&lt;/a&gt;” by Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semaglutide effects on energy balance are mediated by &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the dorsal vagal complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of the GLP-1R agonist semaglutide is revolutionizing the treatment of obesity, yet its mechanistic effects on energy balance remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that reactivation of semaglutide-responsive dorsal vagal complex neurons mimics the drug’s effects of reducing food intake and body weight and promoting fat utilization and conditioned taste aversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe that many of the semaglutide-activated area postrema (AP) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) neurons express &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt; mRNA, and ablation of AP/NTS &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons largely reverses semaglutide’s effects on energy balance acutely in lean mice and in subchronically treated obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide-activated AP/NTS &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons promote the loss of fat rather than lean mass, with only a modest effect on conditioned taste aversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, NTS &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are engaged by GLP-1R-expressing AP neurons and are necessary for semaglutide-induced activation of several downstream satiety-related structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective targeting of semaglutide-responsive &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons holds potential for improved future anti-obesity treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old man says he transformed his body in a few months by switching to full-body workouts and smaller portion sizes with a protein goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon Doyle, a GP from London, had a consistent fitness routine until a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shoulder-hurt-when-lifting-arm-pain-overhead-press-when-stop-2022-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;shoulder injury&lt;/a&gt; left him out of the gym for more than a year, during which he started to feel out of shape and struggled to bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It happens gradually.

"I'm using my rest time to work different muscle groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6eb18315-0f92-4e1f-beb4-2715d18bf442" data-toc-id="6eb18315-0f92-4e1f-beb4-2715d18bf442"&gt;Increasing weight is key for muscle gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle said tracking his workouts boosted his progress by adding more weight to his lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His typical session involved three sets per exercise and no more than 12 reps per set. If he hit all 12 reps, he would increase the weight to make it more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/progressive-overload-fitness-meaning-and-how-to-do-it-2021-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt;, gradually putting more stress on your muscles, is a well-established fitness technique. That's what prompts muscles to build back bigger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Doyle said he would get stuck at a certain weight. Recently, Enaz helped him break through a plateau by increasing the weight on the first set, even if he couldn't lift heavier for all three, until he was able to adapt, Doyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really track that to make sure you're not plateauing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Skipping preventive care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/heather-elizabeth-whitson" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Heather Whitson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/heather-elizabeth-whitson" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Heather Whitson&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="https://agingcenter.duke.edu/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Duke Aging Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://agingcenter.duke.edu/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Duke Aging Center&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina, neglecting to stay up to date on preventive care — including things like mammograms, colonoscopies and vaccines — is not good for your long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like not taking your car into the shop,” Whitson said. “It’s probably not going to last as long if you don’t keep up with the routine maintenance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can chat with your primary care doctor about what preventive tests are right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not cultivating social relationships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that socialization helps with your brain and with your longevity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1346279213/lee-a-lindquist-md-mph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Lee Lindquist" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1346279213/lee-a-lindquist-md-mph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Lee Lindquist&lt;/a&gt;, chief of geriatrics at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The more time you spend interacting with other people, the more it can benefit your life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always joke... that you need to socialize with happy people, because we all have toxic people in our lives,” she said.

As you age, it’s normal for your social circle to dwindle, which means it’s critical to keep going out to meet new people if you want to age well, Lindquist noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not adjusting your medications as you age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see it so many times where people will be on medicines that they were started on in their 40s and 50s that they may not need in their 70s or 80s,” Lindquist said. “And some of these medicines are not ideal for older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain medications can make you more susceptible to falls and cause thinking problems, she added.

Not exercising.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one probably isn’t surprising, but it can’t be said enough: Failing to exercise will harm your longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is amazing — being able to put exercise in a pill form would take a lot of health care providers out of business, because it really is good for mood, it’s good for weight control, it’s good for your bones, it’s good for your heart, it’s good for your brain,” Whitson said. “And it really is about the only thing that you can recommend that has all-around good benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercising is super important, and not exercising or not getting enough daily activity is something that will definitely harm your longevity,” Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how much she recommends people exercise, Lindquist simply said: “More.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you get too comfortable, and doing the same activity three times a week, once a week, or even not at all, it just really hurts your body,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re someone who goes on a daily walk, try adding in a Zumba class a few times a week. If you’re a die-hard Peloton fan, sign up for some personal training classes, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you ask your physician for a physical therapy order to get you started to get you moving around more, that’s very important,” Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a benchmark to start, you should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week, according &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="to the American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;to the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;. And, again, more minutes mean more health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Smoking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Smoking cigarettes is linked" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Smoking cigarettes is linked&lt;/a&gt; to lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and more. But it’s highly addictive, making it hard to just quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/i-want-to-quit/how-to-quit-smoking" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Lung Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/i-want-to-quit/how-to-quit-smoking" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;, it can be helpful to zero in on the reason you’re quitting smoking, so you can use it as motivation through the tough parts of the process. You can also get resources from your doctor to help you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Staying social has proven longevity benefits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Eating an unhealthy diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Whitson, prioritizing a healthy diet is another way to better your chances of a healthy life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitson suggested that “a Mediterranean-style diet that is heavy on fish... and heavy on whole fruits and vegetables and grains, with only the very occasional treat of processed food, is probably the best thing for most people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to change your diet ― but you may have an easier time doing so when you’re younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very hard to change your diet when you’re in your 70s, 80s, 90s, so if you can start eating right earlier, it’s going to be easier for you and it’ll affect you better over the long run,” Lindquist explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Not getting enough sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of increasing evidence that depriving ourselves of sleep has long-term consequences,” Whitson said. These include &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a higher risk" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia and &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/happens-body-dont-get-enough-sleep" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="heart disease" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/happens-body-dont-get-enough-sleep" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="higher levels of daily stress" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;higher levels of daily stress&lt;/a&gt; and worse moods overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal to experience age-related changes that affect your sleep, so you shouldn’t be totally alarmed if your sleep patterns are different as you get older. But certain conditions, like obstructive sleep apnea, put you at risk for some of these negative outcomes when left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re... noticing really excessive daytime sleepiness, if their partner’s telling them that they’re snoring or having apneic episodes [where you stop breathing] that are waking them up at night,” it’s important to let a doctor know, Whitson noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/better-sleep-avoid-habits_l_62bef6dfe4b065b10ad3bed0" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="seven to nine hours of sleep each night" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="62bef6dfe4b065b10ad3bed0" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;seven to nine hours of sleep each night&lt;/a&gt;. If you have trouble getting this much sleep, it’s a good idea to cut back on things like caffeine and alcohol, and to have the same sleep and wake times each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Letting stress go unmanaged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard to not feel stressed about work and family and whatever other things make us stressed out, but just be mindful that we as humans have a very physical stress response to things that are not a physical threat to us,” Whitson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animals have a stress response that kicks in under conditions of urgency, like when they’re being chased by a predator or looking for water. Generally, once the need is met, the stress goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We as humans are able to stress about things that... just don’t pose any physical threat to us ― but then by turning on that stress response and having it kind of chronically activated, it does all kinds of things,” Whitson said. “It reduces our immune system’s ability to fight off real pathogens and things that are our real stressors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress also takes a toll on our metabolism, our sleep, our blood pressure and more. It’s important to do what you can to decrease your stress, whether that’s talking to a mental health professional (if possible) or cutting out things in life that cause you problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Not planning for your future health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talk a lot about planning for end of life — you know, what are you going to do? Do you want CPR? Do you want advanced-care planning? Who’s my power of attorney? Where’s my will?” Lindquist said. “But many times people don’t think about, ‘What am I going to do in the 10 to 20 years before I die?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindquist refers to this time frame as the “fourth quarter of life, because that’s the time when you’re going to have more health problems.” She added that people in their 70s, 80s and 90s are more likely to require hospitalization and deal with worsening memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides deciding who get the lake house, your golf clubs or your engagement ring, you should start thinking about your plan for the last 10 to 20 years of your life, Lindquist explained. Are you going to plan to move in with family? Will you have in-home care? Will you move to a senior community? Do you live near a hospital?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are conversations that people should be having, especially when they’re considering longevity and living longer,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having these conversations with loved ones, you can make sure your voice is heard as you age and that there are no unchecked expectations. To help adults plan for all of the aspects of their future, Lindquist and her team built &lt;a href="https://www.planyourlifespan.org/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Plan Your Lifespan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.planyourlifespan.org/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="17"&gt;Plan Your Lifespan&lt;/a&gt;, a free website funded by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Not planning for your financial future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great when people’s goal is to increase their active longevity and health span... [but] they should know that they have to plan for it financially,” said Whitson. “One of the saddest things that I see as a geriatrician is when increasingly, it happens frequently now, that people outlive their savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Whitson’s patients in their 90s tell her they never expected to live so long, and that they didn’t expect to have to support themselves for another 30 years after retirement. “That happens, and it’s real,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I worry about some of the people that I see at midlife that are sort of expecting to retire at 65 and haven’t really accounted for the fact that if they live 30 healthy years after that, they better be able to know where their money is going to come from,” Whitson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="19"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Hair, which can differ based on style or genetics, might contribute too,' according to a report on the study published by the charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14716101/I-diagnosed-stage-4-cancer-strange-things-happened-skin-symptoms-you-ignore.html"&gt;Melanoma &lt;/a&gt;is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, accounting for four out of five deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiona Osgun, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, warned: 'Getting sunburned just once every couple of years can triple your risk of melanoma skin cancer, compared with never being burned.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that an alarming 87 per cent of melanoma cases, the equivalent of  17,100 in the UK each year, are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, either directly from the sun or sun beds—meaning they could be avoided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because increased UV exposure can damage the DNA in skin cells, triggering mutations that become cancerous. From here, the cancer can spread to the blood vessels beneath the skin, getting into the bloodstream and spreading throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, rates of the cancer reached a record high in the UK, with new diagnoses increasing by almost a third in just a decade, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, experts are warning that melanoma cases are on the rise again—with rates set to surge faster in men than women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Signs of skin cancer range from innocuous to obvious, but experts warn that treating cases early is key to making sure they do not spread or further develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Michelle Mitchell, CEO at Cancer Research, said: 'The growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is concerning, especially when we can see that rates are rising faster in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you notice anything different on your skin, like a new mole, a mole that's changed in size, shape, or colour, or any patch of skin that looks out of the ordinary—don't ignore it, speak to your GP', she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most melanomas—the rarest but most deadly form of skin cancer that is most likely to spread—present as moles that have uneven edges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When diagnosis melanoma, dermatologists look out for asymmetry, border, colour diameter and evolving, known as the ABCDEs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With warmer weather fast approaching, research suggests that 21,300 cases of the disease could be expected this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK has also seen a seven per cent rise in young people, aged 25-49, as experts urge people to contact their GP at the first warning sign of skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to beat skin cancer for everyone, no matter who they are or where they're from', Ms Mitchell explained, 'but, early diagnosis is key and could make all the difference.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity is now urging people to take simple steps to stay safe from UV rays—which can cause significant damage even when it's cloudy or cool. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Comedian Katherine Ryan, 41, revealed earlier this year that she is battling skin cancer for the second time having been diagnosed with Stage 2 cancer in 2004 (pictured on The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer in 2021) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Try to stick to the safe between 11am and 3pm when the sun is strongest, wear clothes that help cover up your skin, with a hat and sunglasses, and use sunscreen with at least SPF30 and 4 or 5 stars', Ms Osgun advised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, added: 'Prevention is by far the best plan with skin cancer, so avoid the sun when it is at its hottest and ensure you use sunscreen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For skin cancer, as for any cancer, it is vital that you are seen and diagnosed as early as possible, so people should come forward if they are concerned about symptoms', he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting checked saves lives'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently around 15,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each year—the UK's fifth most common cancer—with the incidence rate rising faster than any other common cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;How the cancer is treated depends on whether the cancer has spread—with only 27 per cent of patients diagnosed at stage four surviving beyond five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery is the main treatment for the disease, especially if it is found early.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This comes as patients with the deadliest type of skin cancer are set to be given fast-tracked access to a revolutionary cancer vaccine on the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The needle-free injection is custom-built for patients to stop their melanoma returning—which experts believe will herald a new era in fighting the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by boosting the immune system's response, helping it to 'attack' proteins that are specific to melanoma tumours, preventing them from returning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, around half of patients diagnosed with melanoma respond to immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, those who don't are at a higher risk of their cancer getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Improvements in skin cancer survival rates highlight the remarkable progress driven by our research,' Ms Mitchell explained. 'But the growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is still concerning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just 6 months old, KJ received a gene editing treatment custom-built to correct his unique mutation. He’s not cured, researchers explained at the annual American Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Therapy meeting in New Orleans. But he has been able to resume a normal diet and is no longer on the path to a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The news could not have come at a more welcome or more jarring time for the field. For three years, gene editing has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/06/crispr-gene-editing-medical-breakthrough-not-matched-by-financial-success/"&gt;seemed in free fall&lt;/a&gt;, riven by layoffs, closures, shuttered programs and sinking stock prices.  Now here, finally, in striped pajama form, was a reminder of what a decade of advances could deliver. “How awesome is it that we’re at this point?” said Nessan Bermingham, who co-founded and led Intellia, one of the first CRISPR companies, until 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

While omega-6 fats are essential, excessive intake, especially without enough omega-3s, may promote chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is linked to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), which increases the risk of heart attack. Using sunflower oil repeatedly for frying can lead to harmful oxidation products that promote inflammation and damage blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Images Courtesy: istock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​&lt;strong&gt;Can’t eat your food without snapping a picture first?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join our Food Photography Contest and stand a chance to win exciting prizes!&lt;br&gt;Click &lt;a href="https://recipes.timesofindia.com/contest/Taste-the-Lens?utm_source=TF_Articles&amp;amp;utm_medium=Foodsectionl&amp;amp;utm_id=TimesFoodContest"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join our WhatsApp Food Community to discover delicious recipes, enjoy fascinating food stories, and stay updated with the latest food news!

They know that vagus nerve activity, known as vagal tone, reduces heart rate, for instance, but they don't know which of the 200,000 fibers are behind that mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved a vagus nerve stimulation device, which is similar to a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/what-is-a-pacemaker" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; and implanted into a patient's neck, to treat epilepsy in 1997 and depression in 2005. But it's also being studied as a therapy for several inflammatory conditions, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/work-remote-health-condition-return-to-office-policies-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Tracey and his team at the Feinstein Institute became the first to discover this link. When they stimulated the vagus nerves of mice with a handheld stimulator, it reduced their inflammation, measured via levels of inflammatory biomarkers, in their blood by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

But the reality is, the science to prove that any of these hacks work just isn't there yet, Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's probably a good thing. But can we say for certain we understand how it all works? No, not yet," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Tracey believes in his own data and that of his colleagues, so he does most of these things just in case they can help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-atlantic-diet-health-benefits-study-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;prevent chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

He does this because cold exposure triggers the body's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze-fawn" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fight-or-flight response&lt;/a&gt;, which evidence suggests can suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that after the initial shock of the cold, ramping up the heartbeat, the parasympathetic nervous system is then activated, slowing down your breathing and heart rate. This suggests the vagus nerve is activated by cold exposure, but any role it has in reducing inflammation is still unclear, Tracey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="418c72ae-87fb-4544-bf9e-2012dc4a19c3" data-toc-id="418c72ae-87fb-4544-bf9e-2012dc4a19c3"&gt;2) Thirty minutes of daily exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tracey works out for 30 to 45 minutes about five times a week. He does a mixture of cardio, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/strength-training-better-cardio-burning-fat-2023-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;weight and resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, stretching, and yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that exercise is good for you, but you may be surprised to learn that scientists don't fully understand the mechanisms behind the health benefits, Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take running: We know that over time it reduces resting heart rate and increases heart variability (the time in between heartbeats), which indicates the heart is working efficiently. It's possible that this is a result of exercise increasing vagal tone, because it's responsible for slowing the heart down, but more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this turns out to be true or not, working out regularly is a no-brainer investment to make in your health. "Strength training preserves muscle mass, improves metabolic function, and prevents injuries. Aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, enhances cardiovascular health and endurance," Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="71cf1c45-c5fb-4581-9b53-1101ef6dc44c" data-toc-id="71cf1c45-c5fb-4581-9b53-1101ef6dc44c"&gt;3) Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey meditates for 10 minutes most mornings, often using apps such as &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meditation-apps-review-headspace-calm-one-was-way-better-2021-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early research suggests that meditating can reduce inflammation, but more is needed, Tracey said. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735822000095" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that reviewed 48 randomized controlled trials involving 4,638 people found that those who meditated had fewer inflammatory biomarkers in their blood compared with those in control groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that meditation could increase vagus nerve activity, which in turn reduces inflammation, Tracey said, but we lack direct proof.

Both clinical and observational studies show better cholesterol, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity after eating blueberries.

This can be assessed by a simple ultrasound examination of the liver when it is bigger and brighter than usual – that's a sure sign of fatty liver.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, happens when your liver cells gather too much fat, and this fat interferes with the normal metabolic functions of the liver cells. There are two main types: one caused by drinking too much alcohol (AFLD) and the other not linked to alcohol but associated with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic dysfunction (NAFLD).”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some victims were poisoned with laced bottles of Hunyadi mineral water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bizarre twist, her dad - in the throes of mental health issues - sewed his own eyelids shut and abandoned his two daughters at the Boston Female Asylum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Honora was later taken in as an indentured servant by the wealthy Toppan family and her name changed to Jane Toppan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'm probably the only person who's been researching her who feels sorry for her,’ Ranney says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Everyone else calls her a monster, which in a way she was, but the more I looked into things, the more I thought, she's a very interesting person.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through her years of research, Ranney says it’s ‘a question of why she was like she was’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s a question Toppan gave a curious answer for after she was caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her young adulthood, Toppan was jilted at the altar by her fiancé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to blame her lover - and being unmarried - for sending her down her dark and deadly path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If I had been a married woman I probably would not have killed all these people,’ she infamously claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rejected by her lover, Toppan decided to train at Cambridge Hospital to be a nurse - a vocation that would give her the knowledge of drugs and position of trust that she would later exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

She took very, very good care of them… But in the end, she wound up killing them,’ Ranney says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear exactly when the killing spree started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During her time at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Cambridge School of Nursing, many patients mysteriously died in her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she then turned to private nursing, providing her rich patients with home visits, there were also curious spates of fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surprisingly, the deaths were always explained away by some illness or another - and no alarm was raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several years would pass before anyone suspected the nurse of killing the patients she had doted on with such care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For other victims, Toppan’s murders were far more personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was her foster sister Elizabeth Brigham who she had grown up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toppan also murdered her foster sister Elizabeth Brigham (pictured) who she had grown up with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her best friend Sarah Connors whose job she wanted to take at a theology school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her love interest’s sister Edna Bannister who she felt was getting in the way of a romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And her former landlords Israel and Lovey Dunham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan’s luck only ran out when she murdered the Davis family in summer 1901 after they had dared to ask her to finally pay the $500 in overdue rent she owed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even Toppan went on to admit this may have finally been a step too far, declaring: ‘That was the greatest mistake of my life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following pressure from Gibbs’ father-in-law, her body was exhumed and a fatal dose of morphine discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan’s depraved killing spree was a secret no more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In October 1901, the 47-year-old was arrested for murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, she only stood trial for the murder of Gibbs in a case that hit headlines across the US as the media and public poured over the story of a perverse female serial killer who got a sexual kick out of killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victims who lived to tell the tale came forward with their shocking stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient described Toppan plying her with a mystery drink and then clambering on top of her, kissing and caressing her while she lay suffering in a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jane Toppan was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Massachusetts psychiatric hospital in Taunton (pictured) where she lived until her death in 1938&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the woman passed the bizarre encounter off as a dream - only learning how close she came to being another victim when Toppan was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While suspected of 11 murders, a bombshell confession letter published in the New York Journal revealed Toppan’s actual death toll was at least 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the shocking declaration, Toppan boasted that her depraved goal was ‘to have killed more people - helpless people - than any other man or woman who lived’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also described being driven by an ‘uncontrollable passion’ for death, writing that: ‘No voice has as much melody in it as the one crying for life; no eyes as bright as those about to become fixed and glassy; no face so beautiful as the one pulseless and cold.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ranney says there is no indication that Toppan deliberately chose a career in nursing to give her the opportunity to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don't think it started out like that. I think she may have accidentally killed someone without realizing… she may have just decided, “oh, look what I can do. Wow, that really gave me a thrill.” But I don't think she became a nurse for that reason,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think part of it was a sense that she was powerful.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A courtroom sketch of the trial of Jane Toppan in the Boston Daily Globe on November 1, 1901&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toppan (pictured) would climb into bed with her victims and get a sexual thrill from the moment they died &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a century on, however, questions remain as to whether it was really Toppan who penned the shocking confession letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ranney isn’t so sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I've always wondered whether it really was [her],’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It did not strike me that it was her writing… just the way it's written. I don't think she would have been quite so blunt about things. It just seems to me that her nature was to be more secretive.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: ‘But then again, by that time, she may have decided that she was just going to confess because it brought her more notoriety.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Massachusetts psychiatric hospital in Taunton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lived there until her death in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Somewhat ironically, Toppan would often refuse to eat and drink at the facility - paranoid that someone was trying to poison her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 03:57:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOX0dyOWVzc2hBTGhJWFNGQUtpN24yUnoxNldNbVk2aWVVek85aTdjWUJoR1hlN1F6Yk9Xbl9CXzhwckFaQnFGZzBCd0wyUmxfamd0cG1yc3dQdURIQ3RudWFxREQxOS12Z3Y0THdGS0dtRXdpcUVESkVZLXZOZW52OXJuNkQzSGtpSDBPeTBXT0tncWpuejNZNEhwdw</guid></item><item><title>科学家首次在英国发现西尼罗河病毒- ScienceAlert | Scientists Discover West Nile Virus in The UK For The First Time - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNZ3Y1ZDFYdEc0SWRYSy1IUU50SDNsSWhCUkxueGhxcW02QlpxYlZsMkRfNG9sLV9zSE5paGZ5Zkx6QjZtb2E4YU51aFRsYVFRanVRRWZDTUM4ekgtbW9qR0JZd2lRVUVyMUdmUXJab0Z5OGVkVUNmaEozWFM2cDRWQVAzbTIwLURoUS1iSXFLZEdfMVRqX09yZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For the first time, traces of the West Nile  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; have been found in mosquitoes in the UK, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-detection-of-west-nile-virus-in-uk-mosquitoes"&gt;published this week&lt;/a&gt; by the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about the virus and the disease it causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is West Nile virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus first identified in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3111838/"&gt;Uganda in 1937&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the same viral family as dengue and yellow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is most commonly transmitted by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Culex&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the species &lt;em&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mve.12802"&gt;mainly feeds on birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds are the primary host for West Nile virus, and the virus &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;spreads in a cycle&lt;/a&gt; from infected birds to mosquitoes and then back to birds. Occasionally, mosquitoes can transmit the virus to humans or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most human infections – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;around 80%&lt;/a&gt; – cause no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are usually mild: fever, fatigue, headaches, body aches and sometimes nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in rare cases, around one in 150 infections, the virus can cause severe illness, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis. Older adults, especially those over 50, are most at risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus cannot normally be spread from person to person, though rare cases of transmission have occurred through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/php/transmission/index.html"&gt;blood transfusions&lt;/a&gt; or from mother to baby during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did it get to the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the exact route isn't known, experts believe the virus may have arrived in the UK via migratory birds infected elsewhere. The mosquitoes probably picked up the virus after feeding on these birds during their northward journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection was made as part of a routine mosquito surveillance programme run by the Animal and Plant Health Agency. Mosquitoes collected from marshlands in south-east England tested positive in PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, which detect fragments of the virus's genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that a positive PCR test doesn't necessarily mean the virus is infectious. After a mosquito becomes infected, the &lt;a href="https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(24)00230-5/fulltext"&gt;virus needs time&lt;/a&gt; – several days – to multiply inside the mosquito before it can be transmitted. And this process is highly temperature dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162591" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162591" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle.jpg" alt="An illustration of a colorful virus particle" class="wp-image-162591 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162591" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of West Nile virus particles. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the virus spread in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's relatively cool climate has, until now, helped keep mosquito-borne diseases at bay. At summer temperatures of around 15°C, it can take up to 100 days for the virus to develop inside a mosquito – longer than the insect's lifespan. In contrast, in hotter climates (above 30°C), this process can take just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a local outbreak to occur, there would need to be a critical mass of infected birds and mosquitoes, with enough warm weather to sustain multiple cycles of transmission. So far, that hasn't happened in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; could alter the equation. With rising global temperatures and longer, hotter summers, the conditions that allow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; such as West Nile to spread may become more common in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's happening elsewhere?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus was once limited to Africa and the Middle East but has spread significantly in recent decades. Large outbreaks have been recorded in countries including Greece, Romania, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008042"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, Russia and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US outbreak began in New York City in 1999 when an unusual number of birds were found dead in a city zoo. A &lt;a href="https://asm.org/magazine/2021/fall/we-are-all-connected-looking-at-the-big-picture-wi"&gt;veterinary pathologist&lt;/a&gt; at the Bronx Zoo, Tracey McNamara, helped link the bird deaths to the human illnesses being reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the virus has spread across &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/index.html"&gt;most of the US&lt;/a&gt;, Canada and parts of South America, resulting in over 60,000 reported human cases, 28,000 hospitalisations and more than 3,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 19 European countries reported a total of &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/infectious-disease-topics/west-nile-virus-infection/surveillance-and-disease-data/monthly-updates"&gt;1,436 local cases&lt;/a&gt;, most in men over 65, with 125 deaths. Most were in Italy, Greece and Spain – countries with hot, mosquito-friendly summers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks were also reported in birds and horses, which are both susceptible to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should UK residents be concerned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes is noteworthy, experts emphasise that the public health risk remains very low. No human cases have been reported in the UK to date, and current summer temperatures are not yet conducive to sustained transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater risk for most British people probably comes from travel – particularly to southern Europe, where cases are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travellers are advised to take &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;standard mosquito precautions&lt;/a&gt;: wear light-coloured clothing, long sleeves and trousers, and use insect repellent, especially in the evening when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the virus is unlikely to spread widely in the UK. But as climate patterns shift, continued surveillance and public awareness will be key to staying ahead of the risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257295/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has found the herpes simplex  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; type 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores, may be linked to the development of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="162572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea is not entirely new. Previous research has suggested there &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.1890330403"&gt;may be an association&lt;/a&gt; between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;most common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we make of these new findings? And how strong is this link? Let's take a look at the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, what is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 is a neurotropic virus, meaning it can infect nerve cells, which send and receive messages to and from the brain. It's an extremely common virus. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;World Health Organization estimates&lt;/a&gt; nearly two-thirds of the global population aged under 50 carries this virus, often unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial infection can cause mild to severe symptoms including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="162572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, headache and muscle aches, and may manifest as blisters and ulcers around the mouth or lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore.jpg" alt="Cold sore" class="wp-image-142288 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore-597x415.jpg 597w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore-600x417.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cold sores are signs of HSV-1. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_sore#/media/File:Herpes(PHIL_1573_lores).jpg"&gt;Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this, HSV-1 typically &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8923070/"&gt;lies dormant&lt;/a&gt; in the body's nervous system, sometimes reactivating due to stress or illness. During reactivation, it can cause symptoms such as cold sores, although in many people it doesn't cause any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did the new research look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published this week &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946"&gt;in BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analysed data from hundreds of thousands of people drawn from a large United States health insurance dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conducted a matched "case-control" analysis involving more than 340,000 adults aged 50 and older diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease between 2006 and 2021. Each Alzheimer's disease patient (a "case") was matched to a control without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on factors such as age, sex and geographic region, a method designed to reduce statistical bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then examined how many of these people had a prior diagnosis of HSV-1 and whether they had been prescribed antiviral treatment for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among people with Alzheimer's disease, 0.44% had a previous HSV-1 diagnosis, compared to 0.24% of controls. This translates to an 80% increased relative risk of Alzheimer's disease in those diagnosed with HSV-1, however the absolute numbers are small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found people who received antiviral treatment for HSV-1 had roughly a 17% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those who were untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not a new hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have speculated about a viral role in Alzheimer's disease. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.1890330403"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have detected &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;HSV-1 DNA in postmortem brain tissues&lt;/a&gt; from people who had Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory research has also shown &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.030"&gt;HSV-1 can trigger amyloid-beta plaque accumulation&lt;/a&gt; in nerve cells and mouse brains. Amyloid-beta plaques are one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease pathology, so this has led to speculation that reactivation of the virus may contribute to brain inflammation or damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But importantly, previous research and the current study show associations, not proof HSV-1 causes Alzheimer's disease. These links do not confirm the virus initiates or drives disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some other important caveats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study relied on insurance claim data, which may not always reflect accurate or timely clinical diagnoses. HSV-1 is also frequently underdiagnosed, especially when symptoms are mild or absent. These points could explain why both the Alzheimer's group and the control group saw such low rates of HSV-1, when population rates of this virus &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;are estimated to be far higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means many carriers of HSV-1 in the study may have gone unrecorded and therefore makes the link harder to interpret clearly. The dataset also doesn't capture how often people had recurring symptoms, or the severity or duration of infections – conditions which might influence risk more directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is people with HSV-1 might differ in other ways from those without it. Differences in health-care access, the health of a person's &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00144-4/fulltext"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60630-3/abstract"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; – could all influence Alzheimer's disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So should you be concerned if you have cold sores?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no – at least not based on current evidence. Most people with HSV-1 will never develop Alzheimer's disease. The vast majority live with the virus without any serious neurological issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "herpes hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease is an interesting area for further research, but far from settled science. This study adds weight to the conversation but doesn't offer a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a complex condition with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/dementia-prevention-intervention-and-care"&gt;multiple risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, including age, genetics, heart health, education, lifestyle and environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections such as HSV-1 may be one part of a larger, interconnected puzzle, but they are highly unlikely to be the sole cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the best thing to do is to focus on what we already know can help keep your brain healthy as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00184-9/abstract#:%7E:text=Emerging%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20sedentary,impairment%20and%20reduce%20dementia%20risk."&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-well-and-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia-and-death-2021050322508"&gt;good quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/social-isolation"&gt;social engagement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/diet-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/protect-your-brain-from-stress"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt; can all support long-term brain health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257140/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; detected in international travelers arriving at airports like LAX in Los Angeles. (Photo by FREDERIC J.

&lt;p&gt;Remember COVID-19? That thing that’s &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" aria-label="killed around 350 people a week in the U.S."&gt;killed around 350 people a week in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; over the past month and continues to leave more and more people with long Covid? Remember the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that’s still spreading, mutating, “varianting” and “subvarianting” and causing COVID-19? Well, nota bene or N.B., there’s a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 in town. It is called the NB.1.8.1 variant, has been causing COVID-19 surges in China, Hong King and Taiwan and is now spreading in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XEC And LF.7 Are Past Their Peak While LP.8.1 Is Currently Dominant In The U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider NB.1.8.1 to be the latest in the alphabet soup of SARS-COv-2 variants that deserves close attention. Each SARS-CoV-2 variant and subvariant is sort of like fidget spinners, those mustache tattoos on the side of finger and cup stacking. They emerge and spread quickly but then are rapidly supplanted by new variants and subvariants that spread faster. But some have caused more problems than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" aria-label="Global virus tracking reports"&gt;Global virus tracking reports&lt;/a&gt; from the scientific community that continues to, you know, work together and collaborate worldwide suggest that the XEC variant that &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/28/xec-variant-may-be-driving-silent-covid-19-surge-in-december-2024/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/28/xec-variant-may-be-driving-silent-covid-19-surge-in-december-2024/" target="_self" aria-label="I described for Forbes back in December 2024"&gt;I described for &lt;em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/28/xec-variant-may-be-driving-silent-covid-19-surge-in-december-2024/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; back in December 2024&lt;/a&gt; is largely on its way out, except for in Japan. Meanwhile, LF.7 seems to have gone the way of the TV series &lt;em&gt;NCIS&lt;/em&gt; and already lready peaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the dominant variant in North America, parts of South America, much of Europe and South Africa is LP.8.1. This variant was first detected in September 2024 and by the end of 2024 was spreading around the globe. It has been effectively the variant of this past Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NB.1.8.1 And XFG Are Currently Spreading The Fastest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Spring has seen the rise of the XFG variant, a recombinant of the LF.7 and LP.8.1.2 variants. It was first found in Quebec, Canada, in early February, and near the end of that month U.S. testing started detecting the variant. You could say that XFG has been spreading “extra freaking good” since then. By the end of April, XFG comprised about 10% of all the SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced in North America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next month or so may turn out to be grudge match or perhaps a race between the XFG and NB.1.8.1 variants. Both have been spreading at similar rates. But they’ve been doing so in different parts of the world. During the same time period that XFG got a foothold or perhaps a spikehold in North America and Europe, NB.1.8.1 has become the dominant variant in Hong Kong and China. By the end of April, NB.1.8.1 already comprised 5 to 30% of the virus samples sequenced in most other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be an Alien vs. Predator situation. Each of these two variants has its competitive advantage. NB.1.8.1 seems to connect to human cells more readily than XFG while XFG seems to be able evade immune protection better. Therefore, which variant becomes more dominant where may depend on everyone’s prior exposure and vaccination status in that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NB.1.8.1 Has Led To Surges in ER Visits And Hospitalizations In China And Hong Kong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NB.1.8.1 variant has been causing a commotion in China and Hong Kong. It’s resulted in emergency room visits and hospitalizations surging higher in those locations than it’s been in at least a year. Hong Kong authorities have been urging their resident to wear face masks in crowded public areas. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s health authorities have been stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments to respond to the NB.1.8.1 -dirven wave that they’ve seen too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far, there’s no clear indication that NB.1.8.1 is more likely to cause more severe health outcomes than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. But stay tuned because more studies are needed to get a better handle on what both NB.1.8.1 and XFG can do and which may eventually come out the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NB.1.8.1 Is Now Being Detected in the U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. doesn’t currently have a organized and comprehensive surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 since its only had like five years to set one up, right? So, it must rely on incidentally picking up new variants. That will occur if a person chooses to get tested, if that person chooses not to use a home test but instead goes to somewhere connected to a laboratory to get tested, if that laboratory either has the capability of sequencing the genetic material and chooses to do so or send the sample to a laboratory that does such a thing and if the results of the sequencing are reported to public health officials. That’s a lot of ifs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the NB.1.8.1 variant is clearly already in the U.S. It’s come up in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s airport screening program among international travelers entering via California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area airports. There have been reported NB.1.8.1 cases in Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii as well. So once can assume that the NB.1.8.1 has already got a spikehold in American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does The NB.1.8.1 Variant Mean For Vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines available right now contain either the spike proteins (the Novavax vaccines) from a previous variant or mRNA that codes for these spike proteins (the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines). These updated vaccines were first rolled out last Fall and targeted the KP.2 variant, a descendant of the JN.1 variant. For the vaccines to be available this Fall, there had been talk of either no changes in the vaccines or updating with a more recent variant such as LP.8.1. While the currently available vaccines coudl provide some protection against NB.1.8.1, you’d get better protection with a vaccine targeting LP.8.1 because as a variant that’s emerged more recently L.P.8.1 is more similar to NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is The U.S. Doing About The NB.1.8.1 Variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what else then is the U.S. doing about the NB.1.8.1? How about not a whole lot? Politicians have already politicized the heck out of COVID-19 control measures like face mask use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now talking about rolling back approval of the COVID-19 vaccines to just those over 65 years of age or with at least one chronic medical condition. With immunity from prior vaccination and infection will such rollbacks means that a greater proportion of the population will once again be more vulnerable to the latest circulating variants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, don’t expect too much guidance from the federal government as to what to do about the NB.1.8.1 variant or COVID-19 in general, for that matter. Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic first started, the U.S. still does not have a clear long term strategy on how to deal with COVID-19 and long COVID. Don’t expect this to change with especially with all the personnel cuts that have been happening at the CDC and National Institutes of Health under the Trump Administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE, otherwise known as the Department of Government Efficiency. While SARS-CoV-2 isn’t the same threat that it was in 2020 and 2021 in large part because your immune systems is more used to the virus, the virus has not gone away or become harmless no matter what politicians may try to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are several factors that influence blood pressure levels beyond just sodium intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy carbohydrates can provide nutrients like potassium, fiber, vitamins and minerals that support healthy blood pressure and overall heart health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include foods like fruits, beans, yogurt and oats in your diet to reap the benefits.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Approximately 1 out of 2 U.S. adults has high blood pressure, putting them at an increased risk of stroke, heart attack and other undesired outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When a person is diagnosed with high blood pressure, the first diet tip that is typically given is to limit the consumption of dietary sodium. And while that is probably a good idea, there are many other nutrients that play a role. Following the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2054270/how-to-follow-the-dash-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, has been shown to lower blood pressure significantly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It emphasizes foods like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nonfat or low-fat milk and dairy foods, lean meat, poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, legumes and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are a carb lover and have high blood pressure, the good news is that the DASH diet includes several carb-rich foods. And opting for plant-based carbohydrate-containing foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains may help lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, too many added sugars from foods like sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with higher blood pressure levels and higher hypertension risk.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Limiting ultra-processed carbs like doughnuts and candy and focusing on carbs that are more nutrient-dense is a good rule of thumb when navigating your carb choices. Here are some of the best carbs to include in your diet for healthy blood pressure levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Bananas  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The darling of potassium-containing foods, bananas are one of the best carb-rich foods to eat to support healthy blood pressure. Since the American Heart Association recommends that adults with &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/how-potassium-can-help-control-high-blood-pressure" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood pressure above 120/80 increase their dietary potassium intake&lt;/a&gt;, including bananas in your eating pattern is a smart choice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you can enjoy a banana simply by peeling it and eating it when you are on the go. But you can also whip up some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7916777/tart-cherry-nice-cream/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tart Cherry Nice Cream&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267647/chocolate-banana-protein-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chocolate-Banana Protein Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; to help you add in some extra potassium.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans offer some natural carbs along with plant-based protein and a slew of vitamins and minerals, including healthy blood-pressure-supporting magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, the soluble and insoluble fiber, including resistant starch naturally found in beans, may&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913519/what-are-legumes-are-they-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; help support blood pressure control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt has become a popular food among the gut-health-supporting crowd, thanks to its live and active cultures that can help maintain a balanced microbiome. But yogurt is so much more than a probiotic-packed dairy food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to blood pressure support, data showed that, among a small sample of people with high blood pressure, the simple act of eating yogurt may help reduce those numbers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dairy yogurt naturally contains the trifecta of the healthy blood-pressure-supporting minerals calcium, magnesium and potassium. Plus, the probiotics found in yogurt may play a separate role in reducing blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt can be used to make various dishes, from a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7937679/mini-frozen-yogurt-parfaits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mini Frozen Yogurt Parfait&lt;/a&gt; to a refreshing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249318/fruit-yogurt-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fruit &amp;amp; Yogurt Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, yogurt can simply be enjoyed on its own, topped with berries and a drizzle of honey.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Watermelon is juicy, naturally sweet, and delicious. And as an added bonus, it may support healthy blood pressure levels. A meta-analysis looked into how watermelon consumption might influence heart health, focusing specifically on factors like blood pressure. Results showed that watermelon consumption significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP), showing just how great this fruit can be when trying to keep blood pressure levels in in-check.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains, like oats, are better options to support healthy blood pressure when it comes to grain choices. Unlike refined grains that typically only contain the endosperm of the grain, whole grains contain all three parts of the grain—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the bran, endosperm and germ&lt;/a&gt;—giving these foods a nutritional edge. Whole grains contain more abundant and diverse nutrients with potential health benefits, including more fiber, vitamins and minerals compared with most of their refined counterparts. Data shows a protective association between consuming more whole grains and a lower risk for high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating plenty of fiber-rich whole grains might also reduce the risk of hypertension by giving a boost to your gut microbiota. Oats may be especially valuable because they contain a type of fiber called beta-glucans, which has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;both lower systolic and lower diastolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

One study showed that, when people ate fresh blueberries, powdered blueberries, and a control (no blueberries) over several weeks, while no major differences were found between the groups in terms of blood pressure, the study did find that fresh and powdered blueberries slightly improved levels of a compound (nitrite) that may support blood vessel health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An older study showed that eating around 1 cup of wild blueberries (the slightly smaller blueberries that are typically found frozen in your grocery store) every day may help reduce systolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, nutrients that can help support a person's cardiovascular and overall health. And like many other naturally blue or purple foods, blueberries contain anthocyanins, a polyphenol that gives these foods that beautiful colorful hue and may account for the blood pressure benefits that have been observed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While wild blueberries contain more anthocyanins than cultivated blueberries, all blueberries pack a serious anthocyanin punch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a glass of 100% orange juice can do much more for you than support your immune system. Pure OJ is a natural source of potassium, one of the highlighted minerals of the DASH diet. Citrus fruits, like the oranges used to make 100% OJ, contain an antioxidant called hesperidin. This antioxidant may play a role in supporting heart health in various ways.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one randomized controlled trial, people with either stage 1 or pre-hypertension who consumed 500 milliliters of orange juice daily for 12 weeks had significantly reduced systolic blood pressure compared with those who drank a hesperidin-free drink with the same amount of calories, vitamin C and citric acid.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252664/carrot-orange-juice/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carrot Orange Juice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/frozen-orange-ginger-turmeric-shots-11685589" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Frozen Orange-Ginger-Turmeric Shots&lt;/a&gt; can give you a boost of hesperidin in a delicious vessel.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to managing blood pressure levels, sodium might be the first thing that comes to mind. And while limiting sodium intake can be helpful, there are several other things to consider when following a DASH diet eating pattern. Namely, certain carbs like fruits, beans, yogurt and oats can provide nutrients like potassium and fiber which are crucial for heart health and blood pressure management.

And that’s what happened to 36-year-old Ashley (Aevie) Vielma. The Houston, Texas resident knew that her blood pressure was climbing, and she decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A History of Hypertension &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vielma was aware of her family’s history with high blood pressure. She shares that her grandmother, mother and sister, along with other family members, have been diagnosed with high blood pressure. She also lacked a consistent &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-lose-weight-trainers-share-192736890.html" data-ylk="slk:exercise routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn’t help that she ate a “poor diet” that was high in salty, processed foods and saturated fats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also admits that &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/exactly-happens-body-don-t-161314378.html" data-ylk="slk:low-quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;low-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; was to blame. “I would fall asleep with my phone and rarely got more than six hours of sleep each night,” she says, adding that she was always stressed out and dehydrated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consequently, Vielma became pre-hypertensive in her late 20s in 2015, with a reading of 125/82. “My worst number was 128/95 in 2019 during an acute period of high anxiety and stress,” she says. “My doctor began monitoring my blood pressure regularly to make sure the elevated numbers were not sustained.

She shares that despite how much she enjoyed indulging in her favorite foods, she ultimately knew that it was taking a toll on her health. That’s when she started drinking at least two liters of water daily, which made it easier to feel satisfied instead of overeating at every meal.

                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seventeen years ago, cardiologist Eric Topol set out to learn why some people remain healthy well into old age while others do not—and discovered that the single most powerful key to aging well may be surprisingly simple and within everyone's reach. He and his colleagues sequenced the genomes of about 1,400 people in their 80s and older who had no major chronic diseases, people they dubbed the "Wellderly," reports the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/well/live/eric-topol-longevity-tips.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The results&lt;em&gt; w&lt;/em&gt;ere unexpected: They found no clear genetic explanation behind their healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Topol's subsequent exploration of what could account for the way in which they aged is the subject of his new book, &lt;em&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-based Approach to Longevity&lt;/em&gt;. The key takeaway from his review of hundreds of studies? Exercise stands out as the single most important factor influencing how we age, particularly strength and resistance training. While diet and social connections matter, Topol tells the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/21/longevity-exercise-resistance-training/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that exercise is "the only intervention in people that has shown any effect on slowing the body-wide aging clock, meaning it appears to change how rapidly we age."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Topol now supplements the aerobic exercise he has done for decades with dumbbells, resistance bands, and bodyweight exercises at home, and credits strength training for improvements in his balance, posture, and overall fitness. He stresses that it's never too late to start strength training. "This idea that you can't build muscle or strength as you age is silly." He should know; Topol didn't start until his late 60s. The goal isn't about lifespan but healthspan, he clarifies, "our years of life that are without the major age-related diseases. ... What we can see from studies is that you can get seven to 10 years of extra healthy aging from lifestyle factors, especially exercise."  (This content was created with the help of AI.

But because it’s always exposed, it also gets hit with things like sunlight and UV rays, which can lead to sunburn, long-term skin damage, or even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve long believed that stepping out into the sun requires ample sunscreen slathering, shade-seeking, and hat-wearing, especially between the peak hours of 12 noon and 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanyang Technological University&lt;/a&gt; (NTU Singapore) have made surprising new strides in our understanding of sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the DNA damage we’ve always associated with sunburn might not be the complete story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-rna-and-sunburn-damage"&gt;DNA, RNA, and sunburn damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sunburn, the prevailing wisdom suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-can-now-collect-human-dna-from-water-air-and-basically-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; damage triggers inflammation and subsequent cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this recent research suggests that the real offender might be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-world-unraveling-mysteries-life-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt;, not DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sunburn damages the DNA, leading to cell death and inflammation. So the textbooks say,” stated assistant professor Anna Constance Vind from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/organisations/institut-for-cellul%C3%A6r-og-molekyl%C3%A6r-medicin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in this study we were surprised to learn that this is a result of damage to the RNA, not the DNA that causes the acute effects of sunburn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what’s the difference between DNA and RNA? While they share similarities, the two aren’t interchangeable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA is a more consistent molecule, whereas RNA is more transitory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particular type of RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), carries information from DNA to create proteins – the fundamental building blocks of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-rna-the-basics"&gt;Understanding RNA — the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-world-unraveling-mysteries-life-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is like the cell’s versatile messenger, playing several key roles in keeping our bodies running smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike DNA, which holds the long-term genetic blueprint, RNA is more dynamic and can move around the cell to help build proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA essentially acts as the bridge between our genetic code and the actual production of the proteins that do all the work in our cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-we-fix-faulty-genes-before-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt;, or messenger RNA, is a special type of RNA that has gained a lot of attention, especially with the development of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA carries the instructions from DNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of mRNA as a temporary copy of a specific gene that tells the cell exactly which protein to produce and when. This makes mRNA incredibly important for everything from growth and repair to responding to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mrna-and-ultraviolet-rays"&gt;mRNA and ultraviolet rays&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of mRNA in our body’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-does-skin-become-leathery-after-too-much-uv-light-from-sun-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; can’t be understated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DNA damage is serious as the mutations will get passed down to progenies of the cells, RNA damage happens all the time and does not cause permanent mutations,” Vind explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, we used to believe that the RNA is less important, as long as the DNA is intact. But in fact, damages to the RNA are the first to trigger a response to UV radiation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating more deeply into the matter was no small task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers embarked on a study involving both mice and human skin cells to better understand the consequences of UV radiation on the skin. They discovered a consistent response in both species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zak-alpha-and-sunburn-damage"&gt;ZAK-alpha and sunburn damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA damage activates a response in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-the-cellular-mortality-timer-that-dictates-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ribosomes&lt;/a&gt; (protein complexes that interpret the mRNA to assemble proteins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is managed by a protein known as ZAK-alpha, which triggers what is referred to as the “ribotoxic stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it like a vigilant watchman, always on the lookout for RNA damage. When it detects any, it won’t hesitate to call for backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the first thing the cells respond to after being exposed to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-sunbathing-help-you-lose-weight-uv-radiation-triggers-fat-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; is damage to the RNA, and that this is what triggers cell death and inflammation of the skin,” explained Professor Simon Bekker-Jensen, who was also from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice exposed to UV radiation we found responses such as inflammation and cell death, but when we removed the ZAK gene, these responses disappeared, which means that ZAK plays a key role in the skin’s response to UV-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So you could say that everything depends on this one response, which monitors all protein translations occurring,” Bekker-Jensen elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cells respond to the RNA damage, realizing that something is wrong, and this is what leads to cell death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paradigm-shift"&gt;Paradigm shift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings question our long-held beliefs about sunburn and how our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/skins-secret-strength-shields-against-puncture-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; safeguards itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests that RNA damage sparks a quicker, more efficient response, which safeguards the skin from additional harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the DNA does not control the skin’s initial response to UV radiation, but that something else does and that it does so more effectively and more quickly, is quite the paradigm shift,” reflected Vind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/01/24163120/sunburn-study_graphical-illustration_credit-Molecular-Cell-Journal_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/01/24163127/sunburn-study_graphical-illustration_credit-Molecular-Cell-Journal_1s.webp" alt="Using ZAK knockout mice, we here show that it is the RSR that is responsible for the early manifestation of UVB-induced skin inflammation and keratinocyte death and subsequent proliferation in vivo.

Thus, understanding how our skin responds at the cellular level to UV damage opens the door to innovative treatments for certain chronic skin conditions,” explained Dr. Franklin Zhong, Nanyang assistant professor at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rewriting-the-textbooks"&gt;Rewriting the textbooks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, it seems now is the time to revise our textbooks and rethink how we perceive the effects of UV radiation on our skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new knowledge turns things upside down. I think most people associate sunburn with DNA damage; it is established knowledge,” Professor Simon Bekker-Jensen concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But now we need to rewrite the textbooks, and it will affect future research on the effects of UV radiation on the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276524008840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 21:13:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPc2MyMVB2SW9NQkZSWGpvOFJPaTQ3eldXRmVEY3NFaHFhNHhraFlQQmQzNjBicy1CQ1BmRGtNemJHVmRZYUN3ekxuRy1aX0c0ai1yQVFkQk9oRkhqeWxBX3NDVHJuNEppeWhYOUpueWhudDE4Y3JuNnk1OUdLd1JFX0pPX2dkZE1MX2RLRTlMVVo</guid></item><item><title>在人类皮肤上发现的这种常见真菌可以消除致命的超级细菌葡萄球菌感染-好消息网络 | This Common Fungus Found on Human Skin Wipes Out Deadly Superbug Staph Infections - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQei12Q0RETnVGQUFBQVNZSXRILWROV2lOMWt0SXlFYVpnWEY5NlBEZmFUMnVBRGNUQmpERTF6Q1FhUmxtcERxcWpsOWt4SUQxbl9Fc0Q4cnR6SnFCU29LWXpqTk5JamhZcUZxNDc3NG9TZnV4bzVZdEFJcktoZkpkUTNGelByU1Q5bE5qVm5Xd3Ffd21ESmNpcUk4YV9rUFZFb1NGY1N3RFM2WjY2WUlfX24zSkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University of Oregon researchers have uncovered a molecule produced by yeast living on human skin that showed potent antimicrobial properties against a pathogen responsible for a half-million hospitalizations annually in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a unique approach to tackling the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. With the global threat of drug-resistant infections, fungi inhabiting human skin are an untapped resource for identifying new antibiotics, said Caitlin Kowalski, a postdoctoral researcher at the UO who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(25)00371-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a paper published&lt;/a&gt; last month in Current Biology, the common skin fungus Malassezia gobbles up oil and fats on human skin to produce fatty acids that selectively eliminate Staphylococcus aureus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One out of every three people have Staphylococcus aureus harmlessly dwelling in their nose, but the bacteria are a risk factor for serious infections when given the opportunity: open wounds, abrasions and cuts. They’re the primary cause of skin and soft tissue infections known as staph infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staphylococcus aureus is also a hospital superbug notorious for being resistant to current antibiotics, elevating the pressing need for new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of studies that identify new antibiotic structures, Kowalski said, “but what was fun and interesting about ours is that we identified (a compound) that is well-known and that people have studied before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound is not toxic in normal lab conditions, but it can be potent in conditions that replicate the acidic environment of healthy skin. “I think that’s why in some cases we may have missed these kinds of antimicrobial mechanisms,” Kowalski added, “because the pH in the lab wasn’t low enough. But human skin is really acidic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Stanford Scientists Transform Ubiquitous Skin Bacteria into a Topical Vaccine Against Tetanus" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/stanford-scientists-transform-ubiquitous-skin-bacterium-into-a-topical-vaccine-against-tetanus/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Stanford Scientists Transform Ubiquitous Skin Bacteria into a Topical Vaccine Against Tetanus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans play host to a colossal array of microorganisms, known as the microbiome, but we know little about our resident fungi and their contributions to human health, Kowalski said. The skin microbiome is of special interest to her because while other body parts crowd dozens of different fungi, the skin is dominantly colonized by one kind known as Malassezia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malassezia can be associated with cases of dandruff and eczema, but it’s considered relatively harmless and a normal part of skin flora. The yeast has evolved to live on mammalian skin, so much so that it can’t make fatty acids without the lipids—oils and fats—secreted by skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the abundance of Malassezia found on us, they remain understudied, Kowalski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The skin is a parallel system to what’s happening in the gut, which is really well-studied,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she said in a media release&lt;/a&gt;. “We know that the intestinal microbiome can modify host compounds and make their own unique compounds that have new functions. Skin is lipid-rich, and the skin microbiome processes these lipids to also produce bioactive compounds. So what does this mean for skin health and diseases?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK THIS OUT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Itching Solution: New Approach Could Treat Inflammatory Skin Conditions Like Eczema with ‘Huge Benefits’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/itching-solution-new-approach-could-treat-inflammatory-skin-conditions-like-eczema-with-huge-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Itching Solution: New Approach Could Treat Inflammatory Skin Conditions Like Eczema with ‘Huge Benefits’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at human skin samples from healthy donors and experiments done with skin cells in the lab, Kowalski found that the fungal species Malassezia sympodialis transformed host lipids into antibacterial hydroxy fatty acids. Fatty acids have various functions in cells but are notably the building blocks for cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydroxy fatty acids synthesized by Malassezia sympodialis were detergent-like, destroying the membranes of Staphylococcus aureus and causing its internal contents to leak away. The attack prevented the colonization of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin and ultimately killed the bacteria in as little as 15 minutes, Kowalski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fungus isn’t a magic bullet. After enough exposure, the staph bacteria eventually became tolerant to the fungus, as they do when clinical antibiotics are overused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at their genetics, the researchers found that the bacteria evolved a mutation in the Rel gene, which activates the bacterial stress response. Similar mutations have been previously identified in patients with Staphylococcus aureus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMAZING&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="14-year-old Invents Soap for Treating Skin Cancer and Wins Top Honor as America’s Top Young Scientist" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/14-year-old-invents-soap-for-treating-skin-cancer-and-wins-top-honor-as-americas-top-young-scientist/" rel="bookmark"&gt;14-year-old Invents Soap for Treating Skin Cancer and Wins Top Honor as America’s Top Young Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that a bacteria’s host environment and interactions with other microbes can influence its susceptibility to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s growing interest in applying microbes as a therapeutic, such as adding bacteria to prevent the growth of a pathogen,” Kowalski said. “But it can have consequences that we have not yet fully understood. Even though we know antibiotics lead to the evolution of resistance, it hasn’t been considered when we think about the application of microbes as a therapeutic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the discovery adds a layer of complexity for drug discovery, Kowalski said she is excited about the potential of resident fungi as a new source for future antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the antimicrobial fatty acids took three years and a cross-disciplinary effort. Kowalski collaborated with chemical microbiologists at McMaster University to track down the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKIN HEALING CURE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="New ‘Super Melanin’ Cream Heals Skin From Sun Exposure And Even Chemical Burns" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/super-melanin-cream-heals-skin-from-sun-and-chemical-burns/" rel="bookmark"&gt;New ‘Super Melanin’ Cream Heals Skin From Sun Exposure And Even Chemical Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was like finding a needle in a haystack but with molecules you can’t see,” said Kowalski’s adviser, Matthew Barber, an associate professor of biology in the College of Arts and Sciences at the UO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kowalski is working on a follow-up study that goes deeper into the genetic mechanisms that led to the antibiotic tolerance. She is also preparing to launch her own lab to further investigate the overlooked role of the skin microbiome, parting from Barber’s lab after bringing fungi into focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a major human health threat and one that, in some ways, is getting worse,” Barber said. “We still have a lot of work to do in understanding the microorganisms but also finding new ways that we can possibly treat or prevent those infections.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now and then, things like stress, illness or injury can trigger it, bringing on a cold sore in some people. But this same virus – called herpes simplex virus type 1 – may also play an important role in something far more serious: Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years ago, my colleagues and I made a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;surprising discovery&lt;/a&gt;. We found that this cold sore virus can be present in the brains of older people. It was the first clear sign that a virus could be quietly living in the brain, which was long thought to be completely germ-free – protected by the so-called “blood-brain barrier”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we discovered something even more striking. People who have a certain version of a gene (called APOE-e4) that increases their risk of Alzheimer’s, and who have been infected with this virus, have a risk that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;many times greater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, we studied brain cells that we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394007010786?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected with the virus&lt;/a&gt;. They produced the same abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that the virus stays mainly dormant in the body for years – possibly decades. But later in life, as the immune system gets weaker, it can enter the brain and reactivate there. When it does, it will damage brain cells and trigger inflammation. Over time, repeated flare-ups could gradually cause the kind of damage that leads to Alzheimer’s in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We later found the virus’s DNA &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18973185/"&gt;inside the sticky clumps of these proteins&lt;/a&gt;, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Even more encouragingly, antiviral treatments reduced this damage in the lab, suggesting that drugs might one day help to slow or even prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956964/"&gt;Large population studies&lt;/a&gt; by others found that severe infections, specifically with the cold sore virus, was a strong predictor of Alzheimer’s, and that specific antiviral treatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34136638/"&gt;reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research didn’t stop there. We &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-220287"&gt;wondered if&lt;/a&gt; other viruses that lie dormant in the body might have similar effects – such as the one responsible for chickenpox and shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles vaccine offers another clue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we studied health records from hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, we saw something interesting. People who had shingles had only a slightly higher risk of developing dementia. Yet those who had the shingles vaccine were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625411/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335"&gt;new Stanford University-led study&lt;/a&gt; gave similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supported our long-held proposal that preventing common infections could lower the risk of Alzheimer’s. Consistently, studies by others showed that infections were indeed a risk and that some other vaccines were protective against Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430"&gt;then explored&lt;/a&gt; how risk factors for Alzheimer’s such as infections and head injuries could trigger the hidden virus in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced 3D model of the brain with a dormant herpes infection, we found that when we introduced other infections or simulated a brain injury, the cold sore virus reactivated and caused damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer’s. But when we used a treatment to reduce inflammation, the virus stayed inactive, and the damage didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that the virus that causes cold sores could be an important contributor to Alzheimer’s, especially in people with certain genetic risk factors. It also opens the door to possible new ways of preventing the disease, such as vaccines or antiviral treatments that stop the virus from waking up and harming the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a link between cold sores and memory loss has grown into a much bigger story – one that may help us understand, and eventually reduce, the risk of one of the most feared diseases of our time.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;time class="date-time" pubdate datetime="2025-05-25" title="Sunday 25 May 2025"&gt;An Hour Ago&lt;/time&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/24117153-e1748203716576.jpg" alt="A screengrab from a Facebook video posted by Nicole Dyer-Griffith on May 25. - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A screengrab from a Facebook video posted by Nicole Dyer-Griffith on May 25. - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FORMER Miss Universe TT Nicole Dyer-Griffith says her latest medical check-up has brought her positive news in respect of her ongoing battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made these comments in video posted on Facebook on May 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith, a former senator, is the wife of former police commissioner/national security minister/National Transformation Alliance (NTA) leader Gary Griffith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, Dyer-Griffith shocked many as she appeared in a video with a bald head to announce she was diagnosed with stage-three inflammatory breast cancer in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a video taken in her vehicle and shared to her social media on March 14, she said she had completed her radiation treatment and was taking hormone suppressants. At a medical check-up, she told her doctors she was getting headaches and, just to be safe, an MRI was scheduled for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those MRI results subsequently showed she had a tumour in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest video, Dyer-Griffith said. "The stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) was completed and went quite well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a precise form of external beam radiation therapy used to treat abnormalities in the brain and spine, including cancer, epilepsy, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It delivers a highly focused dose of radiation to the target area while minimising damage to surrounding healthy tissues. SRS is often a viable alternative to traditional surgery when the tumour is inaccessible or too risky for surgery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added, "I also did my post treatment PET scan which is to see if there is an residue of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan is a medical imaging technique that uses radioactive substances (radiotracers) to visualise and measure changes in metabolic processes within the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scans are helpful in diagnosing and planning treatment for various conditions, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith smiled as she said,"Thus far it was clear. So from stage-three breast cancer to stage-four brain cancer to a clear PET scan...God is absolutely fabulous."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She acknowledged this is a journey and challenges lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith said she was confidently taking this journey, one step at a time and one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told other people facing similar challenges that they remained in her thoughts and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;

Compared to non-practitioners, BDSM participants were more likely to have secure attachment styles, lower rejection sensitivity, and higher levels of well-being. These findings challenge the persistent social stigma that often links BDSM with emotional dysfunction or psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to replicate and extend the work of a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jsm.12192" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study by Wismeijer and Van Assen&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that BDSM practitioners showed more functional psychological traits than non-practitioners. Despite the social stigma surrounding BDSM—an umbrella term encompassing practices involving consensual power exchange, sensation play, and role-play—the original study found no evidence of psychological harm associated with these sexual interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the field lacked high-powered replication studies, especially outside of Western European countries. To address this gap, the researchers set out to test whether the original findings held true in a large, diverse Spanish sample and to explore additional factors such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and depth of BDSM experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct this study, the researchers recruited 1,884 Spanish adults through social media, online networks, and a sex toy retailer’s newsletter. About 60% of participants identified as BDSM practitioners, while the remaining 40% did not. The sample was diverse in terms of gender and sexual orientation: 58% were cisgender women, 35% cisgender men, and 6% identified as transgender or gender non-conforming. Over half identified as part of the LGBTQIA+ community. Participants were between the ages of 18 and 68, with a median age of 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a series of validated self-report questionnaires that assessed their personality traits (based on the Big Five model), attachment styles, rejection sensitivity, and subjective well-being. They were also asked about their BDSM practices, including their roles (dominant, submissive, switch), experiences related to power or pain dynamics (top, bottom, switch), and the frequency of their engagement in BDSM activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a series of statistical analyses to compare BDSM practitioners with non-practitioners. They controlled for demographic factors such as age, gender, and education. They also explored whether specific roles within BDSM (e.g., dominant vs. submissive) were associated with unique psychological patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results strongly supported the original 2013 findings. BDSM practitioners were more likely than non-practitioners to report secure attachment styles, particularly among those who identified as dominants. These individuals also had higher scores on conscientiousness and openness to experience, and lower scores on neuroticism and rejection sensitivity—traits often linked to emotional stability and interpersonal effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the differences were not uniform across all roles, dominants consistently showed the most functional psychological profiles. They reported higher extraversion and well-being, and lower neuroticism and rejection sensitivity, especially among women. Submissives and switches generally fell in between dominants and non-practitioners on most measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, BDSM practitioners also reported higher levels of well-being, with dominants again standing out as the most satisfied group. This supports prior research suggesting that BDSM, for many, is not simply a set of sexual practices but also a source of empowerment, connection, and self-expression. Practitioners with more experience in BDSM reported even greater psychological benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important finding was that the psychological structure—how attachment styles, personality traits, and well-being relate to one another—was consistent across both BDSM practitioners and non-practitioners. This suggests that while BDSM practitioners may differ in levels of certain traits, the basic architecture of their psychological functioning is no different from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that sexual orientation and gender identity played a role in shaping psychological characteristics. For example, bi/pansexual individuals tended to report lower discomfort with emotional closeness compared to other groups, and transgender and gender non-conforming individuals scored higher on openness and rejection sensitivity. These intersections point to the importance of considering broader social contexts and minority stress when interpreting psychological data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers emphasized that their findings contradict the outdated notion that BDSM is a sign of psychological damage or deviance. While BDSM has historically been pathologized—often viewed as the result of childhood trauma or emotional dysfunction—the data did not support this view. Instead, BDSM appears to be a variation of healthy sexual expression, often associated with traits that promote personal and relational well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study was not without its limitations. Its cross-sectional design means that causal relationships cannot be determined. For instance, it remains unclear whether engaging in BDSM leads to greater well-being or whether individuals with certain psychological traits are more drawn to BDSM. The researchers also used self-reported data, which can be subject to bias. Additionally, the sample was not representative of the broader population, given its reliance on self-selection and social networks for recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers compelling evidence that BDSM practitioners are psychologically well-adjusted individuals. It reinforces the need for healthcare professionals, educators, and the public to reconsider harmful stereotypes and assumptions about kink communities. The researchers call for more replication studies, particularly those that use longitudinal designs and more representative samples, to deepen our understanding of how BDSM fits into the broader landscape of human sexuality and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2024.2364891" target="_blank"&gt;Not Twisted, Just Kinky: Replication and Structural Invariance of Attachment, Personality, and Well-Being Among BDSM Practitioners&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Oscar Lecuona, Olga Martínez-Barajas, Alejandro Gimeno-Martín, Alejandra Hernansaiz, Carla Carrillo-Molina, Rodrigo Alcolea-Cantero, Raquel Rodríguez-Carvajal, and Sara de Rivas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 18:06:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOWU9pSEhVQUV3Ykw2dldRQkFOcHM3dDV4YUp1WkNrUmh0Q1lVQlZ6Q0hZSEtpal9iS3JxMXVpOGxnSXhvWWQ4QlFGdFFoN052NkRDbEhHUXdUdTV2SGVfRmJ6R1N1VlBMdHgwSi1SNF9DSlBuT2NoQm9oWUhFbzd6Ujh1eC02UDh5WWhoZWlhUllVdnljalhlNUMwX0dqNEE</guid></item><item><title>由于疫苗接种率低，科罗拉多州部分地区的麻疹风险与西德克萨斯州一样高-《丹佛邮报》 | Parts of Colorado face measles risk as high as West Texas due to low vaccination rates - The Denver Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOc0ppX1NVWkJDRk5heFFZbnN2VldjLW0zWHAzYzNHMmNNbFI3OEtDS2hnVDI0OHFRNzg5b2xPdW5sMWpaZl82Tlk1TFhCX3FPVWpjbFQ5T0UwSElJUklnUWxTbjlKeEF4cGktM0NFRzhzcWRtVHZQQm9KMFo0UVZVV0RQOHM4U01ieW5UN9IBkgFBVV95cUxQbS1wamZHeldCUHlIaklscDVtWUUzNFo2Z3lSdjhMYkYzRzQ2aTJES1ppeGhuejRTM3RkOXZqanpQUkQ1ak4wZTFuMl9FekFLLVYxZDRsMTlQeGVCQ2ROdjFpMGxySVNpTzk2QUE3WkxSUk1CV3hxUk90RDVFTWVxQlhYMF9FMzBzS2xzTGFBaHBIdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of Colorado are as vulnerable to measles as West Texas, where the highly contagious virus has infected hundreds of people and killed two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded more confirmed measles cases so far this year than it has in almost two decades. Rural pockets of the state are undervaccinated, and large counties have seen their protection erode since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country as a whole has more than three times as many measles cases already this year as it did in all of 2024, and federal health officials are pushing vitamins as an alternative to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think what’s clear is, we’re going backwards,” said Beth Carlton, chair of environmental and occupational health at the &lt;a href="https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/"&gt;Colorado School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re creating conditions where we have the right ingredients for measles to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, about 94% of Colorado students in preschool through 12th grade were up-to-date on their measles shots in the 2023-2024 school year, creating an imperfect but relatively solid wall around people with compromised immune systems and babies too young for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that average conceals more-vulnerable pockets in the state: in two counties, one-quarter of children didn’t have their shots, and in eight schools, less than half did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 25 years, communities typically didn’t see any consequences from those low rates. Measles no longer circulated in the United States, and outbreaks popped up only when travelers brought the virus back. While public health officials warned that declining vaccination rates could set the stage for the virus to start circulating widely again, Colorado reported only six people who had measles &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/measles"&gt;between 2014 and 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those days may be over. As of Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;measles had infected 1,046 people&lt;/a&gt; across the United States, and public health officials have started to worry that the outbreak could last into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has confirmed five measles cases since January, making this the first time since 1996 that the state had more than two in a single year. Those infected include an &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;adult in Pueblo County&lt;/a&gt;; a Denver baby and &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;an unidentified person&lt;/a&gt; who lives in the same household; a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/25/colorado-measles-denver-lakewood-exposure/"&gt;Denver adult&lt;/a&gt;; and an adult in Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials also warned the public last week about two infected and contagious travelers who recently visited Colorado: a person from another state who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/21/measles-pueblo-hotel-holiday-inn/"&gt;stayed at a Pueblo hotel on May 9 and 10&lt;/a&gt;, and an international traveler who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/22/denver-measles-dia-colorado-quality-inn-airport/"&gt;passed through Denver International Airport and stayed at a nearby hotel&lt;/a&gt; on May 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the state’s confirmed measles patients got sick after visiting Mexico, though the &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;Archuleta County adult hadn’t traveled&lt;/a&gt;, which raises concerns about missed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, uptake of routine vaccines &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/155/4/e2024068244/201312/COVID-19-and-Completion-of-Select-Routine"&gt;still hadn’t rebounded from a pandemic dip&lt;/a&gt; as of 2023, and resistance to COVID-19 vaccines led to increased skepticism of shots that once had bipartisan support. State legislatures have considered expanding exemptions to school vaccination requirements or &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/state-lawmakers-see-new-opportunities-to-pass-vaccine-exemptions-after-trumps-return"&gt;forbidding “discrimination” based on being unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, and a bill in Minnesota would have classified one type of vaccine technology as a &lt;a href="https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/24/umn-disease-research-center-to-launch-vaccine-integrity-project/"&gt;“weapon of mass destruction.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the Trump administration have been lukewarm in endorsing the shots as a way to stem the current outbreak. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted misinformation that vaccines cause autism and falsely claimed that vitamin A could prevent measles, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/kennedy-vaccines-research.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Dk8.NeR6.HBiMh-SBxZlz&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;framed vaccination as a personal choice, with no clear correct answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two shots of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection and virtually eliminate the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia and neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At current vaccination rates, a series of simulations published by the Journal of the American Medical Association gave measles an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361?guestAccessKey=5d34848e-bd4f-4cba-ac24-685fadb45a1c&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=postup_jn&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&amp;amp;utm_content=olf&amp;amp;utm_term=042425&amp;amp;utm_adv="&gt;83% chance of reestablishing a permanent presence&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, with an estimated 850,000 cases and 2,500 deaths projected over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rates would only have to rise about 5% to prevent reestablishment and knock cases down to a few thousand in the next quarter century, the scientists running the simulation said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models never reflect reality perfectly, but seeing such a high risk from a simulation that used relatively conservative estimates is worrisome, Carlton said. As outbreaks continue to spread in other states, and possibly in countries that have lost American aid for their health systems, Colorado communities will face an increased risk of imported cases that could turn into outbreaks if they land among undervaccinated people, she said. Essentially, they’ll roll the dice more often, and their luck could eventually run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, parents who weren’t sure about measles shots may opt for them when the virus no longer seems like a far-off risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lauren Brave, a pediatrician in Boulder County, said a few already are starting to make that calculation. Two families in her practice who’d decided not to vaccinate their children against measles recently changed their minds, and others have said they’ll come in for the shots if cases start popping up closer to home, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All parents are just trying to protect their kids, so when people hear scary things online, it plays to their natural parental fears,” she said. “It’s a long game” to get children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Striving for herd immunity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials cite 95% vaccine coverage as the threshold for herd immunity — the point where a virus can’t find new hosts to allow it to jump from one susceptible person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most things in nature, however, herd immunity isn’t quite that clear-cut, said Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist on the &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu/"&gt;University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus&lt;/a&gt;. A community where 90% of children are up-to-date on their measles shots isn’t as protected as one where 95% are, but it is safer than a community where 80% are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a light switch, on or off. It’s more of a dimmer,” he said of vaccination levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 23 large and small counties scattered around Colorado, K-12 students met the herd immunity threshold in the 2023-2024 school year, which was the most recent with data. In the Denver area, Broomfield, Adams and Douglas counties had at least 95% of their students vaccinated against measles, while Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe counties fell between 93% and 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end, in 13 counties, at least one in 10 K-12 students didn’t have full protection against measles, and in Hinsdale and Dolores counties in the state’s southwest corner, more than one in four didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual rates may be lower, because states collect vaccination data through their public schools, and rates tend to be lower for kids attending private schools or who are homeschooled, said Dr. Michelle Fiscus, chief medical officer at the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/"&gt;Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracy Beanland, director of &lt;a href="https://dolocnty.colorado.gov/public-health"&gt;Dolores County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, said last year’s rates don’t reflect progress the county has made since 2023. In the current school year, all children were up to date on their measles shots, she said. The county has about 600 children attending public schools, which makes large swings in the vaccination rate more likely than in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Hinsdale County didn’t respond to questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even county and district averages can conceal unprotected pockets. In Saguache County in the San Luis Valley, about 88% of students were up-to-date on their measles shots, but only 60% were in tiny &lt;a href="https://www.moffatschools.org/"&gt;Moffat School District C-2&lt;/a&gt; — and only 20% were in the district’s &lt;a href="https://www.crestone-charter-school.org/"&gt;Crestone Charter School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable pockets don’t only appear in rural areas. While almost 96% of K-12 students in Adams County had their measles shots, at &lt;a href="https://ebabrighton.org/"&gt;Elmwood Baptist Academy&lt;/a&gt; in Brighton, only 30% did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern existed in Texas. In Gaines County — the epicenter of the current outbreak — about 90% of public school students were up-to-date on their measles vaccine by middle school, but fewer than half of students had their shots in a few individual schools. (Texas only publishes vaccination rates for kindergarteners and seventh graders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities can nudge people who don’t have strong feelings about vaccines in either direction, Higgins said. People who send their children to the same school or child care center tend to have similar media diets, meaning that interacting with other parents can reinforce either facts or misinformation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that social norms within communities are strong motivators for health behavior,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rates drop in large counties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have fallen in Colorado’s larger counties since the 2017-2018 school year, with most of the decline happening since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 counties with at least 50,000 residents, eight saw a statistically significant drop in their K-12 measles vaccination rate. Six remained stable, and Boulder and Garfield counties increased their vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boulder County started working with neighboring counties and the &lt;a href="https://www.bvsd.org/"&gt;Boulder Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.svvsd.org/"&gt;St. Vrain Valley&lt;/a&gt; school districts on measles back in 2019, which was the last time the United States had major outbreaks, said Stephanie Faren, manager of the communicable disease and emergency management division at &lt;a href="https://bouldercounty.gov/departments/public-health/"&gt;Boulder County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90.7% of students across Boulder County had their measles shots during the 2017-2018 school year, but in the most recent year, 94.9% did, putting herd immunity in reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the improvement was on paper, as the department got a more accurate count of children who’d received their shots, but part represented a real change, Faren said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminding parents when their children were due for shots was an effective measure, because measles just wasn’t top of mind for everyone, Faren said. The health departments also worked with health care providers so they’d feel prepared to field their patients’ questions and concerns, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boulder was one of the first areas where vaccine hesitancy and sort of a natural health movement started,” she said. “But it’s also a highly educated community with a lot of health-minded people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arapahoe and El Paso counties had the steepest drops in vaccination rates among the large Colorado counties, to about 93% and 90%, respectively. (Rural counties see more fluctuation because of their small populations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Durbin, immunization and travel division manager at &lt;a href="https://www.elpasocountyhealth.org/"&gt;El Paso County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, said parents delayed routine health care during the pandemic. The department has been sending reminders to families that are behind on shots and offering vaccine clinics at schools and community organizations, to make it easier to catch up, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EPCPH saw many 13-year-olds coming in for vaccines they should have received around 11, or 6- and 7-year-olds who missed their kindergarten routine immunizations, which includes the (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;“Make it as convenient as possible”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some families fell behind on shots because they have difficulty finding a provider who stocks all the vaccines their children need, said Kaitlin Wolff, immunization nurse manager for &lt;a href="https://www.arapahoeco.gov/your_county/county_departments/public_health_department/index.php"&gt;Arapahoe County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve also seen an increase in parents who aren’t opposed to vaccines, but want to set their own schedule — though that trend may be reversing now that they’re hearing about children hospitalized because of measles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t have a disease circulating, a slight delay presents no problem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arapahoe County’s health department has worked with schools for years to bring the shots to children whose parents don’t have the time or transportation to take them to a doctor, Wolff said. They’ve also reached out to religious communities and partnered with community health workers, who help people in specific populations to navigate the health system, to reach immigrants who speak a language other than English or Spanish, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As humans, we are most impacted (in our decisions) by people close to us,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines may not be a family’s top priority, so some of the most successful efforts bring the shots to places that are already meeting their other needs, said Sarah Waraniak, program director of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizecolorado.org/"&gt;Immunize Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the group and its partners gave out about 7,300 shots at more than 70 clinics around the Denver area, including a food box distribution site off Colfax Avenue and “community baby showers” where low-income mothers-to-be can pick up gear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make it as convenient as possible,” Waraniak said. “We find that does tend to drive rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right strategies to boost vaccination rates will depend on families’ reasons for not getting their children vaccinated, said Fiscus, with the Association of Immunization Managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreach geared toward specific religious groups, such as Orthodox Jews in New York or the Amish community in Pennsylvania, has helped persuade members to accept the vaccine during outbreaks. In other places, such as Chicago, offering vaccine clinics during the school day helped catch kids up, because parents didn’t have to worry about taking time off work or finding transportation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really have to be using micro-level data and planning,” Fiscus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal funding cuts to public health will limit state and local agencies’ ability to do that sort of work, though, said Carlton, with the Colorado School of Public Health. So will the &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/19/cu-anschutz-colorado-research-nih-grants-vaccines-alzheimers/"&gt;Trump administration’s decision to end federal support&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/05/denver-vaccine-hesitancy-study-stopped-trump/"&gt;research on vaccine hesitancy and trust&lt;/a&gt;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like it is the elephant in the room,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You’d have a hard time finding any serious endurance athlete in 2025 who thinks protein doesn’t matter. Gone are the carb-centric days of pasta and Gatorade and nothing else. But figuring out how much protein runners, cyclists, and other endurance junkies actually need—and when they need it—remains a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve grappled with these questions a few times recently—in a piece &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/new-rules-of-protein/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;busting some common protein myths&lt;/a&gt;, and in another discussing the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/how-much-protein-after-workout/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;maximum protein &lt;/a&gt;intake. But now a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40117058/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;new review paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Sports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, from a research team led by Oliver Witard of King’s College London, offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge. Witard and his colleagues focus on two key questions. First, how much protein do endurance athletes need on a daily basis to stay healthy and optimize long-term training adaptations? And second, what role can the tactical use of protein play in speeding up short-term recovery and boosting performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protein for the Long Term&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government guidelines currently recommend getting at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) each day. For someone who weighs 150 pounds, that works out to 55 grams of protein. For reference, a standard 5-ounce can of tuna has about 20 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main problems with this guideline, however. First, it’s intended to be the minimum required to stay healthy, not the optimal amount to maximize performance. Second, it was formulated using a measurement technique that involves tracking the amount of nitrogen being consumed and excreted from the body, which some scientists believe underestimates protein needs. A newer approach called the “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18203885/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;indicator amino acid oxidation method&lt;/a&gt;,” which involves labeling one specific type of amino acid with a carbon isotope to see how quickly it’s burned, gives higher numbers and is also more practical for testing specific populations like athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual argument for getting lots of protein is that it provides the building blocks—amino acids—for building new muscle. That’s important for strength training, but endurance athletes need it for other reasons. One is that these building blocks are used to repair the muscle damage incurred by hard training: the longer and harder you run, the more damage you incur, and more protein you presumably need for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During prolonged exercise, your body also starts burning amino acids for fuel. The amounts are generally small, and how much you burn depends on the nature of the exercise and what else you’re eating, but in some cases 5 to 10 percent of the fuel you need for a given workout is provided by protein. If you’re training hard, you’ll need to eat extra protein to replace those losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some more subtle possibilities, too. Muscle isn’t the only part of the body that’s built from protein. One of the key adaptations athletes gain from endurance training is an increase in the amount of protein in the mitochondria, where cellular energy is generated. The more protein in the mitochondria, the more efficiently it creates energy. A few studies have sought to  figure out whether eating more protein boosts the mitochondrial response to exercise. The results so far haven’t been convincing, but it’s still an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witard and his colleagues pooled data from various indicator amino acid studies to assess protein needs for endurance athletes under various conditions. Here are some of the key numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2704896" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2704896" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/protein-needs.png?width=730" alt="bar graph showing protein needs for endurance athletes" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/protein-needs.png?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/protein-needs.png?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption "&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Data from indicator amino acid studies suggests that endurance athletes need more protein than untrained people.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Adapted from Sports Medicine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator amino acid data suggests that even untrained people need about 1.2 g/kg of protein per day, 50 percent more than the FDA’s recommended daily intake of 0.8 g/kg. And endurance athletes need another 50 percent more than untrained people, with a level of 1.8 g/k/g ensuring that 95 percent of people are getting all the protein their bodies can use. In comparison, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37573015/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; using the same indicator amino acid method find that resistance-trained athletes need somewhere between 1.5 and 2.0 g/kg per day, raising the possibility that endurance athletes might actually need &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; protein than lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an important point to bear in mind, though: endurance athletes also tend to eat a lot more than the average person, which means they automatically get more protein. &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2017_March%202020.pdf" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Current protein intake&lt;/a&gt; among American adults averages 1.25 g/kg for men and 1.09 g/kg for women, pretty close to the overall target of 1.2 g/kg for untrained people. In comparison, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27710150/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that endurance athletes average 1.4 to 1.5 g/kg—not quite at the 1.8 g/kg level, but not that far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other nuances in that graph. Data on male-female differences is very sparse, but there are some hints that women might require more than men relative to their body weight. That might be particularly true during the luteal phase of the &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/how-your-menstrual-cycle-affects-recovery-from-training/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, since progesterone can affect protein burning. Witard and his colleagues make a blanket recommendation that both male and female endurance athletes should aim for 1.8 g/kg, but they throw in the speculative possibility that females “may consider” upping it to 1.9 g/kg during the luteal phase of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short-Term Protein Tactics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big surprise in the data above is that endurance athletes seem to use more protein on their rest days than on training days. This finding has popped up in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38603808/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;a few studies&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s definitely not what the scientists were expecting. It’s possible that there’s some quirk of metabolism that’s skewing the measurements used to assess protein needs when you try to compare exercise and non-exercise days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also possible that the effect is real—that when you give your body a break, its repair and adaptation mechanisms &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/hungrier-on-rest-days/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;kick into overdrive&lt;/a&gt; and thus use more protein than usual. If this is true, it’s an argument for upping your protein intake on rest days: Witard and co. suggest aiming for 2.0 g/kg. And on a more fundamental level, it’s an argument for including true rest days in your training program periodically, since they seem to trigger recovery processes that don’t happen on normal training days. At this point, I’d say the jury is still out on whether the effect is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the researchers suggest aiming for 0.5 g/kg of protein following exercise to help repair any muscle damage incurred during the workout. For a 150-pound person, that’s 34 grams of protein, which is what you’d get in a substantial meal with a good protein source. How soon is “after exercise”? I don’t think there’s any convincing data that says it has to be immediately after. Your next meal is fine—unless your workout was after dinner and you’re planning to head to bed, in which case you should make a special effort to get some protein in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also suggests that athletes use more protein when they’re training in a carbohydrate-depleted state. In this case, we’re not talking about a consistently low-carb diet, but rather doing certain training sessions in a low-carb state to help the body adapt to burning fat more efficiently. There’s decent evidence that protein can help power these workouts, and Witard suggests taking in 10 to 20 grams of protein before and/or during this type of session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of using protein to compensate for low carbs also connects to one of the most hotly debated ideas about protein for endurance athletes. There have been various research-backed claims over the years that adding protein to a sports drink that you consume during a race or training session will enhance your performance, and that taking in some protein in the immediate post-workout window will speed up the rate at which you refill the carbohydrate stores in your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these claims, Witard and his colleagues argue, are the result of studies where the subjects didn’t get enough carbohydrates. If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/carbs-maximize-endurance/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;meeting your carb needs&lt;/a&gt;, adding protein to a sports drink will neither boost your performance nor accelerate your muscle refueling. There may be exceptions for ultra-endurance events, which haven’t been well-studied and have somewhat different metabolic challenges compared to a marathon. But the researchers’ final conclusion is a reminder that for endurance athletes, despite protein’s current popularity, carbohydrate is still king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The CDC Isn't Warning the Public Like It Was Months Ago - KQED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOSmx2RDBXazV5U2FRQXM4U1JZbHZFNExqUTR6VUs1NXFScWYtTzZHQmRrX2l1SDFXYlVtQnBYZnNKbnZKaWlWbFprWllZR2hteFEyUkFYd01ka3VzMm50WWNkcEp2ZnlpbkJEcUxPRVBDY2h3OENILWZsY1RpbXhQVEpPenhlSmktVlIwNGVaTG15NFNvVW9JdFNQWE9WRFZyR0pxbm1sZE1jRkhFMTR5RHlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 24, some employees were sent an email from a supervisor that confirmed that HHS now owned the CDC’s main social media platforms, including its X, Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were also notified that HHS is not accepting content for those channels at this time,” the email added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment regarding the changes to communication practices at the CDC, the director of communications at HHS, Andrew Nixon, cast doubt on what the workers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unfortunate to see career officials spreading false rumors,” Nixon replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since HHS approval was instituted as a requirement for posting, almost no newsletters have been sent to the tens of thousands of people who subscribe to them, CDC workers said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Findex.html"&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt; sent out by the CDC’s Health Alert Network was regarding the risk of dengue infection on March 18, even though outbreaks of salmonella and listeria were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; in May by the CDC on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CDC publications have gone out, some have been delayed or missing information. A recent release of CDC data regarding the prevalence of HIV in the U.S. cautioned that it “does not include data on PrEP coverage,” referring to medication taken by individuals to prevent HIV infection. “CDC is unable to resume PrEP coverage at this time, due to a reduction in force affecting the Division of HIV Prevention (DHP).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two CDC employees who work in communications told NPR that fewer than half of the public health posts they’ve sent to HHS for approval have been cleared for publication on social media. Even posts that include basic information about recent disease outbreaks, like the number of people sickened or hospitalized, have not been posted as requested by employees, NPR confirmed after reviewing posts submitted for approval by an employee. Communications workers say they are also suggesting fewer health posts because they anticipate that their posts will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything is getting bottlenecked at the top,” said a worker. “It is extraordinarily time-consuming and backlogs us by weeks, if not months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences could be deadly, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have an outbreak of something like listeria, if you are a person who is pregnant and you consume food items that might have listeria in it that CDC should be warning you about, you run the risk of the baby that you are carrying dying,” said Guest. “And so that information needs to get out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘Propaganda’ instead of public health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 1, thousands of federal health workers were laid off as part of the government’s “reduction in force.” Communication professionals at the CDC were not spared. Almost everyone at the CDC whose primary job was to communicate with the press was laid off, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/03/g-s1-57888/hhs-fda-rfk-foia-public-records"&gt;almost everyone&lt;/a&gt; whose job it was to provide records to the public. Every member of the CDC’s division of digital media was also told their jobs would be eliminated, workers at the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the points of contact that we generally rely on to communicate with the American people have either been eliminated or dramatically reduced,” said Griffis, the former CDC communications director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing all the CDC’s web developers, graphic designers and social media staffers simultaneously caused a problem. The CDC was suddenly locked out of its main social media accounts, said three people close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The passwords to those accounts were kept on a password protected Word doc,” said one worker at the CDC. “And that Word doc was inaccessible for anyone left, because all of the people that could have opened that document were fired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the main accounts haven’t posted since the CDC’s digital media team was laid off. During March, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/cdc/"&gt;main Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; posted more than 20 times — sometimes twice a day. The posts included information for pregnant women about how to take care of their developing babies and screenings for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only main CDC account that has posted some content since April 1 is the CDC’s account on X, a platform owned by Elon Musk. He oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, the organization that spearheaded efforts to lay off tens of thousands of workers across federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 7, workers at the CDC said they were surprised to see the CDC’s main X account post a tweet for the first time in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KQED</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 17:00:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOSmx2RDBXazV5U2FRQXM4U1JZbHZFNExqUTR6VUs1NXFScWYtTzZHQmRrX2l1SDFXYlVtQnBYZnNKbnZKaWlWbFprWllZR2hteFEyUkFYd01ka3VzMm50WWNkcEp2ZnlpbkJEcUxPRVBDY2h3OENILWZsY1RpbXhQVEpPenhlSmktVlIwNGVaTG15NFNvVW9JdFNQWE9WRFZyR0pxbm1sZE1jRkhFMTR5RHlB</guid></item><item><title>男子在罕见医疗案件中窒息打喷嚏和流泪-印度国防评论 | Man Stifles Sneeze and Tears Windpipe in Rare Medical Case - Indian Defence Review</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5Hc1FrUFBZU3RtM01mUkNVMnJBZllqS1diSDhQUV9YU2hjcDE5Tkk4eHJoRTdFT1BLWFNlT0NZbG5sOFNBNFpXQkIzaDVHei10RklXWHBKZk40TkVhNlhQRGVCdlN5SHpJNll3YlVuc0FRcExhdGlSdGR0SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man in his 30s from the United Kingdom experienced an unusual and medically rare complication after attempting to suppress a sneeze while behind the wheel.  Struggling with hay fever symptoms, he pinched his nose and closed his mouth to contain the reflex, an action that appeared harmless but resulted in a serious internal injury. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-man-held-in-a-sneeze-and-it-punctured-his-windpipe" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-man-held-in-a-sneeze-and-it-punctured-his-windpipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this maneuver led to a spontaneous rupture of his &lt;em&gt;windpipe&lt;/em&gt;, an outcome rarely observed without external trauma. The event initiated a cascade of clinical investigations and raised concerns among doctors about the hidden dangers of interfering with such a natural reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symptoms and Initial Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient arrived at the emergency department with &lt;em&gt;severe neck pain&lt;/em&gt;, a visibly &lt;em&gt;swollen neck&lt;/em&gt;, and he reported he could &lt;em&gt;barely move his neck&lt;/em&gt; due to discomfort. Despite these symptoms, he was able to &lt;em&gt;breathe, swallow, and speak normally&lt;/em&gt;. Upon physical examination, physicians noted a &lt;em&gt;faint crackling sound&lt;/em&gt;—a clinical sign indicating that &lt;em&gt;air had escaped into soft tissues&lt;/em&gt;. Initial &lt;em&gt;X-rays&lt;/em&gt; revealed &lt;em&gt;surgical emphysema&lt;/em&gt;, a condition where air is trapped under the skin’s deepest tissue layers.  A follow-up &lt;em&gt;CT scan&lt;/em&gt; showed a &lt;em&gt;small perforation (2 mm by 2 mm, or 0.08 x 0.08 inches)&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;trachea&lt;/em&gt;, specifically between the &lt;em&gt;third and fourth cervical vertebrae (C3–C4)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tear allowed air to escape from the trachea into the surrounding tissues and into the mediastinum. According to the physicians’ report, the rupture was caused by a “rapid build-up of pressure in the &lt;em&gt;trachea&lt;/em&gt; while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth.” This intense pressure likely caused a tear in the &lt;em&gt;windpipe&lt;/em&gt;, allowing air to escape into surrounding tissues. Estimates suggest this action can create pressures more than 20 times higher than those generated during a typical “achoo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hospital Treatment and Follow-Up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors opted against surgery, instead placing the patient under close observation for &lt;em&gt;two days&lt;/em&gt;. During this period, he was &lt;em&gt;not permitted to eat or drink&lt;/em&gt; for the first 24 hours and was monitored for vital signs and oxygen saturation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was later discharged with &lt;em&gt;pain relief&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hay fever medications&lt;/em&gt;, and advised to &lt;em&gt;avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;five-week follow-up CT scan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed that the tear had &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;completely healed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Sneeze That Led to an Unexpected Medical Emergency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous tracheal tears are &lt;em&gt;rarely reported in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/after-a-knee-surgery-this-teenager-wakes-up-speaking-a-foreign-language-and-has-forgotten-his-mother-tongue/" data-type="post" data-id="77052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medical literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Previous documented cases were typically linked to &lt;em&gt;external trauma&lt;/em&gt;, or occurred as &lt;em&gt;complications from medical interventions&lt;/em&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;thyroidectomy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;intubation&lt;/em&gt;.  To the authors’ knowledge, no prior cases have involved tracheal rupture solely due to stifling a sneeze. In their report, the doctors issued a direct warning, stating: “&lt;em&gt;Everyone should be advised not to stifle sneezes by pinching the nose while keeping the mouth closed as it can result in tracheal perforation.&lt;/em&gt;” This case illustrates how everyday actions, when done improperly, can lead to unexpected and medically significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the actual purpose of the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; is not to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/how-ozempic-works-weight-loss-520663-20250429"&gt;take numbers off scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ozempic.com/why-ozempic/what-is-ozempic.html"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; the official website, Ozempic 'is not a weight loss drug' and is supposed to be 'a medicine for adults with Type-2 diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The drug, which is usually prescribed as an injectable medicine, is meant to be used 'along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar (glucose) in adults with type 2 diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's been designed to 'reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in adults with type 2 diabetes with known heart disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Two doctors have issued a warning about the alleged side effects of Ozempic (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, Ozempic has been making headlines in recent months after people - including &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; in both &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; - have been using it solely for weight loss purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And now, Dr Emma Cunningham and Dr Sepideh Jalali have claimed that patients who are using Ozempic are reporting various issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Cunningham, an advanced aesthetics specialist at Dr Emma Clinics, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/35047628/brutal-ozempic-aftermath-celebs-secretly-have-it/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Sun that her customers have experienced something known as 'GLP-1 Face'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It relates to concerns surrounding loose skin in the face and body area, believed to be part of the 'Ozempic aftermath'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Medical professionals have issued a brutal warning about a possible 'Ozempic aftermath' (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Fat loss in the face, torso, and arms can leave the skin looking loose and deflated," she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Although some might think this is a positive outlook on successful results, it can leave individuals feeling self-conscious about their appearance as their natural body contours are no longer there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Sepideh, a dentist at The Tooth Club, added that 'GLP-1 causes changes in the way food is processed by the stomach'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As well as causing nausea, she said: "Many are unaware that a hidden side effect of changing dietary habits and the body's reaction to meditation can cause dry mouth, which can lead to plaque buildup and a high risk of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic is supposed to be 'a medicine for adults with Type-2 diabetes' (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Being linked to 'Ozempic face' inducing changes to the mouth, teeth, gums and surrounding facial structures due to the rapid weight loss in the fat pads in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The drop is caused by skin sagging, creating an appearance of hollow cheeks or a prematurely aged look."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, if you want to see an actual visualisation of what using Ozempic can look like, Zack D. Films has got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Over on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the content creator has &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8wiA0fpnivE"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; a simulation video of what sort of side effects come with taking Ozempic medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Once Ozempic is in your bloodstream, it activates the parts of the brain that make you feel full, reducing your appetite," he said in the clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It also stabilises your blood sugar, stopping sudden cravings. Then it slows down how fast your stomach empties food, which keeps you feeling full for longer after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"This causes you to lose weight as you eat less. But it can make some people feel sick and even give them diarrhoea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;LADbible Group has contacted Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 16:37:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNb082NFcyUy15eUZnbERxYXBwMTY1SVBwWWQzRVAwTmtDSGFCSHpodUdFNnB5SzZ0NjM4dlA1bXBIeDh3bTlGWTQtWDZ6RHVuQllRb3dxc0ZLREpHazVvS3BUekRYLTdnSTJmWTNoN1RTQ01WeEJNNXZZbGVJX2xZNWZGdFc1Y0ZHdzgyZ25jckY1dDd1UnVfWWZScHRrNDR1UzllMGdzWUdwZzFBeENJ</guid></item></channel></rss>
