			&lt;p&gt;The number of people being diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ASD)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ADHD)&lt;/span&gt; has risen sharply in recent decades, and research continues to look at factors involved in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2023 revealed there's a difference in how children with &lt;span&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; clear the common plastic compound bisphenol A (BPA), compared to neurotypical children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA is used in a lot of plastics and plastic production processes, and can also be found inside food and drink cans. However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hormone-disrupting-chemical-detected-in-90-of-europeans-research-shows"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has also linked it to health issues involving hormone disruption, including breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163645" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150231" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642.jpg" alt="plastic water bottles" class="wp-image-150231 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150231" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plastic bottles can contain the additive bisphenol A. (&lt;a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/bottles-plastic-recycling-4276208/"&gt;fotoblend/pixabay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rowan University and Rutgers University in the US looked at three groups of children: 66 with &lt;span&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt;, 46 with &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;, and 37 neurotypical kids. In particular, they analyzed the process of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronidation"&gt;glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical process the body uses to clear out toxins within the blood through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that kids with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; couldn't clear out BPA and another similar compound called &lt;a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1750368/"&gt;diethylhexyl phthalate&lt;/a&gt; (DEHP) with as much efficiency as other kids, potentially leading to longer exposure to their toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Detoxification of these two plasticizers is compromised in children with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "Consequently, their tissues are more exposed to these two plasticizers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only in the case of BPA that the difference was  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="163645" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; though: the efficiency was reduced by about 11 percent for kids with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and 17 percent for kids with &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;, compared with the control group of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that gene mutations in certain individuals mean that BPA can't be cleared as well as it needs to be, which means the substance sticks around in the body. That potentially could cause damage in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-brain-reveals-the-genetic-origins-of-autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;neuron development&lt;/a&gt; and operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150233" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642.jpg" alt="neuron image" class="wp-image-150233 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150233" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Inability to clear BPA in some individuals could affect the development of their neurons.

However, it's only part of the story – not every child with a neurodevelopmental disorder had problems flushing out BPA, so there are other factors at play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is continuing to identify how exactly &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-presents-in-different-forms-which-scientists-still-can-t-fully-explain"&gt;develop in people&lt;/a&gt; – whether it's in utero before birth for example, or later on in life – as the data isn't enough to show whether BPA exposure causes either disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an extensive body of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33004-1/fulltext"&gt;epidemiological evidence&lt;/a&gt; for a relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and environmental pollutants such as plasticizers," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the researchers &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How important plasticizer originated neurodevelopmental disorder is in the overall occurrence of these disorders is not known, but it must account for a significant proportion or would not have been so easy to detect in a metabolic study of moderate size such as this study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in October 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that the fusiform gyrus—a region involved in visual processing—plays a key role in telling reality from imagination, especially when we mentally picture something vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI, the team showed that strong activation in this area could lead people to misinterpret imagined images as real, particularly when imagining vivid visual patterns. These findings shed light on how the brain separates internal and external experiences—and how this process may break down in disorders like schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusiform Gyrus Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong activation in this visual area increases the chance of mistaking imagined images for real ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagination Can Override Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; When mental images are vivid, the brain may treat them like real perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal Cortex Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior insula helps evaluate whether an experience is imagined or real, working with the fusiform gyrus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of the brain that help a person differentiate between what is real and what is imaginary have been uncovered in a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, found that a region in the brain known as the fusiform gyrus – located behind one’s temples, on the underside of the brain’s temporal lobe – is involved in helping the brain to determine whether what we see is from the external world or generated by our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110705"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and an apple." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also showed that the fusiform gyrus collaborates with other brain areas to help us decide what is real and what is imagined. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that their findings will increase understanding of the cognitive processes that go awry when someone has difficulty judging what is real and what is not, such as in schizophrenia, and could eventually lead to advancement in diagnosing and treating these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Nadine Dijkstra (Department of Imaging Neuroscience at UCL) said: “Imagine an apple in your mind’s eye as vividly as you can. During imagination, many of the same brain regions activate in the same manner as when you see a real apple. Until recently, it remained unclear how the brain distinguishes between these real and imagined experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers asked 26 participants to look at simple visual patterns while imagining them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, participants were asked to look for a specific faint pattern within a noisy background on a screen and indicate whether the pattern was actually present or not. A real pattern was only presented half of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, participants were also instructed to imagine a pattern that was either the same or different to the one they were looking for, and indicate how vivid their mental images were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the patterns were the same, and participants reported that their imagination was very vivid, they were more likely to say they saw a real pattern, even on trials in which nothing was presented. This means they mistook their mental images for reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants performed the tasks, their brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This technology enabled the researchers to identify which parts of the brain showed patterns of activity that helped distinguish reality from imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the strength of activity in the fusiform gyrus could predict whether people judged an experience as real or imagined, irrespective of whether it actually was real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When activity in the fusiform gyrus was strong, people were more likely to indicate that the pattern was really there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, activation in the fusiform gyrus is weaker during imagination than during perception, which helps the brain keep the two apart. However, this study showed that sometimes when participants imagined very vividly, activation of the fusiform gyrus was very strong and participants confused their imagination for reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Professor Steve Fleming (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences) said: “The brain activity in this area of visual cortex matched the predictions from a computer simulation on how the difference between internally and externally generated experience is determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dijkstra added: “Our findings suggest that the brain uses the strength of sensory signals to distinguish between imagination and reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the fusiform gyrus collaborates with other brain areas to help us decide what is real and what is imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, activity in the anterior insula – a brain region in the prefrontal cortex (the front part of the brain that acts as a control centre for tasks such as decision making, problem solving and planning) – increased in line with activity in the fusiform gyrus when participants said something was real, even if it was in fact imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Fleming said: “These areas of the prefrontal cortex have previously been implicated in metacognition – the ability to think about our own minds. Our results indicate that the same brain areas are also involved in deciding what is real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results offer new insights into what might go wrong in the brain during psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia where patients struggle keeping apart imagination and reality.

              &lt;p&gt;Snake oil salesmen will be eating good during the Trump presidency. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently declared that he will greatly expand people’s access to experimental and alternative medical treatments, even while acknowledging that a “lot of charlatans” are likely to take advantage of suffering people as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.theultimatehuman.com/podcast-episodes/robert-f-kennedy-jr-how-to-fix-americas-health-crisis-as-hhs-secretary"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; the announcement during a recent interview on the Ultimate Human Podcast hosted by Gary Brecka, a self-proclaimed biologist, biohacker, and longevity expert (Brecka appears to &lt;a href="https://agemed.org/cme-conferences/florida-april-2020/faculty/gary-brecka-human-biologist/#:~:text=Gary%20has%20a%20BS%20in%20Biology%20from%20Frostburg%20State%20University%20and%20a%E2%80%AF%E2%80%AFBS%20in%20Human%20Biology%20from%20National%20College%20of%20Chiropractic."&gt;possess&lt;/a&gt; two bachelors’ degrees in biology, but is not a licensed medical doctor). Kennedy stated that, under his reign as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Americans will more easily be able to get their hands on treatments not currently approved by health regulators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you want to take an experimental drug—you can do that, you ought to be able to do that,” Kennedy told Brecka.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While many patient advocates in general have pushed for looser regulations surrounding experimental or off-label treatments, other experts have &lt;a href="https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20200303/right-to-try-a-wellintentioned-but-misguided-law"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; that it’s important to strike a balance between improved access and safety. And it’s unlikely Kennedy’s approach will meet that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-thought-anti-vax-was-bad-these-are-rfk-jr-s-most-disturbing-beliefs-about-health-2000524995"&gt;long spread misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines (one of the most effective medical interventions ever created), nutrition, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-spews-even-more-nonsense-on-autism-covid-in-latest-interview-2000592116"&gt;other health topics&lt;/a&gt;. And he’s no stranger to backing &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; that have next to no evidence supporting their use. During this latest interview, for instance, he referenced chelation and stem cells as unproven therapies that people should have easier access to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stem cell medicine is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/groundbreaking-stem-cell-therapy-repairs-badly-damaged-corneas-and-improves-sight-2000571015"&gt;legitimate and growing field&lt;/a&gt; of research. But direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics often exaggerate their benefits, claiming stem cells can treat everything from cancer to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/stem-cell-therapy-clinics-long-covid-risks-cost-1850967572"&gt;long covid&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, this cottage industry has exploded in the U.S. and overseas, and some patients have been severely injured from buying into the hype. People have experienced pulmonary embolisms, bacterial infections, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shady-stem-cell-therapies-can-cause-tumors-infections-1844543918"&gt;other serious complications&lt;/a&gt;, including blindness, from visiting these clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The risk-balance equation is arguably even worse with chelation therapy. Chelation involves using drugs that bind to heavy metals in the body, allowing them to be excreted out through urine. It’s an effective treatment for certain kinds of acute poisoning or toxic exposures. But in alternative medicine circles, &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical/study-gets-heart-controversial-chelation-therapy"&gt;chelation&lt;/a&gt; is regularly used to “cleanse” people of supposed toxins dubiously blamed for a bevy of chronic illnesses, including autism. As with stem cells, people have gotten hurt or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5508a3.htm"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; after taking chelation for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK seems to be fully aware of the potential danger that would come with making these treatments easier to access, yet brushed that off as inevitable during his interview.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“And of course you’re going to get a lot of charlatans, and you’re going to get people who have bad results,” he said. “And ultimately, you can’t prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has previously warned the public to stay away from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism#:~:text=These%20products%20claim,life%2Dthreatening%20outcomes."&gt;chelation therapy for autism&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism"&gt;unregulated stem cell treatments&lt;/a&gt;, but who knows if these warnings will stay up for much longer. Kennedy and the Trump Administration have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/moderna-pulls-promising-covid-flu-combo-shot-as-rfk-continues-antivax-campaign-2000606078"&gt;repeatedly undermined&lt;/a&gt; approved medical treatments like vaccines. Now he’s set to open the floodgates for unlicensed drugs that may not work or will harm people desperate enough to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

						Four cases of suspected botulism linked to cosmetic injections are being investigated on the South Shore, according to an advisory from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.The cases are linked to cosmetic botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, injections, which are widely used for cosmetic purposes to reduce wrinkles and fine lines. "While generally safe when administered by trained professionals, improper dosing, administration technique, or use of non-FDA-approved products may increase the risk of systemic botulism symptoms," the Mass DPH’s advisory said. Botulism is a rare, and sometimes fatal, disease caused by botulinum toxin. Initial botulism symptoms can include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing. These symptoms could be followed by a descending, symmetric muscle weakness that progresses over hours to days.Anyone who is experiencing any of these symptoms should immediately go to the emergency room.

Nearly all (97.5%) were taking semaglutide, while 2.5% were on lixisenatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study did not exclude any specific brand of drugs, but since Wegovy was only approved in Canada in November 2021, primarily for weight loss, it is likely the bulk of semaglutide users in the study were taking Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Each patient on semaglutide or lixisenatide was matched with two patients who also had diabetes but were not taking the drugs, who shared similar characteristics such as age, gender and health conditions. The researchers then compared how many patients developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found that those who had been taking semaglutide or lixisenatide for at least six months had twice the risk of developing macular degeneration, compared with similar patients who were not taking the drugs. Patients who had been taking GLP-1 RAs for more than 30 months had more than three times the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diabetic patients who were older and/or had had a stroke had an even higher risk of developing macular degeneration if they were on these drugs, the authors found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Marko Popovic, a co-author of the study and physician in the department of ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Toronto, said: “GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have multiple effects on the eye, and in the case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the overall impact may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Based on our data, I would advise exercising particular caution when prescribing GLP-1 RAs to older [diabetic] patients or those with a history of stroke, as both groups were found to have an even higher risk of developing [the condition].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1599?guestAccessKey=3bb97cc4-36f2-4679-807b-4741de2fa139&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Brian VanderBeek, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said the findings suggested that large numbers of patients could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This suggests as many as one in 1,000 GLP-1 RA users could progress to new age-related macular degenaration over unexposed patients: if this risk was carried over millions of users, those affected could end up being a sizable group of patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;VanderBeek said work needed to be done to determine if this only affects patients with diabetes or if those taking these drugs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, said: “Patient safety is our top priority and we take any report about an adverse event related to the use of our medicines very seriously. We work closely with authorities and regulatory bodies from around the world to continuously monitor the safety profile of our products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These medicines have been extensively examined in Novo Nordisk’s robust clinical development programs, including randomised controlled trials, which to date have not shown any observable treatment difference compared to placebo for macular degeneration or age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, Novo Nordisk does not conclude a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use, semaglutide and age-related macular degeneration at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer of the Medicines &amp;amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a UK watchdog, said: “Macular degeneration is not currently listed as a potential side-effect of these medicines. However, we keep the safety of these medicines under close review, including emerging evidence from scientific publications, and will take appropriate action where necessary. On the basis of the current evidence, the benefits of GLP-1 RAs outweigh the potential risks when used for the licensed indications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRXEza3pxVmo5REtJWjZ1YWEzYzdUeXA3R1o2OEVpTS10WWR5UHA3YUQxN3hCMlJmOEI0dWFHWElCNHZpZVR1c0YtREctUUlVd3BpNXctcjVkM0V6TVlvX3Y5SngyM3RfOWlFSHQ4b1NfbzZ6NlJDNE1yNUxVNFVqVHgzdmJudDhFU2dyejdZSVhLa2lqcnpTTXVuWkQwYWVlZWhCS2hITG12UkNv</guid></item><item><title>用于新冠疫苗注射， mRNA可能有助于摆脱艾滋病毒的身体-《纽约时报》 | Used in Covid Shots, mRNA May Help Rid the Body of H.I.V. - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFAxMGxGSkdWSEVweFVONnNRVmNjRVhzX1B4UDNRbE5HZ0NhTU1FVEszN280U2JLTWNuWHQzNHlkTkNDb2c3RjlhQjdPR05HZ1I2NE9uRDl3WFgwNW5TZ0xqQ2pNdTBQTkxNWVRGNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The technology that powered Covid vaccines may also lead scientists to a cure for H.I.V. Using mRNA, Australian researchers said they were able to trick the virus to come out of hiding, a crucial step in ridding the body of it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The research, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Communications, is still preliminary, and so far, has been shown to be successful only in a lab. But it suggests that mRNA has potential far beyond its use in vaccines as a means to deliver therapies against stubborn adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is a set of instructions for a gene. In the case of Covid vaccines, the instructions were for a piece of the coronavirus. In the new study, they are for molecules key to targeting H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Sharon Lewin, director of the Cumming Global Center for Pandemic Therapeutics in Melbourne, who led the study, called mRNA a “miraculous” tool “to deliver things that you want into places that were not possible before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Vaccines deploying mRNA instruct the body to produce a fragment of the virus, which then sets off the body’s immune response. In the United States, the shots were initially hailed for turning back the pandemic, then viewed by some with suspicion and fear. Some officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have falsely said that they are highly dangerous and even deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women-rfk-jr.html" title=""&gt;sought to limit the vaccine’s availability&lt;/a&gt; to pregnant women, children and healthy younger adults.

E coli, salmonella and listeria can easily transfer from raw produce, meat and eggs to other points we touch, such as a refrigerator or faucet handle, where Wang’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJVrCnjL4a8&amp;amp;t=920s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown they may be able to linger for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To avoid cross-contamination when cooking, wash your hands frequently and well – for 20 seconds under warm water, then dry them on a clean towel reserved especially for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Do not rinse raw&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;meat, such as chicken, she says. Doing so may help spread harmful bacteria, including via tiny airborne water droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanitize surfaces: &lt;/strong&gt;Dr Jae-Hyuk Yu, a professor of bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recommends using a bleach solution (one tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water), an Environmental Protection Agency-registered kitchen disinfectant, or an alcohol-based spray for sanitizing hard surfaces, especially after preparing raw meat. And when handling cleaning chemicals, use gloves and ventilate well. He recommends cleaning fridge shelves monthly and ensuring your fridge is consistently under 40F to prevent bacteria from lurking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f89ece10-bcd1-4d62-ab5a-120dc7602cf3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are microplastics really in everything – even my brain?","elementId":"f89ece10-bcd1-4d62-ab5a-120dc7602cf3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook meat thoroughly: &lt;/strong&gt;Always cook meat to its proper internal temperature, per the United States Department of Agriculture’s &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;: 145F for whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb, veal and fish (with a three-minute rest for meat), 160F for ground meats, and 165F for all poultry. Yu uses plastic cutting boards, rather than wood, for meat. “Even clean boards can harbor microbes in grooves,” he says, so wash any kind of board well with hot water and antibacterial soap after use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="replace-or-clean-kitchen-sponges-and-dishcloths" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace or clean kitchen sponges and dishcloths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sponges are notorious bacterial reservoirs,” says Yu. “Cleaning a knife used on raw chicken with a sponge, then using that same sponge on other dishes, can absolutely spread dangerous pathogens.” If you must use a sponge, microwave it, wet, for one to two minutes once a day or run it through the dishwasher with a heat-dry cycle, he advises. Yu replaces kitchen sponges every one to two weeks, and personally prefers sanitizable dishcloths that can be changed daily and put through a hot laundry cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="thaw-meat-properly" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thaw meat properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While it is convenient to thaw frozen meat at room temperature, doing so “allows the outer layers to enter the ‘danger zone’ between 40F and 140F, where bacteria can multiply rapidly, long before the center is thawed,” says Yu. Instead, thaw meat in the refrigerator. If you want to cook the meat immediately, use the microwave or place it in a sealed bag and submerge it in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. These methods keep the temperature in a safe range and limit bacterial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoid-leaving-food-out-overnight" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid leaving food out overnight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Leaving food out at room temperature is “essentially incubating the bacteria that are in that food”, says an Idaho-based microbiologist and medical laboratory scientist certified by the American Society for Clinical Pathology who goes by the &lt;a href="https://morticiaslab.com/en-cad/pages/about" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pseudonym Morticia&lt;/a&gt; to avoid harassment as she shares food science information online.

If you’re actively eating over time – say, at an indoor party – food can stay out for up to four hours.

But it’s not always easy to tell if something has gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If food smells or tastes funny, that’s definitely a red flag,” says San Millan. But pathogens can accumulate without alerting our senses to trouble. “Certain bacteria, such as salmonella, can produce infections in humans even if they are at a very low concentration in the food – so low that you could never appreciate any change in a sniff or taste test,” says San Millan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most of the time, eating questionable food will probably only lead to some gastrointestinal discomfort, but “if you are unlucky and get infected by bacteria such as listeria or salmonella, or intoxicated with botulinum toxin, you may be in serious trouble,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-24" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mold can send microscopic threads throughout the cheese, contaminating more than what is visible on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For hard cheese such as cheddar, you can cut off at least 1in around and below the mold spot and keep using it,” Wang says, because fungi aren’t able to spread as quickly through denser textures. “The knife should be kept away from the moldy part to avoid cross-contamination,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-rely-on-spices-salt-or-acid-to-keep-food-safe" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t rely on spices, salt or acid to keep food safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People have used food preservation techniques like salting and pickling for millennia. But simply adding preservative ingredients to a dish doesn’t “shield” it from bacteria. Spicy, salty or acidic elements might slow spoilage under specific conditions, as with jerky or sauerkraut, but don’t guarantee protection from harmful pathogens. There have been listeria and salmonella outbreaks from pickles, for instance, notes Morticia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-assume-organic-food-is-safer" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t assume organic food is safer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There isn’t much of a difference in regard to bacterial contamination and pathogen transmission” when it comes to organic and conventional produce, Morticia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c2004a57-78b8-4c43-8098-87c1b7547f95" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":33,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Four tips for home care, from vacuuming your mattress to … cleaning your dishwasher?","elementId":"c2004a57-78b8-4c43-8098-87c1b7547f95","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/30/four-tips-for-home-care"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, when buying local, “the supply chain is a lot shorter and fewer people are coming into contact with that food,” she says.

Common food categories such as meat, eggs, shellfish, sprouts, greens and seeded vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers are all &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8135230/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;relatively high-risk&lt;/a&gt; for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Now is a good time for consumers to be more cautious,” says Yu, particularly with “high-risk foods like leafy greens, especially bagged lettuce”, which is prone to contamination with pathogens such as salmonella, listeria and E coli because of the way the greens are mixed from different farms and mass-processed before packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Morticia has changed her eating habits to prioritize safety in light of weaker industry regulations. “I went vegan in January, because most foodborne pathogens are zoonotic in origin, meaning they come from cows and pigs and chickens,” she says. She’s also opting for more stir-fries and fewer salads. “Cooking all of my foods significantly lowers risk,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPMURxTUcxTmlGcUVsQW55d0tWaVh1ZVFTcW1nSXZ1QlJ2S21UcEgzMVVYMlFteEpOWjdlbGhGQkM4VGpjVTlhc24ycW9MY3lRRVlmX0x5V25tcjMxclozMkVjODN6dHpZcDJLTnYyRmNhU2ZXNDBTb2QtT1pHR3BILXVLcHNBTEEtU1dYdDhRZUhpeGJoQVExVGxZbmxVZw</guid></item><item><title>2年的运动逆转了20年的心脏衰老：有史以来最长的运动随机试验-好消息网络 | 2 Years of Exercise Reversed 20 Years of Aging in the Heart: Longest-Ever Randomized Trial on Exercise - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOUUdfYndNeWZueUhicV9qZzdfTnNsX3VVOU0tSDBia295MzEta0x3LXJYVkU2alBSS1pEYmh3bVhKMXQ3TGczNHZuRkVQcUJCdU5yZ2xMMFpnOC1sT0NRakk1R0xOLWxnVl80WGRkTXhwd0FRWnJmckw0OGRZRFZoQXh3T2dmQ3JmUkVLejVLY1ZQZU1kY3A3d2xCTFdpcGU3T0o4OWpEUDZpMlNuSHNJTlQteFF2LUx1a1Bndll1eHFELUhOVFdiRmRrdFFGS1ZRTHZhU3dtQUY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise was in the news recently for being found in an epidemiological study to reduce the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what should be in the news is that a study published 7 years ago is going somewhat viral on the internet thanks to the profile of a popular health influencer, Dr. Rhonda Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6332782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study found&lt;/a&gt; middle-aged adults could reverse 20 years of age-related decline in their heart muscles through a 2 year exercise program, and that it effectively turned sedentary 55-year-olds into 30-year-olds when viewed through heart activity monitoring equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that heart disease is the leading cause of death for most people in the United States, and cardiac strength is inversely correlated with heart disease, it’s probably one of the most significant studies on exercise ever carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wit, the authors describe their trial, which took 61 people and put them on an exercise regimen for 2 years, as the longest, randomized controlled trial documenting the physiological effects of supervised, structured exercise on cardiovascular health ever performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were mentioned above: 2 years of work created a heart capable of working as hard as a 30-year-old’s, as if 20 years of aging had been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_218739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-218739" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-218739" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-326x217.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-530x353.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-218739" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;– credit Jon Matthews&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training program started light and gradually grew in intensity and duration, with months 6-10 representing peak output. The second year was characterized by a “maintenance period” of moderate intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="This Rarely-Trained Muscle Is Recognized Worldwide as a Marker of Human Health–And the Test for Living to 100" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/this-rarely-trained-muscle-is-recognized-worldwide-as-a-marker-of-human-health-and-the-test-for-living-to-100/" rel="bookmark"&gt;This Rarely-Trained Muscle Is Recognized Worldwide as a Marker of Human Health–And the Test for Living to 100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken down, it involved specifically two interval training sessions per week, along with one hour of “base pace,” which focused on a fun activity like low to moderate-intensity sports, cycling, or hiking. At peak training load, participants were training 5–6 hours per week, while during the maintenance period of the latter 14 months, that was dropped to about 4 hours, and included the removal of one of the two interval training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bears mentioning that even the lower intensity maintenance phase involved more training than typical government prescriptions of two-and-a-half hours. But as study author Benjamin Levine said on Dr. Patrick’s show, exercise should be thought of as personal hygiene—to be done with the same routine urgency as brushing one’s teeth or showering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point the authors &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030617" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; is that a measurement of fitness in middle age is the strongest predictor of future heart failure, and men and women of middle age who have had a lifetime of exercise behind them enjoy heart health closer to that of a 30 year old. But their study showed this could still be achieved in middle age even without a lifetime of exercise—in fact, just 2 years were required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXERCISE IS MEDICINE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="High Levels of Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Dementia Risk in Those with Genetic Predisposition" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/high-levels-of-physical-fitness-linked-to-lower-dementia-risk-for-genetic-predisposed/" rel="bookmark"&gt;High Levels of Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Dementia Risk in Those with Genetic Predisposition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points out, however, that there are limits to exercise’s abilities of age reversal and the heart’s capacity to forgive a lifetime of sedentary behavior. If moderate-intensity training programs are started age 65 or later, they do not appear to be able to overcome the damage—specifically the heart stiffening and shrinkage—from past sedentary periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests for physicians and clinicians that middle-aged hearts retain some degree of cardiac plasticity, and may represent a more optimal time—or quite simply the last time—to intervene with aggressive lifestyle modification aimed at improving cardiac health.&lt;/p&gt;

Bat cells lit up brightly, showing HKU5 can easily infect them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human cells, however, showed little response unless the virus carried specific mutations that improved its ability to latch onto ACE2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results raise concern that if HKU5 jumps to an intermediate animal, such as mink or civets, it could acquire mutatations before reaching humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FBI and CIA believe COVID-19 most likely &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8738963/Scientists-examine-possibility-Covid-19-leaked-Chines-lab.html"&gt;originated from a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was working with dangerous coronaviruses in the years leading up to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HKU5 was first discovered in 2005 in a species of bat called the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus), but only recently did scientists realize it can use ACE2, the same protein that allowed Covid-19 to enter human cells and infect millions worldwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another theory points to a wet market, where dozens of animals were kept in squalid conditions, possibly serving as an intermediate host before the virus jumped to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study published in the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60286-3.epdf?sharing_token=M_fyPpicsSi90ieoUVpsvdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MpJemnpboKpSy-Zw9PA9tV_-v8PA1nXzDlGTQ0NifJwD3Ei0bkgI1x3xtkoSHh4hV0i3yI2ZtbKyJbSSGmVFpaXlfHtzPEv8M87AIqSmuxYs1fAIGKvHljCW6afDXw5AA%3D"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, focused on a lesser-known group of coronaviruses known as merbecoviruses, which includes HKU5 and MERS-CoV, the virus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MERS spreads from camels to humans and has a fatality rate of about 34 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To visualize the virus's structure, scientists used cryo-electron microscopy, a high-resolution imaging method that allowed them to examine the spike protein in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that key parts of the spike remained in a 'closed' position, which makes infection more difficult, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These viruses are so closely related to MERS, so we have to be concerned if they ever infect humans,' Letko said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While there's no evidence they've crossed into people yet, the potential is there and that makes them worth watching.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, scientists in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;

Doctors had prescribed her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13835837/Common-prescription-drug-taken-tens-millions-linked-five-fold-increase-mental-breakdown.html"&gt;the popular drug Adderall&lt;/a&gt;, a stimulant taken by 16million Americans known to improve focus, attention, and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She started on a low dose, standard practice doctors follow to minimize side effects, which can include insomnia, increased heart rate, anxiety, mood swings, and jitteriness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she showed no improvement, doctors increased the dosage, first to 15mg, then to 20mg, 30mg, and, finally, 40mg, her highest dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert, 25, took a 40mg tablet every day for about two months with little incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when she went on a family vacation, she began experiencing troubling symptoms she didn’t immediately connect &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11920987/Americas-Adderall-boom-laid-bare-use-women-20s-shoots-fifth-year.html"&gt;to the prescription stimulant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was scratching my neck and I couldn’t feel anything. My neck had no feeling,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That numbness spread from her neck to her fingertips, and a week later, to her cheeks, eventually taking over her whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hannah Schweickert, a 25-year-old with ADHD, never expected Adderall—a common stimulant used to improve focus—to leave her body numb and her mind in panic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back at college one night, alone in her room and unable to feel her bed underneath her, she panicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I thought I was dying,’ she said, describing a destabilizing panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I immediately shot up, couldn’t breathe, my heart was beating out of my chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I didn’t know what a panic attack was, but that’s definitely what was happening.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert laid in a state of panic for an hour before a friend was able to get to her. She calmed herself, but it was far from the last panic attack that would strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@han.schw/video/7333417939091164459?lang=en&amp;amp;q=adhd%20medication%20side%20effects&amp;amp;t=1749044936593"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Then that started happening every day. The worst one probably lasted about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I couldn’t walk. My friends had to carry me to pee.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to say she had gone to the emergency room for her panic attacks, a common response people have to the sense of chest-tightening panic that mimics a heart attack, four times over the next few months, but doctors were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mom then suggested something that had not occurred to Schweikert previously: stop taking Adderall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Starting on a low dose to avoid typical side effects like anxiety and insomnia, she instead faced an alarming reaction that spread numbness from her toes to her face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point, I had no feeling in my entire body,’ Schweickert said. ‘It had been 22 days with no feeling. So all my nerves, something was wrong with them.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors would test her ability to feel touch on her arms, head, and legs, and according to them, everything seemed normal. She said they were not concerned and let her leave without any answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So she took it upon herself to figure out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert stopped taking her Adderall for a week, something doctors do not generally recommend because the withdrawal symptoms can be intense, causing depression, anxiety, headaches, muscle aches, and sleep disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some of her numbness subsided in that time. She continued her research, having seen a study that found rats given Adderall at high doses experienced considerable changes in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2017 study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394017300022"&gt;Neuroscience Letters&lt;/a&gt;, studied rats given 10mg of amphetamine (a key component of Adderall) and an antidepressant called desipramine, which extends the stimulant's effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rats’ dopamine levels plummeted and stayed low for seven days after a single dose. In addition to producing feelings of motivation and reward, dopamine can regulate pain and sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the researchers also found evidence of other neurotoxic effects in rats that could potentially explain Schweickert's reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adderall is a powerful stimulant that alters levels of neurotransmitters in the brain to improve focus, attention, and impulse control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicine starved the rats' brain cells of their energy source within an hour, making it impossible for nerve cells to send signals. This could lead to Schweiker's initial feelings of having a dead limb or tingling.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicine then overstimulated their brain cells by flooding the brain with glutamate, a chemical that can be toxic in high amounts. In humans, this could lead to hyperexcited nerves burning out, causing paralysis or numbness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug also caused a chemical 'explosion' in the brain that wiped out the brain’s natural defenses against antioxidants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, the destruction of the chemical in the brain that acts as a fire extinguisher against harmful substances called free radicals can cause nerve pain and numbness, particularly in the arms and legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the only thing that I found on the internet in a study that I was like, actually this could be what's happening to me,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she had never heard of someone having ‘allergic or neurotoxic effects’ from Adderall, but added, 'there must be someone in the world who's also experienced this.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The feeling in Schweickert’s body did not return completely, even after six months without taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘[I got] really nervous that my feeling would never return,’ she said. ‘Now I can say that it has.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Schweickert stopped Adderall for a week—against medical advice due to withdrawal risks like depression, fatigue, and headaches—some numbness faded. But it took months for the numbness to subside completely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are few studies that delve into the potential &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12532385/Adderall-overdoses-kids-ADHD.html" class=""&gt;brain-poisoning effects&lt;/a&gt; of stimulants, including Adderall and Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Ingalla, an Arizona-based nurse practitioner of psychiatry, told DailyMail.com if Schweikert had taken other drugs recreationally, their effects could have compounded Adderall’s tendency to constrict blood vessels, thereby reducing blood flow and causing numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingalla said: ‘If she tried this med recently after a psychedelic or other drugs, it wouldn't be an unusual reaction because of additive effects those drugs can have on vasoconstriction and the sensory systems of the brain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert did not say in the video whether she had been taking any other medication or drug at that time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures for the number of children taking Adderall or other ADHD medications are hard to pin down due to differences in prescription databases, changing trends over time (due to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11328263/Stark-graph-shows-Adderall-prescriptions-DOUBLED-pandemic.html"&gt;the Adderall shortage&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, for instance), state-by-state variations in reporting, and the rise of telehealth prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6118829/ADHD-surged-70-percent-20-years-study-finds.html"&gt;current estimates&lt;/a&gt; say that around 10 percent of American children, aged two to 17, have been diagnosed with ADHD, and 62 percent of them are being treated with medications, translating to about 4.5 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:15:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMktoYWxWTGwyNGJxc3BvcE9tc25LbTlXelVWWW5uSlNlYk9ZeFFsNy1KMFhvZFUtOW53anhpdE55U0hoc3BSZ0F6LXRKWU04TlJzNU9LZDZvY2pPTE9QLUVhUDdKYm8xakhwQ2tZYjJUMG1ZaWEwSU5FdDRPLUNDMGI0VHNHN1BRcWxUU2hGbkd4OExyQ3BaUmc5Rkc0bEnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUG0tRmU5dTQ4R3RCUjkyR3RjaW9rMl9GZy1nblNVakxSSFdDRUJLMm5wUk9aTVUyWkJnNVQ1alB3VkNhMkdLSlJ4YzhGV1F6VW4ybTBmX3l0MzhYVk52R2I0cm91Sm9ta3pHRlE5V2RaT2JScXo0cnNuaDdQdkZyU2dDTU5yQkJDVDhDNUVMdXJacHN2aHVpekFCVFVFMS1wT2pFeEw</guid></item><item><title>牛磺酸可能不是我们所希望的抗衰老奇迹- Gizmodo | Taurine Might Not Be the Anti-Aging Miracle We Hoped For - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPX1NPUWdpWmFldktKQ3FBQjRueWp1SWVsZHJTNlpaU0VnWjZaeC05Z0Y0UDk0QXJtV1JPc3l6WFVkR0RaUU04VmhaZFJaNXdNa29VWTNHUXBnVEdPM1VXRkxXUzhHbVVjOHN5ODZFT1VjSlhfQjdIb0ZTc2duMWpFMnlEZ3IyS2Q5Nm9VdWFucDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;You might want to hold off on stockpiling taurine supplements as part of your anti-aging cocktail. Research published today failed to find evidence that our levels of taurine shrink as we get older, contrary to some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health led the research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adl2116"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Science. They analyzed long-running data from past human, mice, and monkey studies, finding that taurine levels didn’t change much over time and widely varied between individual animals. The results suggest that taurine isn’t a good marker for age and throw into doubt the idea that it can prolong healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="timeline" data-v-234a609b=""&gt; &lt;p class="text" data-v-234a609b=""&gt;“Circulating taurine doesn’t decline with age in healthy individuals of these three mammalian species across the adult lifespan,” said lead study researcher Maria Emilia Fernandez, a postdoctoral fellow in the Translational Gerontology Branch of the NIH’s National Institute on Aging, in a press conference Tuesday announcing the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taurine is a semi-essential amino acid and important micronutrient. Our bodies naturally produce taurine, though it can also easily be found in animal products, supplements, and energy drinks (people once collected taurine from bulls, but it’s now &lt;a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/energydrink/is-taurine-made-from-bulls-testicles"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; synthetically). Taurine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3501277/"&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt; many roles in the body, such as helping us make bile acid and keeping our blood pressure stable. In recent years, some studies have indicated that taurine—or rather, the loss of taurine—might also be a key driver of our worsening health as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2023 study that looked at several different animal models, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taurine levels circulating in the blood declined as the animals aged. When the researchers added taurine supplements to the animals’ diets, it appeared to slightly extend the lifespan of mice and worms in addition to improving the health of older monkeys. The study also found an association between lower taurine levels in humans and an increased risk of age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this wasn’t the first research to suggest taurine’s anti-aging potential, it certainly sparked people’s attention, including the authors behind this latest research. Not every bit of research on the topic has supported this link, however, and many studies have only analyzed taurine in people and animals at a single point in time or for a relatively brief period. The researchers behind the new study wanted to take a closer look at how these levels fluctuated over time across different species and in both males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They turned to other existing studies or projects involving people, mice, and rhesus monkeys that had longitudinal data on taurine levels in the blood—meaning they could track these levels across the lifespan. Overall, they found that taurine levels didn’t decline in any of the animals or humans they studied; if anything, taurine levels usually increased over time in different groups (the sole exception being male mice). They also found that differences in taurine levels between individuals could sometimes vary significantly, and that these differences were usually larger than the changes seen over an animal’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, there doesn’t appear to be much of a connection at all between taurine and aging, at least in this research. “On the basis of these findings, we conclude that low circulating taurine concentrations are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are still findings from a single study, so more research will be needed to settle the question. The results also don’t mean that taurine isn’t important to our health. And it is still possible that low taurine levels can contribute to chronic health problems, including conditions that become more common as we age. Likewise, there may be some older people with low taurine who would benefit from increasing their intake.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Vijay Yadav, one of the authors behind the 2023 study, and his colleagues are currently running a randomized clinical trial testing whether taurine supplements can improve the health and fitness of middle-aged adults. He expects the trial to conclude by the end of 2025, with analysis coming soon after. For now, though, Yadav isn’t saying that people should be downing taurine like it’s candy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We cannot really recommend any supplementation. We need to have a better understanding if it does or it does not [improve health]; that can only be addressed by a placebo controlled trial,” said Yadav in the same press conference Tuesday. “And of course there are a lot more questions that need to be addressed before you can really understand the biology to more depth of a particular molecule.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly things people can already do to stay healthier into their golden years, such as exercising regularly, the track record for anti-aging drugs or supplements overall remains spotty for the time being. And it seems that a universal fountain of youth—if we can ever truly find it—probably won’t contain any taurine.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Cumberland County Animal Services confirmed a case of rabies in a fox Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A home inspector was completing an inspection of a crawl space under a home off Garden Court in Fayetteville when he was bitten by an adult fox. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal services confined, captured and euthanized the fox. The fox’s remains were sent to the N.C. State Public Health Lab, where it was tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The home inspector is receiving medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This is the second case of confirmed rabies found in &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/state/cumberland-county-rabies-case-april-2025/"&gt;Cumberland County&lt;/a&gt; in the last two months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It is the third reported in the last month in the Triangle, after a man strangled a coyote and later &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/coyote-attacks-roxboro-man-rabies-positive-person-co-health-officials-may-2025/"&gt;tested positive for rabies in Roxboro&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/raleigh-rabies-wild-fox-june-2025/"&gt;wild fox found in Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; also tested positive, though it is believed it had no contact with other humans or animals.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There is no confirmation that these cases are linked. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/cumberland-county-rabies-case-fox-bite-fayetteville-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cumberland County Animal Services urges all pet owners to check the rabies vaccination status of their pets. If pets are not vaccinated or are due for a booster shot, they should be taken to a local veterinarian for rabies vaccination immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The first sign of rabies in animals is usually a change in behavior. Signs of rabies in animals can include aggressive behavior, attacking for no reason, or becoming very quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wild animals can lose their fear of people and seem tame. Rabid animals may walk in a circle, drag a leg or fall over. Some cannot swallow, are unable to eat or drink, and often drool. Animals usually die within a week after first becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wildlife experts advise people to make loud noises and wave their arms to scare away any suspicious wildlife. Here are some other tips to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination. If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended. Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from animals you don't know. Teach children to do the same. "Love your own, leave others alone!" is a good rule to remember.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report stray animals to your local animal control office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It says that 90 percent of patients diagnosed with nAMD are considered legally blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the condition, new, abnormal and fragile blood vessels grow on the macula — an area in the center of the eye behind central, high-resolution, color vision — and may then leak blood and fluid onto it, causing damage and loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it isn't clear exactly what causes the condition, the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that it could be due to shifts in hormones in the eye sparking the growth of more blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1455?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525"&gt;JAMA Opthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists extracted data on 139,000 adults in Ontario, Canada, from the ICES database — which collects data on patients in the province from public sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the patients had type 2 diabetes, and they were 66 years old on average. Some 46 percent were female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 46,000 were prescribed a weight loss drug like Ozempic for at least six months — while the rest took different diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over three years, researchers recorded 93 cases of nAMD in the weight loss drug group (or 0.2 percent of patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in the group not using the drug, there were 88 cases (or 0.1 percent of patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Real Housewives of New Jersey star Dolores Catania admitted to using Ozempic to lose weight for the six weeks ahead of the RHNJ reunion. There is no evidence that she lost any vision due to the drug&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Todd Engel pictured above with his wife Shelley. He has lost vision in both his eyes after taking the weight loss and type 2 diabetes medication Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said: 'An explanation for the increasing risk with prolonged exposure is that the retina contains receptors for GLP-1, and [these] are known to increase the levels of CXCL12.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said CXCL12 is a substance that attracts white blood cells, with this possibly causing the growth of new blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the patients, 97 percent were reported to be on a semaglutide — which includes semaglutide — while the rest were on lixisenatide — brand name Adlyxin.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists started tracking the individuals between January 2020 and November 2023 for up to three years on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic's maker Novo Nordisk is already facing several lawsuits from people who say that the drug robbed them of their sight — including Todd Engel, a 62-year-old type 2 diabetic who lost vision in his right eye just four months after he started using the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, his doctors had no clue the jabs could be linked to it, and dismissed it as a coincidence — leading him to continue to use them. Six months later, he also lost vision in his left eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the damage is permanent and that Engle will never see again —  with the most he can perceive being faint pinpricks of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a rare condition that cuts off blood flow to the optic nerve and causes permanent vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Todd Engel is pictured above with the grandchildren and one of his children while on a family outing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now blind in both eyes, the 62-year-old has been forced to give up his job as a motor equipment operator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At home, his family has installed special push-button controls for the microwave and television — devices he can no longer see, but can still hear.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says he was never warned of the potential risk — and believes he would have reconsidered the drug had he known the danger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engel had lived with type 2 diabetes for more than 25 years, and had been taking medication to manage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His lawyers say he had no history of eye problems, and routinely passed the annual vision tests required for his job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engel’s Attorney Ashley Hornstein, from the law firm Motley Rice, told the Daily Mail: ‘The tragic thing about this case is that he had no idea this was even a possibility with the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He stayed on Ozempic for another five or six months after the vision loss happened the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If he hadn't, it's quite likely that he would still have vision in one eye today — that is all part of this horrific tragedy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:31:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNNlJvWmJLUE8wb0l6MVJEZjQ4bTVtOW9IbFBsMjg2aW5XUnhIbGtjb1hKLThqMktpUFdBZ1pJZ3hFTzNZTXJJZmNvT0NBeUFIU1pQN2k3aTBsQnRJSlYtSHA2TlFhVzNYSzZ6QTdqdVVzdzJEc2swWjV6NHdxV1FfbV9JQlE5d2FDQmplQzlKdXRjY0hzRlUza2FWUTNwQzRCb2tadGZQRHBUMjJY</guid></item><item><title>这种草药与更好的记忆力、降低焦虑和防止阿尔茨海默氏症有关-《独立报》 | The herb linked to better memory, lower anxiety and protection from Alzheimer’s - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOR0FsUk9fMDdFaVRUU1h3NTJPaWpmQ0MyZ2tvYXBkRzlkd1lRVjJGY004Z1NjWExCUlE5OGVxLUtacElhWTU4ZHlBUnBENHdFYUVkZHNMZ1VMUjB5c3BNSzJDVnMwTGZiTWduRTJBaGdSUW10aVJYcXBVM1V2dUt2aGZZR3hXc2M5VTFSZ1dMdnhGTjVxelRvS0V3QlQ1b01jS0doSVFTMVN4NDJ0Q2ZoQzB1dVFoMmdZR3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

But beyond its culinary charm, rosemary is also gaining recognition for its impressive health benefits, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="/topic/brain-health"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, inflammation and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests rosemary may even hold promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of &lt;a href="/topic/dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, rosemary has been linked to &lt;a href="/topic/memory"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; and mental clarity. In ancient Greece and Rome, students and scholars used rosemary in the hope of sharpening concentration and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern science is finding there may have been something in this: in one study, people who inhaled rosemary’s scent performed better on memory tasks compared to those in an unscented environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does rosemary work on the brain? There are several mechanisms at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 eVrEhv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/06/27/09/iStock-182890157.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/06/27/09/iStock-182890157.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/06/27/09/iStock-182890157.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) is the aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-69081"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) is the aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, rosemary stimulates blood circulation, including to the brain, helping deliver more oxygen and nutrients, which may improve mental clarity. It also has calming properties; some studies suggest its aroma can reduce &lt;a href="/topic/anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improve sleep. Lower stress can mean better focus and memory retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary contains compounds that interact with the brain’s neurotransmitters. One such compound, 1,8-cineole, helps prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for learning and memory. By preserving acetylcholine, rosemary may help support cognitive performance, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bonus? Rosemary is packed with antioxidants, which help protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress – a major factor in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is rich in phytochemicals, plant compounds with health-enhancing effects. One of the most powerful is carnosic acid, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that helps shield brain cells from harm, particularly from the kinds of damage linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 eTsGOy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Research suggests rosemary may even hold promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-69082"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Research suggests rosemary may even hold promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, researchers developed a stable version of carnosic acid called diAcCA. In promising pre-clinical studies, this compound improved memory, boosted the number of synapses (the connections between brain cells), and reduced harmful Alzheimer’s related proteins like amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s especially exciting is that diAcCA only activates in inflamed brain regions, which could minimise side effects. So far, studies in mice show no signs of toxicity and significant cognitive improvements, raising hopes that human trials could be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also believe diAcCA could help treat other inflammatory conditions, such as &lt;a href="/topic/type-2-diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/topic/cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary’s benefits could extend well beyond the brain. It’s been used traditionally to ease digestion, relieve bloating and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds like rosmarinic acid and ursolic acid are known for their anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body. Rosemary may even benefit the skin – a review suggests it can help soothe acne and eczema, while carnosic acid may offer anti-ageing benefits by protecting skin from sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary oil also has antimicrobial properties, showing promise in food preservation and potential pharmaceutical applications by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, rosemary is safe when used in food, teas or aromatherapy. But concentrated doses or extracts can pose risks. Consuming large amounts may cause vomiting or, in rare cases, seizures – particularly in people with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a theoretical risk of rosemary stimulating uterine contractions, so pregnant people should avoid high doses. Because rosemary can interact with some medications – such as blood thinners – it’s best to check with a healthcare provider before taking large amounts in supplement form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is more than just a kitchen staple.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) causes fibrosis (scarring) and can lead to cirrhosis and is linked to greater risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the vast majority of people do not know they have the condition. An international group of researchers examined prevalence and diagnosis of aggressive fatty liver disease in the US, UK, Germany and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers found that just under 3% of people in the UK, France and Germany, and 4% of those in the US have MASH, but diagnosis rates were below 18%. That means about 20 million people in the US, UK, Germany and France are living with MASH but only 2.5 million people have a diagnosis, leaving more than three-quarters – about 16.7 million people – unaware they have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report, published in the Lancet Regional Health Europe&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the meeting of the global thinktank on &lt;a href="https://sldthinktank.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;steatotic liver disease&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday, calls for a doubling in diagnosis rates from 2022 levels. Traditionally, MASH was diagnosed through biopsy, but now non-invasive methods such as blood tests, ultrasound and MRI scans can be used. As a result, everyone with type 2 diabetes; obesity combined with one or more other risk factors; and those with persistently high liver enzymes should be screened for MASH, the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jeffrey Lazarus, the lead author of the paper and a professor of global health in New York and Barcelona, said: “Undiagnosed MASH costs economies billions of pounds in lost productivity and poor health. Unless diagnosis rates are doubled, alongside similar increases in treatment and care, direct health costs alone are predicted to triple over the next 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Emmanouil Tsochatzis, a professor of hepatology at University College London and a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Free hospital, said: “More than 15 million people across the US and Europe have the deadliest form of fatty liver disease – and don’t know it. Without faster diagnosis and access to treatment, the human and economic toll will skyrocket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research has also prompted renewed calls for weight loss jabs to be used to treat MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="09bdb291-d451-4594-9049-402eb0ec18e2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Contraception warning over weight-loss drugs after dozens of pregnancies","elementId":"09bdb291-d451-4594-9049-402eb0ec18e2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/05/contraception-warning-over-weight-loss-drugs-after-dozens-of-pregnancies"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Paul Brennan, a co-author of the Lancet paper and a hepatologist at NHS Tayside, said: “GLP-1s (including Wegovy and Mounjaro) offer the potential to resynchronise our metabolism, by introducing feelings of satiety – fullness – and delaying the time the stomach takes to empty. These effects often result in reduced calorie intake, and improvements in how the liver handles nutrients as a result of weight loss, thus reducing scar tissue formation in the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Michael Betel, the president of the Fatty Liver Alliance, said: “Too many people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity are never tested for MASH until it’s too late. We need a huge increase in liver health assessments in patients living with these diseases, alongside lifestyle changes and for some, when appropriate, weight loss drugs to reduce blood sugar and appetite.

Could those suggestions lead to real, testable breakthroughs in the lab? The results suggest the answer might be yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-finds-new-drug-ideas-for-cancer"&gt;AI finds new drug ideas for cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research focused on GPT-4, a large language model (LLM) that is trained on vast amounts of internet text. The team designed prompts that asked GPT-4 to generate pairs of drugs that could work against MCF7 breast cancer cells but not harm healthy cells (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4493126/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MCF10A&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also restricted the model from using known cancer drugs and instructed it to prioritize options that were affordable and already approved for use in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not automation replacing scientists, but a new kind of collaboration,” said Dr. Hector Zenil from King’s College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guided by expert prompts and experimental feedback, the AI functioned like a tireless research partner, rapidly navigating an immense hypothesis space and proposing ideas that would take humans alone far longer to reach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first round, GPT-4 proposed 12 unique drug combinations. Interestingly, all combinations included drugs not traditionally associated with cancer therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included medications for conditions like high cholesterol, parasitic infections, and alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, these combinations were not arbitrary. GPT-4 provided rationales for each pairing, often tying together biological pathways in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-combos-work-well"&gt;Some combos work well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to test the drug pairs in the lab. Scientists measured two things: how well each combination attacked MCF7 cells and how much damage was caused to MCF10A cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also evaluated whether the drug pairs worked better together than separately, a property known as synergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three combinations stood out for having better results than standard cancer therapies. One involved simvastatin and disulfiram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another paired dipyridamole with mebendazole. A third involved itraconazole and atenolol. These drug pairs were not only effective against MCF7 cells, but they worked without overly harming healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supervised LLMs offer a scalable, imaginative layer of scientific exploration, and can help us as human scientists explore new paths that we hadn’t thought of before,” said Professor Ross King from Cambridge’s Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-and-humans-improve-ideas-together"&gt;AI and humans improve ideas together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the first set of results, the researchers asked GPT-4 to analyze what had worked and suggest new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shared summaries of the lab findings and prompted the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-helps-humans-have-20-minute-conversation-with-humpback-whale-named-twain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; to propose four more drug combinations, including some involving known cancer drugs like fulvestrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the AI returned combinations such as disulfiram with quinacrine and mebendazole with quinacrine. Three of the four new suggestions again showed promising synergy scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective combinations was disulfiram with simvastatin, which achieved the highest synergy score of the entire study at over 10 on the HSA scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop, AI suggesting ideas, humans testing them, then feeding results back to the AI, represents a novel way of conducting science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process no longer moves in one direction. Instead, it cycles, with both machine and human adjusting and improving as they learn from each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-found-surprising-cancer-combos"&gt;AI found surprising cancer combos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the twelve original combinations, six showed positive synergy scores for MCF7 cancer cells. These included unusual pairings like furosemide and mebendazole or disulfiram and hydroxychloroquine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, eight of these twelve combinations had greater effects on MCF7 cells than on MCF10A cells, indicating good specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most toxic drugs to MCF7 cells included disulfiram, quinacrine, niclosamide, and dipyridamole. Disulfiram had the lowest IC50 value, meaning it required only a small dose to reduce cell viability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4’s ability to find such effective non-cancer drugs and pair them meaningfully surprised even the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study demonstrates how AI can be woven directly into the iterative loop of scientific discovery, enabling adaptive, data-informed hypothesis generation and validation in real time,” said Zenil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hallucinations-as-creative-leaps"&gt;Hallucinations as creative leaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4 sometimes makes mistakes. These are called hallucinations, statements not supported by its training data. In most cases, hallucinations are flaws. But in hypothesis generation, they can be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, one such hallucination involved the claim that itraconazole affects cell membrane integrity in human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is true for fungi, human cells do not use the same biological pathway. Yet, this flawed idea still led to successful experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The capacity of supervised LLMs to propose hypotheses across disciplines, incorporate prior results, and collaborate across iterations marks a new frontier in scientific research,” said King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-may-help-tailor-cancer-treatments"&gt;AI may help tailor cancer treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team believes that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-can-alert-doctors-when-patients-might-get-sicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; and lab automation could eventually reduce the cost of personalized medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment might one day involve a custom research project for each patient. Instead of general prescriptions, therapies could be tested and tailored in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of running a lab remains high, but AI like GPT-4 drastically cuts down the time and effort required to generate useful hypotheses. With further advances in robotics, the physical testing process might also become cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our empirical results demonstrate that the GPT-4 succeeded in its primary task of forming novel and useful hypotheses,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-future-science"&gt;What this means for future science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows that AI can do more than summarize or analyze. It can take part in generating new scientific knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4 didn’t just crunch numbers. It offered unexpected ideas, learned from outcomes, and improved its suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combinations it proposed still need clinical trials. They are far from becoming approved treatments. But their success in lab settings highlights the potential of repurposing safe, existing drugs for new uses, something that could save years of development time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of The Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;arXiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:07:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQWWY2My03VGxiaVlaNVFReDhzNG9aU0puRWhTanRjdnowelZVSV9tMkJJOHQ5YWhDd3JSWV9QbkIxZFAwWC0tSXQxc0tva3ZLaUdTTVV6cl9leVJJRWh5cEsxczRJSkxDYXhOeVRjanBxdFk4Q3RVeDhnaWs3Y1BvM01WTFVKQWZMOEdkU0l4elk0UHJ1NWxLYjZ6MmpZU2M4YjhIM3NCMmpGTU9DQ0c3WlFzWlVpUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， GLP-1药物可能与严重眼疾风险升高有关- statnews.com | GLP-1 drugs may be linked to elevated risk of serious eye disease, study finds - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPTkx6akk4bWtlNnNjTHpGaFQ4Rk5ERDItekE4dWk1bW1JY1h5TTdhYUxQX0RBSE01cVRld2RzaTNYTjdyLXl6OE1BOHpqWXJEbjZ6dS11cVo1Ymg3RUxXdUNCYnFBMFJvZTZ4cVdtQlZjRXRJd3EyTndmRXFJV09kaThWUUFSVW5XbGtMQmFHRnd0cUZJSG1kU2ZRX0RlZmdQQzRERUxSekVQZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes who were taking GLP-1 drugs had a low but elevated risk of an age-related eye disease that can sometimes lead to blindness, a new observational study concludes, adding to a short list of concerns about eye health in people taking the powerful medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1455?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, found that after one year, more than twice as many people on GLP-1 drugs developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration compared to similar people who were not taking the drugs. The risk was 0.2% in people taking GLP-1s and 0.1% in those who didn’t. Participants, drawn from health records of nearly 140,000 patients in Canada, were matched for socioeconomic status and a long list of conditions in addition to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AMD is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in older people; the study participants were 66 years old, on average. Neovascular AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease, known for its abnormal growth of blood vessels and damage to the central part of the retina called the macula. It can be treated with frequent injections to potentially restore or stabilize vision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People at risk for nAMD share the same conditions — chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease — that make patients with diabetes candidates for GLP-1s. Aware of other eye problems in people taking GLP-1s, researchers looked for a relationship between the drugs and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seeing such a clear signal in our study was striking,” co-author Reut Shor of the University of Toronto told STAT. “The absolute risk remains low, but the advanced form of AMD is a condition with serious implications for vision and quality of life. So a doubling of risk is clinically meaningful, particularly for vulnerable populations like older adults who may already be at elevated baseline risk.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Famous for their success in helping people lose weight, GLP-1 drugs were originally intended to control their blood sugar. Since then, they’ve shown promise in countering cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Parkinson disease, and substance use disorders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As their use has taken off, though, more eye problems have been reported, including abnormal blood vessel growth. It’s not unusual for rare side effects to show up when more people take a drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cases of this &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1901118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;retinopathy&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in two studies of people with diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and a history of GLP-1 usage for 20 or 24 months. The risk of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/03/ozempic-wegovy-naion-vision-loss-study/"&gt;nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,&lt;/a&gt; when the optic nerve’s blood flow is blocked, was also found to be higher in people on GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there’s a common cause, researchers speculate that it might be plunging blood glucose levels spurred by GLP-1s that trigger abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. The new study can’t prove that, or even connect cause and effect, its authors emphasize, but their results add to concern about safety and eye health of people being treated for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diabetes itself has long been known to cause retinal degeneration because of too much blood sugar, something that drugs like the standby metformin have been able to control. The issue with GLP-1s may go beyond blood sugar, though. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are GLP-1 receptors in the retina, the authors write, and GLP-1 drugs increase the levels of molecules that lead to harmful blood vessel formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study raises questions about whether direct or indirect effects are driving the increased risk of nAMD. The next steps for the research would ideally include studies in animal models and human tissue to determine the mechanism, as well as large, prospective clinical studies in diverse populations to further clarify causality, Shor said. It would also be important to study people without diabetes who are using GLP-1s for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Shor said, these results should not cause alarm or abrupt changes in prescribing, but they do warrant greater awareness and appropriate monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means patients should promptly report any new visual symptoms, such as blurred or distorted vision, straight lines appearing wavy, or new blind spots. These symptoms could indicate early signs of AMD, Shor said, and should trigger an immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether discontinuing the drug at that point would lessen risk for AMD remains an open question that future research might answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian VanderBeek of the Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania said further research is also needed to pin down the association between the drug and higher rates of eye disease. In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;companion editorial&lt;/a&gt;, he points out that follow-up studies of diabetic retinal disease and neuropathy in people taking GLP-1s showed the risks were lower than initially thought. But the new paper does cause concern. If its findings are borne out, he writes, as many as 1 in 1,000 GLP-1 users might develop nAMD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 RAs have had a tremendous role in the care of patients with diabetes and now those needing additional help with weight management,” VenderBeek writes. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yersinia pestis—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the bacterium that causes the bubonic plague—experienced a genetic tweak that allowed rodents to live longer after they were infected, according to a new study. This alteration may have prolonged two significant plague pandemics, including the deadliest event in human history: the Black Death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at the Institut Pasteur in France and McMaster University in Canada studied hundreds of ancient &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;DNA samples to investigate a gene called “pla.” Their study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;published May 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt3880"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, identified a decrease in repetitions of the pla gene in the &lt;i&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/i&gt; genome during the later stages of both the first and second major plague pandemics. The researchers believe these pla depletions ultimately allowed these pandemics to last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first plague pandemic, known as the Plague of Justinian, struck the Mediterranean basin during the sixth century and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903797116"&gt;&lt;span&gt;caused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; tens of millions of deaths over the course of two centuries. The second emerged when the Black Death broke out in 1347, killing an estimated 30% to 50% of Europe’s population in just six years. But this was just the beginning. Like the first pandemic, this plague continued to reemerge for centuries, lasting more than 500 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This newly discovered evolution of the pla gene offers more insight into how these plagues persisted for so long. &lt;span&gt;The pla gene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; appears many times in the &lt;i&gt;Y. pestis’&lt;/i&gt; genome and plays a crucial role in its virulence by allowing it to infect the lymph nodes before traveling to the rest of the body, according to an Institut Pasteur &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/plague-bacillus-became-less-virulent-prolonging-duration-two-major-pandemics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This causes rapid septicemia—or blood poisoning—and quickly kills the victim. Therefore, a lack of this gene in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/i&gt;strains from the first and second major pandemics likely made the bacterium less virulent, the researchers suggest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To test that hypothesis, they infected mice with three preserved strains of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;from the third major pandemic that also had fewer repetitions of pla. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These three samples enabled us to analyze the biological impact of these pla gene deletions,” said co-author Javier Pizarro-Cerdá, director of the Yersinia Research Unit at the Institut Pasteur, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through their mouse model, Pizarro-Cerdá and his colleagues found that the pla depletion resulted in a 20% decrease in victim mortality. What’s more, it allowed infected rodents to live significantly longer. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that rats infected with pla-depleted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;strains may have been more effective disease vectors, as they had more time to spread the plague far and wide before they died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Rodents—particularly rats—played a critical role in spreading the bubonic plague to humans. People most commonly contract this disease via infected flea bites, and fleas typically contract it when they feed on infected rodents. Thus, an increase in the lifespans of sickened rodents would have provided greater opportunity for fleas to bite them, become infected, and then bite humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ours is one of the first research studies to directly examine changes in an ancient pathogen, one we still see today, in an attempt to understand what drives the virulence, persistence, and eventual extinction of pandemics,” said co-lead author Hendrik Poinar, director of the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre and holder of the Michael G. DeGroote Chair in Genetic Anthropology, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, the bubonic plague is considered a rare disease, though a small number of cases still emerge in western North America, Africa, Asia, and South America, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21590-bubonic-plague"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While this research provides valuable insight into the evolutionary history of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the world-altering pandemics it caused, it can also serve as a model for better understanding how deadly diseases emerge and spread, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            The United States is facing an alarming increase in overdose deaths among young people due to synthetic opioids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2znz4001o3b6mj0axw5gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, which include fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, increased &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db491.htm#:~:text=The%20age%2Dadjusted%20rate%20of%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20involving%20synthetic,rates%20of%20change%20over%20time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 20-fold&lt;/a&gt; between 2013 and 2022, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000p3b6m6ls8f2mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overdoses and drug poisonings are now the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761" target="_blank"&gt;third leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in people under age 20, behind firearms and motor vehicle crashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000q3b6mcb6hhoev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overdose death counts among US youth ages 15 to 24 rose from 4,652 to 6,723 between 2018 and 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/155/6/e2024069488/201955/Changes-in-Synthetic-Opioid-Involved-Youth" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Pediatrics. (A slight decrease occurred between 2021 and 2022.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000r3b6m29btblh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The largest increase was seen in deaths involving only synthetic opioids: Since 2020, fatal overdoses involving only these substances were higher than overdoses in which multiple substances were implicated. Overdose rates were nearly 2.5 times higher among male youths compared with female youths and more than two times higher among those ages 20 to 24 compared with those ages 15 to 19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000s3b6mds1apumy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a parent, I wanted to know more about synthetic opioids and their uses. Why are they so dangerous, and how are overdoses treated? How can people tell if the drugs they are taking contain synthetic opioids? Crucially, what can parents and other family members do to help reduce the risk of overdose?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000t3b6mx42dmsnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Previously, she served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where she oversaw the city’s opioid prevention strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are synthetic opioids? What are they used for?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200113b6mmdtxl772@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Prescription opioids are medications used to treat severe pain. They must be used with caution, however, because if they are used in higher than prescribed doses or otherwise incorrectly, they can result in drowsiness, slowed and shallow breathing, and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200123b6mnb5hbjvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Opioids can be classified by where they originate. So-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/glossary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;natural opioids&lt;/a&gt; are derived from the poppy plant and include drugs such as morphine and codeine. Semisynthetic opioids include oxycodone and hydrocodone. Synthetic opioids are made in the laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200133b6m0wo5ojkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The synthetic opioid most implicated in fatal overdoses is &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2" target="_blank"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. There are other synthetic opioids too, such as tramadol and methadone. Methadone is also used as a treatment for people with opioid use disorder. Notably, the CDC’s statistics and the new study in Pediatrics do not include methadone in their calculation of fatal overdoses due to synthetic opioids. The &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2" target="_blank"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of synthetic overdose deaths in the US involve fentanyl or fentanyl derivatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there legitimate medical uses of fentanyl?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200153b6mvdd82i4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. Fentanyl is often used in emergency settings to treat acute pain. For instance, someone who was in a high-speed car accident and just broke their hip needs immediate pain relief. It is also given to patients who have chronic pain that is not relieved by other methods. Some cancer patients with intractable pain use a fentanyl patch or fentanyl lozenge, for example.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200163b6maotuvkhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current trend of youth overdoses is probably not mostly due to fentanyl being diverted from legitimate medical purposes. In recent years, there has been a significant problem with fentanyl being made in illegal labs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200173b6mi1trpe7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Synthetic fentanyl is sold illegally as a powder dropped onto blotter paper, put in eyedroppers and nasal sprays or, perhaps most terrifyingly, as pills that resemble other prescription pills, according to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/fentanyl" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200183b6mqj36s29c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, fentanyl is often mixed in with other drugs. People who think they are taking amphetamines, oxycodone, cocaine, heroin, MDMA (also known as ecstasy) or other “party drugs” may be unknowingly taking fentanyl. Depending on the amount of fentanyl they are ingesting, they could overdose and die.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; To begin, fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/24/health/fentanyl-visual-guide/index.html"&gt;50 to 100 times&lt;/a&gt; more potent than morphine. A small amount can lead to oversedation and death. People may not realize how dangerous fentanyl is or even that what they are taking has fentanyl in it. There have been numerous cases of high school and college-age students who have died after being &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/us/campbell-fentanyl-dangers/index.html"&gt;given fentanyl-laced pills.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The treatment for opioid overdose is the medication &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/health/naloxone-opioids-fentanyl-overdose-prescription-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt;, also sometimes referred to by its brand name Narcan. It is available as a nasal spray and as an intramuscular injection. The nasal spray is available over the counter for under $50. Some health insurance plans will cover naloxone, and some state and local health departments may give out this medication free of charge. If given immediately after someone loses consciousness, it could reverse the overdose and save someone’s life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001d3b6m8crwcgen@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Individuals who come to after getting naloxone should still receive immediate medical care. They may need additional doses of naloxone, and they could need treatment for other potentially dangerous substances they have taken.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001e3b6mz68vcpk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an important question — the answer is that people can’t easily tell if the drug they are taking contains fentanyl. Counterfeit medications can look exactly like the prescription form. If fentanyl is mixed in with cocaine or other illicit drugs, it’s not possible to tell based on simply looking at the substance, as fentanyl is odorless and colorless.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001g3b6mipurul72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stop-overdose/safety/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/stopoverdose/fentanyl/fentanyl-test-strips.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fentanyl test strips&lt;/a&gt; can check for the presence of fentanyl in the drug supply. While the use of these strips can reduce overdose risk, know that just because one pill in the supply doesn’t contain fentanyl doesn’t mean that others all don’t. Moreover, these strips don’t test for other contaminants that can also be deadly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001h3b6m0i78vnsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I want to share another key number: Of the fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills analyzed in 2022 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration Laboratory, &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/dea-laboratory-testing-reveals-6-out-10-fentanyl-laced-fake-prescription-pills-now-contain" target="_blank"&gt;6 out of 10&lt;/a&gt; contained a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. This is a sobering statistic and should be reason enough for people never to use illicit prescription pills or other illegal substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001i3b6mqimmu2sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Parents should speak with their children about the danger of counterfeit and illicit drugs. It doesn’t matter if parents used drugs when they were younger. Drugs today are so much more powerful and dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001k3b6mbcd54dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People should never take medications that don’t belong to them. They don’t know where the medications came from, if the medications are really what they claim to be, and whether they have contaminants such as fentanyl in which even a small amount could be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001l3b6m8ejupvkk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I think it’s also good practice to have naloxone accessible. As I mentioned, this medication is now available &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/health/naloxone-opioids-fentanyl-overdose-prescription-health-wellness"&gt;over the counter&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone can learn to use it and have it in their medicine cabinet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Using postmortem brain tissue and advanced neuroimaging, researchers found that this network is composed of distinct anatomical types of brain tissue, each with different roles in processing information. The findings help explain why the default mode network is involved in such a wide variety of mental states—from introspection to decision-making—and suggest that its structure enables a unique balance of communication across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default mode network, or DMN, is one of the most widely studied yet poorly understood brain systems in neuroscience. It was originally discovered through brain scans showing that certain regions become less active when a person focuses on an external task, like solving a math problem. But over time, researchers noticed these same regions were also active during a wide range of cognitive activities, such as daydreaming, remembering the past, imagining the future, and even making complex decisions. This unexpected versatility raised fundamental questions about what the DMN does and how it manages to participate in such seemingly contradictory mental functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key to solving this puzzle, the researchers hypothesized, lies in the network’s anatomy. Much of the past research on the DMN has used functional MRI to track patterns of activity, but less attention has been paid to the underlying microstructure that might shape those functions. The authors of the new study believed that a deeper understanding of the DMN’s cellular and anatomical features could clarify how it supports such a diverse array of mental processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The default mode network has a fascinating history in neuroscience. It was first identified as a group of brain regions that become less active when people engage in a specific task,” explained study author Casey Paquola, the head of &lt;a href="https://multiscale-neurodevelopment.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Multiscale Neurodevelopment Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7) at the Helmholtz Associations’ Research Center Jülich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But over time, researchers noticed that these same regions were actually activated during a wide variety of tasks — from recognizing faces to making decisions. This led to a lot of diverse theories about what the DMN is and what its role is in cognition. So, despite being discussed in tens of thousands of studies since 2001, it remained enigmatic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably, the vast majority of those studies used fMRI to study the DMN. As I work at the intersection of neuroanatomy and neuroimaging, I thought it would be a novel angle to investigate this functional entity through the lens of neuroanatomy. We wanted to test whether the hypotheses based on functional MRI were supported or rejected based on the architecture of the DMN.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the research team combined two powerful tools: postmortem brain histology and in vivo neuroimaging. The histological data came from a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of a human brain donated after death, allowing for precise mapping of cell densities and tissue types across the cortex. The team analyzed nearly 7,400 thinly sliced brain sections, stained to reveal the shapes and layers of cells, and reconstructed them into a 3D model known as “BigBrain.” These anatomical maps were then compared with functional brain networks defined by resting-state MRI scans in living participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on how different parts of the DMN varied in their cytoarchitecture—the arrangement and characteristics of cells across different layers of the cortex. They identified several types of cortical microstructure within the DMN, ranging from areas specialized for processing sensory information to regions associated with memory and internal thought. This showed that the DMN is not uniform but rather includes a mix of cell types, each potentially suited for different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data-driven modeling, the team found a spectrum—or axis—of cytoarchitectural variation across the DMN. Some regions had highly layered structures with dense mid-level cell populations, while others had flatter, less differentiated profiles. These differences aligned with known anatomical types, such as eulaminate regions that process external information and agranular areas often linked to self-generated thought and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined how these anatomical differences relate to the DMN’s connectivity. By analyzing diffusion MRI data from healthy adults, they assessed how efficiently information could travel along structural pathways linking different brain regions. They found that parts of the DMN with highly layered cytoarchitecture were more strongly connected to other brain regions, particularly those involved in sensory processing. These regions appeared to serve as “receivers,” efficiently gathering input from across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, areas with flatter cytoarchitecture were relatively isolated from sensory input, suggesting that they form an “insulated core” within the DMN. These more internally focused regions, like the anterior cingulate cortex, may support self-referential processing or maintain mental representations that are less dependent on immediate sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand the flow of information within the DMN, the researchers used a modeling technique called regression dynamic causal modeling. This method estimates how activity in one brain region influences another, providing a measure of functional input and output. The results confirmed that “receiver” regions in the DMN received strong input from a variety of other brain systems, while the more insulated areas were relatively unaffected by outside signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most strikingly, the researchers found that the DMN differs from other brain networks in how it sends information back out. While many networks tend to favor certain types of connections, the DMN distributed its output evenly across all levels of the brain’s processing hierarchy—from low-level sensory areas to high-level association regions. This suggests that the DMN plays a unique integrative role, capable of influencing thought and behavior at multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify that these patterns weren’t just artifacts of group-level analyses, the team conducted a replication study using ultra-high field 7-Tesla MRI in individual participants. This allowed them to map microstructural variation and connectivity within each person’s brain. The results were consistent with the earlier findings, supporting the idea that the DMN’s unique structure and connectivity patterns are present at the level of individual brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the DMN is largely expanded in humans relative to other mammals, more so than any other functional network, an interesting take-away from this study is that this unique network of brain regions is capable of enriching our interpretation of the world, by coloring our world view with other types of information, from autobiographical memory or social perspectives,” Paquola told PsyPost. “In other words, this network operates in a very different way to standard sensory processing, and that may help humans to have a richer understanding of the world around us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are limitations. The detailed anatomical mapping was based on a single postmortem brain, and while replication was attempted with high-resolution imaging in living subjects, further validation across more diverse samples is needed. The study also focused on healthy adults, leaving open questions about how the DMN might develop during childhood or change in mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will aim to understand how the DMN’s anatomy evolves over time and how it interacts with cognitive development and psychiatric symptoms. For example, if certain subregions mature more slowly or become disrupted in disorders such as depression or schizophrenia, this could help explain why these conditions involve changes in self-perception or thought patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very interested in how the brain develops, that is how it changes from infancy to adulthood,” Paquola said. “Moving forward, we’d like to understand more about how the maturation of the DMN coincides with cognitive maturation and changes in mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01868-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The architecture of the human default mode network explored through cytoarchitecture, wiring and signal flow&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Casey Paquola, Margaret Garber, Stefan Frässle, Jessica Royer, Yigu Zhou, Shahin Tavakol, Raul Rodriguez-Cruces, Donna Gift Cabalo, Sofie Valk, Simon B.

Scientists discovered unexpected RT activity in neurons of healthy and Alzheimer’s brains, tracing it to truncated LINE1 elements—ancient genetic sequences capable of copying themselves via RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These monocistronic LINE1 fragments were especially active in gray matter, where neurons reside and accumulate mutations over time. The findings suggest that existing RT inhibitors could be repurposed in clinical trials to help slow or prevent Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Brain RT Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Reverse transcriptase activity was found in neurons, especially in aging and Alzheimer’s-affected brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINE1 Variants Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Thousands of previously unannotated, truncated LINE1 transcripts were found to encode RT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA-approved HIV RT inhibitors may be repurposed for Alzheimer’s treatment through clinical trials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Sanford Burnham Prebys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia and affects more than a tenth of Americans aged 65 and older. The disease has proven difficult to develop new treatments for, and available treatment options are limited. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases in the U.S. projected to more than double by 2050, more therapies are needed to improve patients’ quality of life and reduce the burden on the health care system and family caregivers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110679"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, DNA, and pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/HIV-pharm-alzheimers-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Rare familial mutations in the APP gene cause a form of Alzheimer’s disease that can be inherited in families, whereas sporadic disease lacks this inheritance but can be affected by non-inherited “somatic” mutations produced by RT. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and elsewhere have recently reported real-world links in medical records associating common HIV drugs with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies showed patients were at less risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease if they were taking drugs to block a famous enzyme called reverse transcriptase (RT), which copies RNA into DNA, opposite to the classical process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RT is best known from being an essential enzyme allowing HIV and other retroviruses to replicate in host cells, and FDA-approved RT inhibitor drugs prevent HIV reproduction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the links between Alzheimer’s disease risk and people taking prescribed RT inhibitor drugs, Jerold Chun, MD, PhD, and colleagues at Sanford Burnham Prebys looked for evidence of actual RT activity in the aging human brain and in brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease, identifying RT enzymatic activity, and novel RNAs that encode brain RTs especially in neurons of the aging human brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published online May 14, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chun lab’s prior landmark publication in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 2018 described how RT-mediated somatic gene recombination of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene can occur in neurons of the human brain including those from the most common non-familial or sporadic form of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare familial mutations in the APP gene cause a form of Alzheimer’s disease that can be inherited in families, whereas sporadic disease lacks this inheritance but can be affected by non-inherited “somatic” mutations produced by RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We asked a basic question: is there actually any RT activity in the aging human brain?” said Chun, a professor in the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Center for Neurologic Diseases at the institute and the senior and corresponding author of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And, if there is, where does it come from and which brain cells are affected?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists examined post-mortem brain tissue from donors who had died from Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to control samples without obvious disease. RT activity was found within every brain sample, with a trend towards reductions in RT activity in the brains from terminal Alzheimer’s disease. This is consistent with the neuronal degeneration that is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the origins of this RT activity further, the scientists assessed multiple possible sources and identified long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1), an ancient genetic sequence so common in mammalian genomes that it makes up nearly one-fifth of all human DNA. It is normally inactive, but scientists have found rare forms that are active, using their own RTs to copy and paste themselves elsewhere in the genome.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prevailing thought has been that LINE1 can only function if expressed from an intact, bicistronic mRNA copy,” said Juliet Nicodemus, an MD-PhD student working in the Chun lab as part of the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of California San Diego and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, through the use of long-read sequencing of Alzheimer’s disease brains and normal brains, we found thousands of truncated versions of LINE1 expressed in the human brain, including hundreds of sequences not annotated in the human genome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to uncovering abbreviated versions of LINE1, the scientists found that most of these variations contained only one of the two protein-coding regions that appear on a full-length transcript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated that these shortened sequences with a single coding region, or ‘monocistronic’ transcripts, are capable of encoding reverse transcriptase activity,” said Chun. “The level of activity from sequence to sequence also varied dramatically amongst variants, beyond 50X.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists addressed their second major question regarding the types of cells with RT activity by comparing samples of neuron-rich gray matter with white matter that contains mostly glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“RT activity was significantly higher in gray matter,” said Nicodemus. “This is consistent with RT activity being predominantly found in neurons and has potentially widespread implications as our post-mitotic neurons accumulate DNA changes over an individual’s lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to continue learning more about the different versions of reverse transcriptase at work in the aging and especially Alzheimer’s disease brain,” added Chun. “This will allow more targeted treatments to be developed in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the proven safety of FDA-approved RT inhibitor drugs, Chun also suggests that physicians and scientists should pursue prospective clinical trials studying these drugs’ effects on persons with early Alzheimer’s disease as a near-term approach to helping Alzheimer’s disease patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Christine S.

L1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons bicistronically express ORF2, containing RT and endonuclease (EN) domains, and RNA binding protein ORF1, together enabling L1 retrotransposition and contributing to somatic genomic mosaicism (SGM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we assessed endogenous RT activities and L1 mRNA diversity from cerebral cortical samples of 31 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and non-diseased (ND) brains (both sexes) using enzymatic functional assays, targeted PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, and quantitative spatial transcriptomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expected bicistronic, full-length L1 transcripts were absent from most samples, constituting &amp;lt;0.01% of L1 sequences, of which &amp;gt;80% were non-coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monocistronic ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts were identified across all samples, consistent with quantitative spatial transcriptomics that identified discordant ORF2 and ORF1 expression in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All brains had RT activity, with AD samples showing less activity, consistent with neuronal loss of terminal AD vs. aged ND donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain RT activity was higher in grey matter and correlated with increased neuronal ORF2 expression, further supporting neuronal contributions. Remarkably, &amp;gt;550 protein-encoding, polyA+ ORF2 sequence variants were identified, over 2x more than identified in the human reference genome (hg38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental overexpression of full-length and truncated ORF2 variants revealed ∼50-fold RT and ∼1.3-fold EN activity ranges, supporting endogenous functional capacity of monocistronic ORF2 variants in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast sequence diversity of monocistronic ORF2 mRNAs could underlie functional differences in RT-mediated somatic gene recombination/retroinsertion and resulting genomic mosaicism in the normal and diseased brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:55:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9VN1dzWGRHVlNEOFE5bGVad3VVNDJmXzVVRFhsQ29qYXpSVVhOVy1CdGVoSGZYcV82UVZ4RExYOGZkdjBhVUxjUFJ0YUxyY0lqTE5xQXpyVi1fdEtja0RsT2JnVXNod1VlNS1hLUFVVFB2bTQ</guid></item><item><title>美国顶级夏季目的地处于红色警戒状态，因为患有世界上最具传染性疾病的旅行者感染了无数人-每日邮报 | Top US summer destination on red alert as traveler with world's most contagious disease infects untold number - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNOWhOTnEwNjhnbWlHdklwTlppUFJhZmVZa2QtVWhfQWYxRGlqQ3p1TzhJTXdvZHNlYVB3Z3NpaUp0bGxZUUQtYzNrR0d3dGY0N0xCSHM0cUlIUjhvcjBLdUxkVEhuX1JhVzZVLXFlTWZuTkZUSUgyRy0tVElBclJpVVN1WXEwQkhnNTdhR1JkQ28tcTI5UHJNOWlR0gGfAUFVX3lxTFA0NTNBVGYyV1dHMl9CTHA0N1VjMEVFcUc1cHQ5LXFkLURKNGVtcmFsRFlZYnlfbzlMZnhxS0k0eFJ6S21VcVdDRkJWR2lxb2tWV29QR3RMOFBDN3RsaW9kVjJzdVNxZ2dvUWlkTEZGQm9SSF9Ib3F5SjdZNzRneWxYaFVSUmdXNkRjWWZsN04wUTk4aEN6TTNyOEYwcjZQbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top US summer destination is on red alert after a traveler infected with the world's most contagious disease passed through the state, potentially infecting others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An adult passenger with an&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772281/US-map-measles-MMR-vaccine-rate-study.html"&gt; active case of measles &lt;/a&gt;traveled through Salt Lake City International Airport multiple times before Memorial Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After landing into Salt Lake City from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-aadd74d0-4212-11f0-856e-d9a98dd1fd0e"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; on May 19, they drove a rental vehicle to a hotel in Burley, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/idaho/index.html" id="mol-aaddc2f0-4212-11f0-856e-d9a98dd1fd0e"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, for a business trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four days later, they made the return journey home, taking the same method of transport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Passengers who were on the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775791/denver-airport-health-warning-infections-linked-disease-outbreak.html"&gt;individual's flights have &lt;/a&gt;been contacted by the Salt Lake County Health Department, as have guests who stayed at the same Burley hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another out-of-state resident infectious with measles also passed through the southwestern region of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-aade5f30-4212-11f0-856e-d9a98dd1fd0e"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; on May 26 and 27, which has heightened the cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;Utah officials are warning anyone&lt;/a&gt; who fears they may have been exposed to contact their health provider and monitor for symptoms in what is the latest in a string of measles scares to rock America's major airports and surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last reported measles infection in Utah - which is a popular tourist destination for its stunning National Parks including Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion - was in March of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top US summer destination is on red alert after a traveler infected with the world's most contagious disease passed through the state, potentially infecting others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:53:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNOWhOTnEwNjhnbWlHdklwTlppUFJhZmVZa2QtVWhfQWYxRGlqQ3p1TzhJTXdvZHNlYVB3Z3NpaUp0bGxZUUQtYzNrR0d3dGY0N0xCSHM0cUlIUjhvcjBLdUxkVEhuX1JhVzZVLXFlTWZuTkZUSUgyRy0tVElBclJpVVN1WXEwQkhnNTdhR1JkQ28tcTI5UHJNOWlR0gGfAUFVX3lxTFA0NTNBVGYyV1dHMl9CTHA0N1VjMEVFcUc1cHQ5LXFkLURKNGVtcmFsRFlZYnlfbzlMZnhxS0k0eFJ6S21VcVdDRkJWR2lxb2tWV29QR3RMOFBDN3RsaW9kVjJzdVNxZ2dvUWlkTEZGQm9SSF9Ib3F5SjdZNzRneWxYaFVSUmdXNkRjWWZsN04wUTk4aEN6TTNyOEYwcjZQbw</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪说“Charlatans”不是阻止未经证实的干细胞治疗的理由-纽约时报 | Kennedy Says ‘Charlatans’ Are No Reason to Block Unproven Stem Cell Treatments - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQcGFhTEN3TUlSX0NqOHY4WTZ0VUk1VXhod2Nja29xQzRFR1NoWUZ5eVcxRnpCTDB6WjR5LU41QWFfbVV6V0ZuOFp3MWhkVGJXVmFFdEVzeUFYLWZBOTVLaERZOHhTNGZJbFN5Z2ZSc3dzRjkydHlzOGg3LVpzWUZQNmJnZjF4SHJjZlhFQXlFNndDSG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F.

He said that would include stem cells, vitamins, peptides and chelation therapy, which involves removing heavy metals from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If you want to take an experimental drug — you can do that, you ought to be able to do that,” Mr. Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“And of course you’re going to get a lot of charlatans, and you’re going to get people who have bad results,” he added. “And ultimately, you can’t prevent that either way.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Kaiser Permanente Northern California reveal that adults aged 45 to 49 undergoing their first screening colonoscopy have neoplasia detection rates similar to those aged 50 to 54, supporting recent guideline changes to begin colorectal cancer screening earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Rising colorectal cancer rates among adults under 50 in the United States have prompted a shift in screening guidelines. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended starting age for routine &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer+screening/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer screening&lt;/a&gt; from 50 to 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Screening Colonoscopy Yields Among Adults Aged 45 to 49 Years After Lowering the Colon Cancer Screening Age," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2834893" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a screening cohort study to assess detection rates of colorectal neoplasia following the guideline change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cohort included 12,031 adults from Kaiser Permanente Northern California who underwent their first screening colonoscopy between 2021 and 2024. Participants were between 45 and 54 years old and had at least one year of health plan membership before screening. Individuals with a history of colorectal disease, incomplete procedures, or diagnostic indications were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary outcomes included the presence of any adenomas, advanced adenomas, sessile serrated &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lesions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt;, advanced serrated lesions, or colorectal cancer. Detection rates were compared between those aged 45 to 49 (n=4,380) and those aged 50 to 54 (n=7,651).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any adenoma was detected in 35.4% of the younger group and 40.8% of the older group, a statistically significant difference (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.90).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;All other outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between age groups. Advanced adenomas occurred in 3.8% of younger patients versus 4.1% of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older patients&lt;/a&gt; (aRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75–1.09), while &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; detection was rare and similar in both groups (0.1%; aRR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.15–2.07). Rates of sessile serrated lesions and advanced serrated lesions were also equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening colonoscopy among adults aged 45 to 49 produced neoplasia yields similar to those in older patients, particularly for clinically important lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that benchmarks for adenoma and serrated lesion detection do not require adjustment based on the inclusion of younger adults. Researchers conclude that the data support the current recommendation to initiate screening at age 45, offering evidence for its broader adoption across &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This gentle technique significantly improves cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage—a critical function that declines with age and contributes to cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used fluorescent tracers in mice and monkeys to uncover a new drainage pathway connecting facial lymphatics to deep lymph nodes, which remains intact even in older individuals. A handheld device that lightly strokes the skin restored youthful CSF flow in aged animals, opening up exciting potential for wearable treatments that prevent or slow neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Drainage Route:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists mapped a previously unknown CSF drainage pathway through facial lymphatics to submandibular nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Gentle mechanical stimulation of the face and neck enhanced CSF clearance without drugs or surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Proof Vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; Superficial facial lymphatics retain function in aging, making them ideal targets for therapeutic stimulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) have uncovered a non-invasive method to boost the brain’s natural waste drainage system—a discovery that could open new avenues for tackling age-related neurological disorders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Nature, researchers from the IBS Center for Vascular Research, led by Director KOH Gou Young, along with senior researchers JIN Hokyung, YOON Jin-Hui, and principal researcher HONG Seon Pyo, demonstrated that precisely stimulating the lymphatics under skin on the neck and face can significantly enhance the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—the liquid that cushions the brain and helps remove toxic waste—through lymphatic vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110671"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offers a new approach to clearing brain waste using safe, non-invasive mechanical stimulation, rather than relying on drugs or surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain produces waste at a high rate compared to other organs, and clearing it efficiently is essential for healthy brain function. This clearance is primarily carried out by CSF, which removes harmful substances such as amyloid-β and tau proteins—key factors in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, as we age, this drainage slows down, contributing to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBS Center for Vascular Research previously published landmark studies in Nature (2019 and 2024) demonstrating that CSF drains to deep cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatic vessels at the base of the skull and the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus. They also showed that age-related degeneration of these lymphatics impairs CSF clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team found that CSF drainage could be enhanced or suppressed pharmacologically by targeting cervical lymphatic vessels outside the skull. However, clinical applications remained limited because these lymphatics are located too deep in the neck for non-invasive access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research not only completed the map of cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways that clear brain waste, but also provided a new method to enhance CSF drainage from outside the brain,” stated KOH Gou Young, Center Director and corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect this will serve as a milestone for future research on neurodegenerative diseases including dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, using genetically modified mice and monkeys with fluorescent tracers, the researchers have mapped out a new CSF drainage route from the brain to superficial cervical lymph nodes—via a network of lymphatic vessels in the face, nose, and hard palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older animals, many of these routes had degenerated—except for the vessels just beneath the facial skin, which retained full functionality despite aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We confirmed that lymphatic vessels beneath facial skin connect to submandibular lymph nodes through various pathways,” explained JIN Hokyung, Senior Researcher and co-first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through these connections, we can regulate the reduced cerebrospinal fluid drainage function seen in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to determine how this newly identified pathway can be applied in actual patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this, the team developed a force-regulated mechanical stimulator—a handheld device that gently presses and strokes the skin in a controlled manner. When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased that we found a safer and more effective method to enhance cerebrospinal fluid drainage from outside the skull,” said YOON Jin-Hui, co-first author and neurovascular physiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are conducting follow-up studies to investigate how this newly identified drainage pathway is altered in various brain disease patients and how this new stimulation method can be applied therapeutically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique could pave the way for wearable or clinical devices that enhance brain waste clearance in older adults or patients with neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now investigating how this drainage system behaves in diseases like Alzheimer’s—and whether mechanical stimulation could serve as a preventive or therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by the biotech company Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, ENCELTO’s origins stem from a long-standing partnership between the Scripps Research lab of physician-scientist Martin Friedlander and the Lowy Medical Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the 17th FDA-approved therapy to emerge from work at Scripps Research. The device is expected to be available to U.S. patients in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Lowy family’s commitment to finding a treatment through their extraordinary support of the MacTel Project and the Lowy Medical Research Institute—combined with the work produced by Scripps Research, Neurotech, and an international consortium of scientists and clinicians—is a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of basic science in developing effective treatments for debilitating diseases,” says Friedlander, whose research, along with that of others, helped pave the way for ENCELTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacTel affects the central part of the retina, which is essential for sharp, detailed vision. People with the disease often have trouble reading, recognizing faces or seeing fine detail—symptoms that gradually worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To slow this progression, ENCELTO delivers a steady dose of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein that supports the survival and health of nerve cells—including photoreceptors in the retina. CNTF acts as a neuroprotectant, meaning it helps shield these cells from damage to delay the degenerative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s approval was supported by two phase 3 clinical studies showing that the ENCELTO implant slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells in people with MacTel over a 24-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devices removed from patients’ eyes after as long as 14.5 years still produced levels of CNTF comparable to what they were producing at the time of implantation, suggesting the device should remain efficacious well beyond the 2 years observed in the trials. This is being examined further in extended phase 4 trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time a cell-based therapy delivering a neuroprotectant has been approved to treat a neurodegenerative disease,” notes Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, Friedlander played an active role in shaping ENCELTO’s scientific foundation and helped lay the groundwork for its clinical development through earlier work from his Scripps Research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacTel was initially believed to be a blood vessel disorder because early imaging showed abnormal, leaky capillaries near the center of the retina. But Friedlander and his lab helped reveal that the real issue was neurodegeneration—the gradual death of photoreceptors and supporting glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a key proof-of-concept study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt; in 2009, they showed that gene therapy could be used to deliver a neuroprotectant directly to the retina in a preclinical model resembling the disease, effectively slowing or preventing cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This early success paved the way for further development of ENCELTO. A few years later, a member of the Lowy family was diagnosed with MacTel. The family’s search for a treatment became the driving force behind developing a lasting, targeted therapy for MacTel—which would eventually become ENCELTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on his 2009 findings, Friedlander began looking for a way to deliver CNTF to patients in a safe and sustained manner. He reconnected with Neurotech—a company he had worked with in the 1990s—to explore utilizing one of its devices originally developed to treat other retinal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they explored the use of a tiny, collagen-based capsule containing genetically modified retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which help nourish the retina and support photoreceptor health. Once implanted in the back of the eye, the device releases CNTF in a controlled, long-term way while shielding RPE cells from attack by the body’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENCELTO is also being evaluated for neurovascular degenerative conditions beyond MacTel. Friedlander’s lab is now exploring its potential to deliver other therapeutic molecules for diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The retina is an extension of the brain, so this also implies that a neuroprotectant could be used to prevent neurodegeneration in other diseases,” says Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that ENCELTO’s success is the culmination of years of research, persistence and problem-solving by many people—from the earliest lab studies to the final stages of clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no greater satisfaction for a clinician-scientist than to be able to find a treatment that will potentially impact hundreds of thousands of patients,” says Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s tremendously rewarding to take something from the lab bench and actually bring it to the bedside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89f9fbecfafac9faeafbe0f9f9faa7ecedfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Press Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scripps.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Press Office – Scripps Research Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:36:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9fZy1fVXRvaTRLejFqdG5DSjE1c25nV1F2NWo5ZWRhcVQ3SGNuMEVueVFuRFFHN1o2TGdRazJFNkpJeHQ2b2o1dUdHbDJrdXRKeEJ2NjMzUzhIU1NkdGMwYnBtOFBOdjZheTI0ZzBoNS1FZDhkQ280YjRUeVpyUHc</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性每年应该喝不超过六杯葡萄酒-《每日电讯报》 | Why women should drink no more than six glasses of wine a year - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5qVEVLRUpreTVOMUNNa2hYeW94QU9INU9vNlF1S2ZmTTh0R09FVFI0TDdoLTJ3TFJHU0pTNGdHa2pKZVhncmREeVdBT2h6U0ZycF9oTlAySjFvbjg5M2V6cl82aG4xVFk1UVNqcVREWkRTM2RnQTUwLUNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Women who drink four of these drinks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;over the course of a weekend, meanwhile, are at a 12 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink. Of 100 women who have four drinks of this size every weekend, around 13 would develop breast cancer over the course of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While having alcohol-free days can improve your health, there are added dangers to drinking large amounts of alcohol in one sitting, says Dr Rumgay. One study she worked on in the past found that “the risk of breast cancer was increased by 40 per cent in women that had had any occasion of heavy episodic drinking in the year leading up to the research,” she says. We might not think of it as such, but the WHO classes “heavy episodic drinking” or binge drinking as consuming 60g of pure alcohol or more in a single drinking session. That’s equivalent to just over two large glasses of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into the effects of weekend-only drinking is still ongoing, but “premenopausal women who binge drink seem to be twice as likely to develop breast cancer,” says Prof Stordal. “There is some confidence in the notion that having this carcinogenic compound in your system in high concentrations after a weekend of drinking could be more dangerous compared with having the same quantity over the course of a longer period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink a few times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink three times a week are at a 9 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink three times a week, around 12 would develop breast cancer over the course of their lives, not including other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a break between the days that you visit the pub or have a glass of wine with your dinner is certainly good for your health, says Dr Rumgay. “Drinking frequently can lead to systemic inflammation of the body,” she explains. “If you cut the number of days that you drink, or spread them out, then it’s possible that your body has more time to recover from this inflammatory state, which could potentially avoid increasing your risk of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even this amount of alcohol can increase your cancer risk, however. Another study that Dr Rumgay worked on found that “having just half a standard drink every day increases breast cancer risk by 4 per cent,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink once a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink once a week are at a 3 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink a week, around 11 would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke. The same amount of non-drinking women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 40 per cent of women in Britain drink at least once a week. The effects of having one drink each week are hard to study, however, as “most people either drink more than once a week or don’t drink at all,” says Dr Rumgay. The numbers still show that even this much alcohol consumption can increase your risk of breast cancer – though you might see a 3 per cent increased risk as something you’re willing to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink a few times a month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink every other week are at a 2 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink a few times a month, around would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors such as genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there isn’t a lot of research into this pattern of drinking, though “any amount of alcohol still increases your risk of breast cancer,” says Dr Rumgay. “The simple advice I always give is reduction,” says Prof Stordal. “Whether that’s cutting down to once a week or once every few weeks, whatever you can do will benefit you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink every few months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have fewer than six drinks over the course of a whole year are 0.3 per cent more likely to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/breast-cancer-symptoms-signs/"&gt;develop breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; than women who don’t drink. Of 100 women who have one drink fewer than six times a year, 11 would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while no amount of drinking is completely safe, you may be pleased to know that you can celebrate with a drink a few times a year and only increase your risk of breast cancer marginally, “though the general consensus is that anything more than zero does raise your risk,” says Dr Rumgay.&lt;/p&gt;

The CDC appeared to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;slightly soften Kennedyâ€™s guidance&lt;/a&gt;, saying that healthy kids and pregnant women â€œmayâ€� get boosters if their doctors recommend it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;The administration has tried to narrow the pool of people it says should get boosted. But where some of the changes reflect reasonable readings of the science, others do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah, a top CDC official during the Biden administration, said experts debate whether younger children should get boosted. When Shah was in government, he recommended it. But many other countries donâ€™t, noting that most young children have a low risk of serious illness. The mRNA technology used in some COVID shots can also have side effects, including a condition called myocarditis that mostly affects boys and young men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But Shah, who previously led Maineâ€™s CDC and is now at Colby College, says the evidence is much less debatable in the case of pregnant women. Not only are boosters safe and effective for them, but getting them protects babies in utero and up to 6 months old &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/"&gt;who canâ€™t get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The way Kennedy made the changes has also troubled experts. Normally, health agencies gather outside advisersâ€™ input before making new recommendations. But Kennedy seems to have acted unilaterally. His announcement, made in a minutelong social media video, &lt;a href="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit"&gt;surprised CDC officials&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;). â€œWhat it suggests is that some of the conclusions are foregone,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy argues that health experts made mistakes that undermined public trust during the pandemic. Shah acknowledges that, to a point. Some experts, he said, tried to squelch dissenting views or didnâ€™t effectively communicate that scientistsâ€™ understanding of COVID would evolve, causing confusion when public health guidance changed. Other experts overstated &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/ "&gt;the risk of outdoor transmission&lt;/a&gt; or supported extended school closures that caused severe learning loss &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;while doing little to contain infections&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the administrationâ€™s approach risks sowing further confusion. Kennedyâ€™s announcement conflicts with an article that two Trump-appointed FDA officials published days earlier, which listed pregnancy as one factor that puts women â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;at high risk for severe COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.â€� The fact that Kennedy â€” who has long spread vaccine misinformation and says he doesnâ€™t â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;think people should be taking medical advice from me&lt;/a&gt;â€� â€” made the changes could also corrode trust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhat worries me is that when we get into another emergency situation, if trust in federal health authorities has waned, thatâ€™s a problem,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, COVID keeps evolving. A variant called NB.1.8.1 has recently driven up cases in China and elsewhere. But for now, Shah isnâ€™t hugely concerned. NB.1.8.1 descended from Omicron, a variant that swept the United States in late 2021 and early 2022. So even if cases rise, existing vaccines and antibodies from prior infection will likely help protect against severe illness. The World Health Organization says the new variant â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;suggests no increased public health risk&lt;/a&gt;â€� so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;A few months ago, bird flu was spreading rapidly among cows and chickens, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;killing birds and other animals&lt;/a&gt;, and sickening dozens of people. Since then, the outbreak has slowed; the last reported human cases were in February, and only one person has died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;Bird flu may be seasonal, which &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-8857e56c7b91d82613042beaba169a31" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;could explain the ebb&lt;/a&gt;. But another possibility is that cases are going unreported because fewer people are getting tested. In February, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-fired-bird-flu-hires-00206334" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;fired, and then scrambled to rehire&lt;/a&gt;, officials involved in bird flu testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Given the uncertainty, some experts have faulted the administration for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707"&gt;canceling contracts with Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop a bird flu vaccine. The effort aimed to adapt the companyâ€™s versatile mRNA technology, which Kennedy has repeatedly cast doubt on despite overwhelming evidence of safety. (The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-moderna-covid-vaccine-rcna210250" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; a new mRNA COVID booster from Moderna last weekend.) Instead, the administration is funding a project aimed at developing a bird flu vaccine using technology &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;similar to seasonal flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which can take longer to produce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Cases of the highly contagious virus continue to rise nationwide, but slowly. The largest outbreak, in West Texas, seems to be abating. Three Americans have died this year, all unvaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;A slowing case rate is good news, although many more people could have gotten sick than the official numbers reflect. The measles vaccine is safe, highly effective, and decades old, but Kennedy was slow to full-throatedly recommend it as the outbreak grew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;ðŸ§© &lt;b&gt;3 Down:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9" title="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9"&gt;Repeat verbatim&lt;/a&gt; | â˜€ï¸� &lt;b&gt;90Â°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;Hot, humid, and hazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

            More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor’s offices — but also at a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/shakira-measles-new-jersey-texas-mmr-25022a0b7c69a23c27b0ccdbf818ee86" target="_blank"&gt;Shakira concert&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles060225.html" target="_blank"&gt;mall&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota, at a &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/02/25/measles-outbreak-exposure-texas-new-braunfels-buc-ees/80309897007/" target="_blank"&gt;Buc-ee’s store in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and in airports and planes in several states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000a3b6m7lgg9e6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;recently updated travel notice&lt;/a&gt;. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000b3b6mbyn4dfjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank"&gt; measles was declared eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/measles-elimination-declaration-2000-texas-new-mexico-vaccines-mmr/" target="_blank"&gt; 85 cases&lt;/a&gt; were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiekfyp00083b6mv63s7rz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieywbg000f3b6mm7vnvrpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiez6bs000h3b6majhmf2q5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000d3b6m7ffn9kth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000f3b6m2wc0jkqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000g3b6m92llb34j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbievnpb000j3b6mwkrncz8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000h3b6mm162fea5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000i3b6m5d5437aw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000j3b6m9psbirsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is not recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html#:~:text=Live%20virus%20vaccines%2C%20such%20as,also%20recommended%20for%20pregnant%20women." target="_blank"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifcsml000j3b6m9s9999j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifk29x000q3b6m9g9uc3po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000m3b6mfv3kh7dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000l3b6mac87ej4q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidvax900003b6m9a1hxsdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie5oxo00053b6mfxq26b20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiely3x000e3b6mywvyabk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieyo4v000d3b6mw7n53f9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie8r1m00073b6mjmih0k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/pack-smart" target="_blank"&gt;travel guidance&lt;/a&gt; such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list" target="_blank"&gt;country-specific travel health notices&lt;/a&gt; on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000n3b6m3a5cbal1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000o3b6m6lpffj8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5779523/" target="_blank"&gt;four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate&lt;/a&gt;. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000p3b6msvvvf0xh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieck5q00093b6mr84yusx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We’ve had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

This means she takes a whole-body approach to skin health, focusing on both external symptoms and internal triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;“We’re very skin cancer exam-oriented here,” she said, holding up two dermatoscopes — small, high-powered tools used to magnify and illuminate skin lesions. “Nothing escapes my eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-portrait" data-index="11"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: CatMax Photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: CatMax Photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;What ‘derms’ are looking for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="15"&gt;As she examined my skin, Erickson assessed each mole using the &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/find/at-risk/abcdes" target="_blank"&gt;ABCDE method&lt;/a&gt; — a checklist dermatologists use to spot early signs of melanoma. It stands for asymmetry, border, color, diameter and evolution. Basically, anything that’s oddly shaped, unevenly colored, larger than a pencil eraser or changing over time could raise a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="16"&gt;The mole I’ve silently obsessed over for years? Totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;“Melanoma typically presents as a new collection of abnormal pigment cells on the skin,” Erickson explained. “Sure, an old mole you have can become cancerous, but more commonly, melanoma is a new dark spot of cancerous melanocytes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;She also emphasized that skin cancer doesn’t just affect people who’ve spent years tanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="19"&gt;“Most melanoma, squamous cell and basal cell — I mean they’re from the sun,” she said. “But there is a subset of melanoma that’s not related to sun. The type that can grow on the feet, for example, or under the nails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;So, when should you start getting checked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="23"&gt;“Yearly, not really based on age. It changes based on what your skin does,” she said. “If someone comes in and every time we’re removing abnormal moles … we may recommend every six months." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;Because of my history of blistering sunburns as a teen, I’ll be returning annually. This schedule, according to Erickson, is recommended for most people with fair skin, a family history of skin cancer or a lot of moles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;What Erickson found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;First, the dot on my eyelid: not a sty, not skin cancer, but a common &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22786-cherry-angioma" target="_blank"&gt;cherry angioma&lt;/a&gt;, which is a tiny cluster of blood vessels. “These come and stay,” Erickson said. “Totally harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;Next, she zeroed in on my cheeks. Redness, bumps, dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;“Have you ever been told &lt;a href="https://georgiaskinspecialists.com/medical-dermatology/rosacea/" target="_blank"&gt;you have rosacea&lt;/a&gt; before?” she asked. I told her yes — once, during a questionable online consultation — but I’d always doubted the diagnosis. “Well,” she said gently, “I do think you have it. And we can treat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;She prescribed a topical cream and laid out a simple skin care plan. I’m to start using SPF 50 every morning, a hydrating moisturizer (like the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream I already use), and keeping an eye on common rosacea triggers, including spicy foods, cinnamon, tomatoes, citrus and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;The 411 on skin care in the sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="33"&gt;Erickson also gave me a crash course in SPF science, which is something every Georgia resident should probably get, including these simple tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="list b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use more SPF than you think you need:&lt;/b&gt; If you use the correct amount, a typical bottle should last just six full-body applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go mineral when you can:&lt;/b&gt; Zinc and titanium-based sunscreens are gentler on sensitive skin and for babies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing is key:&lt;/b&gt; A rash guard or UPF shirt is more reliable than reapplying sunscreen after every swim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="35"&gt;She also emphasized why patients need to supplement with vitamin D — especially those wearing sunscreen daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="37"&gt;“It’s technically a hormone, not a vitamin,” Erickson said. “It supports everything from bone health to immune function — even hair growth. And since I’m telling everybody to wear sunscreen, I’m also telling everybody to make sure they’re taking their vitamin D.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="41"&gt;I walked in fearing the unknown. I walked out feeling more in control of my skin than I ever have. It was quick, painless and surprisingly empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="42"&gt;“The most important step,” Erickson told me, “is just getting in the door. It’s always scarier in your head.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="43"&gt;Although my skin concerns turned out to be manageable — and I left the appointment cancer-free — the visit was a good reminder of why these checks matter. Even if you don’t have a glaring issue, a quick scan could catch something serious before it becomes dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:54:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNenlPWWF1aVdKbXRVYTktc2JyZkdNU2ppVXl2am1WSzNzdE1xNVFLTTRsWHVCS2c5Ti1vbFFNUGNQenh6V2JuRGNIZVdhcTB3NXE0MUZFa2hoUE56ZFZUdXd2aGVwSXppUXc4U3oza0RpLVp1dVVucy1UemRhQlFNMUxpM1FsZV9nbVQ1TjdwRGdYckRORnE3S2FQbHJYMWZf</guid></item><item><title>肾脏科医生分享了一些迹象，以了解您的肾脏是否不健康： “体重减轻和对肿胀的胃口不佳……” -《印度斯坦时报》 | Nephrologist shares signs to know if your kidneys are not healthy: 'Weight loss and poor appetite to swelling in…' - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/nephrologist-shares-signs-to-know-if-your-kidneys-are-not-healthy-weight-loss-and-poor-appetite-to-swelling-101749117190225.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.theisn.org/more-than-850-million-worldwide-have-some-form-of-kidney-disease-help-raise-awareness/" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="International Society of Nephrology"&gt;International Society of Nephrology&lt;/a&gt;, more than 850 million worldwide have some form of kidney disease. Moreover, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease worldwide is 10.4 percent among men and 11.8 percent among women. Moreover, our fast-paced lifestyle and unhealthy food choices are also having an impact on kidney health.

Kidney disease is often diagnosed incidentally during routine blood or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/urologist-reveals-the-one-trick-to-check-your-kidney-health-without-any-test-101748933204888.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="urine tests"&gt;urine tests&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions. Kidney damage may not show symptoms until function is significantly impaired, making early detection vital. Often, symptoms remain vague and nonspecific until the later stages of kidney disease,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/13/original/shutterstock_2215941219_1741857847657.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Kidney disease is often diagnosed incidentally during routine blood or urine tests for other conditions.

As men lose weight, their penises appear larger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One unidentified male who has been using Ozempic has explained how he noticed a difference down there after taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Taking to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, the man penned: "I recently measured myself down there and noticed I gained about 1 inch. Now I think people will say it was because of the fat loss, however at the time I measured myself before 4 years ago was thinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I also bone pressed during measurement before and also this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There is obviously a lot of talk surrounding penis size, but it's important to remember that in &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; terms, the size of one's manhood really doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to Diabetes.co.uk once more, pharmacist Navin Khosla said: “While the data is interesting, penis size doesn’t matter in a medical sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Just like how some people prefer different fashion styles, eye colours, or characteristics in a partner, some people are more attracted to larger penises or breasts, while others prefer smaller ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A man has shared his experience after using Ozempic  (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While Ozempic has become popular, the long-term effects of taking the drugs, particularly on muscle loss, remain unclear at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;After people conclude taking a course of Ozempic, Dr Ben Bickman, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/science"&gt;scientist&lt;/a&gt; and professor at Brigham Young University in Utah, explained how many immediately put weight back on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Ozempic is effective at reducing cravings... however well this works, it works until it doesn't," the expert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"At around two years of use, people find that the sweet cravings return to normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:43:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQWHhfMVBGUnFPcmMwNkYwVEFVQW1jZDBUVzFBMHlPczEydGJUZmpMbnNXcDZ2UFdwaFZxZkpxSHpVZkloVDVHYk4yempLeFpfMUNVUjRKNFVmMnEzQ3dTSF8zbk1PMmJQS2tjd0NGQU0yMkVTd0hLNE53eEdndnZoZFdmZWh4YjM2eFJzZEpBZVNhLTRqdHc</guid></item><item><title>医生和科学家正在揭示人们没有意识到的对他们的健康非常不利的事情- BuzzFeed | Doctors And Scientists Are Revealing Things People Don't Realize Are Wildly Bad For Their Health - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNOGdoc0FoYWxVYWJEb20zZU1hNzI2ODUwSldRZ2Jza1FFcG1hTks0M0QtQTJQeGkyclJWUWpVRGplUzdrNjNvT1NJQk9jSXRQdF9jVzlLM0hmSUZSWUJOTVFqRktjbHItYzNNenR0X09YRUhBRHI5a3RqVFUxQmpPb3BUV0RjcW9wNXZZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Most people barely move or consider a slow walk exercise. Daily physical activity of doing chores, walking to the store, etc. are the bare minimum amounts of movement. People use lifts to go up one or two flights of stairs, get delivery, or use the drive-thru to avoid doing even that. Let alone purposeful exercise that would make you out of breath and get your heart rate up. &lt;b&gt;The cheapest way to reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attacks, cancer, strokes, sleep apnoea, joint disease, mental health disorders, and pretty much most other disorders? A brisk walk/jog of 30 to 60 minutes five times a week."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17vrtur/doctors_of_reddit_whats_the_worst_thing_you_can/k9e0n65/" target="_blank"&gt;pineappleandpea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dream that Mikael Genberg has nurtured for more than a quarter century could come true today (June 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish artist's "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/moonhouse-artwork-mikael-genberg-ispace" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/moonhouse-artwork-mikael-genberg-ispace"&gt;Moonhouse&lt;/a&gt;," a project he devised way back in 1999, is set to touch down on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html"&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon aboard &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/japanese-company-ispace-will-attempt-historic-moon-landing-on-june-5" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/japanese-company-ispace-will-attempt-historic-moon-landing-on-june-5"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt;, a lander operated by the Japanese company ispace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artwork — a tiny replica of the red-and-white houses that dot the Swedish countryside — is mounted on the front bumper of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/ispace-mini-moon-rover-tenacious" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/ispace-mini-moon-rover-tenacious"&gt;Tenacious&lt;/a&gt;, a microrover built by ispace's European subsidiary. If Resilience touches down safely today and everything thereafter goes to plan as well, Tenacious will deploy from the lander and drop the Moonhouse onto the lunar dirt, giving the gray landscape a solitary spark of vibrant color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space.com caught up with Genberg via email recently to discuss the Moonhouse, how he's feeling with the touchdown try just around the corner and what a successful landing would mean to him. The questions and answers are presented below in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;"The Moonhouse" artist Mikael Genberg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: The Moonhouse/Mathias Nordgren)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: How and when did you first get the idea to put a little Swedish house on the moon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikael Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;Working as an artist is, in many ways, about trying to describe the world, life, and human beings from different perspectives. All culture is essentially that: describing and re-describing what it means to be here. The house, as a symbol, holds in my mind a unique combination of survival and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first imagined a typical Swedish house standing on the moon, I instantly felt the power of the image, but also its impossibility. I had no competence, no funding, no connections. Still, the thought didn’t leave me. I started talking about it, first with close friends, then with others. Gradually, a sense of shared purpose, or something like that, began to form around the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KrhZc67tqxUANDgbvgEy9U" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KrhZc67tqxUANDgbvgEy9U slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the concept managed to survive, and even grow, for 26 years, carried forward by its own poetry, craziness and hardship and by the incredible support of people who believed in it. That persistence of the idea itself is kind of an artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What does this piece mean to you? What do you hope it achieves, or how do you hope it affects people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg:&lt;/strong&gt; To me, the Moonhouse is both a shared achievement, something made possible by the efforts of many individuals, but also a profoundly personal thing. Being able to touch the moon with a small house that I painted in the kitchen of our red house from 1758 creates deeper emotions than I expected. It’s like putting my finger on that distant white disc in the sky. An impossibility that comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a small house in a vast, empty place, a symbol of belonging, curiosity, and vulnerability. I hope it invites people to reflect on our relationship to space, and to recognize the fragility and uniqueness of our own world, this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/pale-blue-dot-voyager-1-photo-30th-anniversary.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/pale-blue-dot-voyager-1-photo-30th-anniversary.html"&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt;, packed with life, all related to each other. The Moonhouse doesn’t claim anything except maybe to be art, but even that is of no real interest. It’s a small red house standing on the moon. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: How do you feel now, being so close to the lunar landing? What emotions are running through you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a strange mix of awe, anxiety, disbelief, and sheer, childish happiness. So many things have had to go right just to reach this point. There's excitement, of course, but also a deep sense of humility in understanding the challenges that still lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying not to get swept away by the emotions entirely, but instead to stay present in this moment. Whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What would mission success — Tenacious deploying the Moonhouse onto the gray dirt — mean to you? What would it mean to humanity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;If it works, if the Moonhouse actually stands there on the lunar surface, I think it would be a moment of something extraordinary. Maybe more poetry than art. For me personally, it would be the culmination of imagination, persistence, and collaboration with so many wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for what it might mean to humanity, that's really up to each person. I love that people have already responded in their own creative ways: sending us songs, children's drawings, poems. That, to me, is success, when an idea sparks new ideas in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope the Moonhouse can become a small cultural marker. Something that says: we were here, and we brought not just our technology, but our dreams, our symbols of home. We come in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What if Resilience fails during its landing attempt on June 5? Will you still regard the Moonhouse project as a success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;That's hard to say. In the moment, I'm sure I would feel deep disappointment. But with some distance, I believe I'll be able to see how the Moonhouse has already succeeded in many ways. It exists. It was built. It sparked thoughts, conversations and creativity across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I hope it lands safely. But I also accept that space missions are, by nature, super-risky. No matter what happens, the House will reach the moon. The only question is in what shape.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;On May 14, 2025, the Division of Overdose Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/10/05/overdose-may-be-decreasing--but-not-for-everyone/" target="_blank"&gt;overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-statement-from-cdcs-national-center-for-injury-prevention-and-control-on-provisional-2024.html"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 27%. This was an extraordinary, even historic announcement, given overdoses had risen relentlessly for more than 33 years, resulting in the deaths of more than a million Americans, with another 1 million projected to die before this decade is over. Now, for more than a year, overdose deaths have decreased every single month, most dramatically for deaths caused by &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/fentanyl" target="_blank"&gt;illicit fentanyl&lt;/a&gt; — considered the toughest problem, given the opioid’s high potency, simplicity of manufacture, and ease of smuggling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very same day, the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/14/rfk-jr-congress-testimony/"&gt;testimony before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, made no reference to overdoses, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-statement-from-cdcs-national-center-for-injury-prevention-and-control-on-provisional-2024.html"&gt;number one killer of Americans 18 to 44 years of age&lt;/a&gt;, nor to the recent success. A week later, in his agency’s 72-page “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf"&gt;Making America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” manifesto, the word “opioid” was never mentioned. Instead, he went on to propose that CDC should be disassembled, along with the other principal agencies responsible for addressing the overdose crisis.  Those proposals, as part of the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf"&gt;2026 fiscal year budget&lt;/a&gt;,  passed the House and await action by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly thirty years I was a CDC scientist. I have been outspokenly critical of how CDC and those other agencies have handled the opioid crisis, but the solution is not to take a wrecking ball to the institutions that protect us, particularly when we seem to be making progress. What will be the consequences? A health secretary who systematically ignores mention of the major killer of adult Americans is clearly not interested in research on what could account for a decrease in deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But among recent national initiatives, the push to increase availability of the opioid overdose antidote, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/05/16/why-everyone-should-learn-how-to-administer-naloxone/" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt; (brand name Narcan), has clearly played a role. Between 2021 and 2023, the number of naloxone doses dispensed from retail pharmacies doubled, &lt;a href="https://end-overdose-epidemic.org/highlights/ama-reports/2024-report/"&gt;and millions of additional doses were distributed by harm reduction organizations&lt;/a&gt;. Then in March 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray"&gt;over-the-counter distribution of a nasal spray version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been outspokenly critical of how CDC and those other agencies have handled the opioid crisis, but the solution is not to take a wrecking ball to the institutions that protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, &lt;a href="https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/emergent-biosolutions-continues-broaden-access-awareness-and"&gt;20 million doses had been dispensed&lt;/a&gt;. The decline in overdose death rates started the month after the nasal spray became widely available. Temporal sequence is not causation, but in a public health crisis, a plausible step is mass distribution of an antidote easily administered by lay persons. Few interventions in medicine are more cost-effective than saving a life in ten seconds for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after being put in charge of the U.S. health care system in February 2025, Kennedy, called for &lt;a href="https://washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/02/trump-naloxone-overdose-funding-cuts"&gt;immediate decreased funding for naloxone&lt;/a&gt;. And he didn’t stop there. Slated for &lt;a href="https://fabbs.org/news/2025/04/hhs-budget-leaked-includes-nih-reorganization/"&gt;abolition is the National Institute for Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, the research group at the National Institutes of Health that helped develop the nasal version of naloxone. NIDA is currently researching opioid analgesics with lower addiction risk and developing wastewater detection systems to provide early warning of new illicit drugs. What is left of NIDA will be absorbed, with other decimated institutes, into a single entity focused on “behavioral health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the chopping block is the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hhs-addiction-mental-health-rfk-samsha-e83db20b4ef801971cd25d07eb41bcf9"&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which provides the major funding for state and local naloxone distribution and drug treatment programs. CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention, which is responsible for monitoring the drug epidemic, is marked for demolition too, despite having just reported the unprecedented reduction in overdose deaths. Adding to the threat of a renewed overdose explosion, the CDC issued the stark warning of a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7348a2.htm"&gt;seven-fold rise in overdoses from illicit carfentanil&lt;/a&gt;, an opioid 100 times more potent than fentanyl — so potent that the drug is used to sedate elephants and minuscule amounts can easily kill a person. Remnants of SAMHSA and the CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention will be folded into the new “Agency for Healthy America." Even if we assume that every cent of the budgets of the &lt;a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/samhsa-fy-2025-cj.pdf"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/budget-information/fiscal-year-2025-budget-information-congressional-justification-national-institute-drug-abuse"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/budget-funding/overdose-prevention-funding.html"&gt;drug control groups&lt;/a&gt; is eliminated, the total reduction in the &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-does-the-us-federal-government-spend/country/united-states/"&gt;federal budget&lt;/a&gt; would be one-tenth of one percent, or considerably less than the cost of one &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/meet-the-navys-new-13-billion-aircraft-carrier/"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, these &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/05/20/federal-workers-trump-mental-health/"&gt;transformations&lt;/a&gt; should be done in a way to assure that the federal workforce will “be traumatically affected,” and “viewed as the villains.” What should the few remaining traumatically affected villains do about the drug crisis? Kennedy, who attributes his heroin recovery to 12-step abstinence, made that clear in his 2024 documentary: “We’re going to build hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/28/there-is-no-evidence-rfk-jrs-plan-for-healing-farms-somehow-helps-people-quit/" target="_blank"&gt;healing farms&lt;/a&gt;” — places where people with addiction “learn the discipline of hard work” and “get re-parented,” all the while bringing “a new industry to these forgotten corners of America.” Antidotes, treatment, prevention? These are at best irrelevant — more likely, a moral hazard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you learn in public health is that all victories are temporary. Back in 2000, the CDC group where I worked demonstrated that ongoing transmission of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; — the most infectious pathogen known to humankind — had been eliminated from the U.S., thanks to nationwide hard work to raise immunization levels. A quarter-century later, because of lowered immunization levels consequent to a torrent of vaccine misinformation by Kennedy and others, there have been more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,000 measles cases in 30 states&lt;/a&gt; over the first five months of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is now before Congress: If the agencies battling the drug epidemic are disabled, will a renewed explosion of deaths result? The last time the current president was in office, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"&gt;overdose rates rose more than 44%&lt;/a&gt; over the course of his tenure — the largest overdose increase in American history, with more than 300,000 lives lost. This time, we may never know if history is repeating itself since the systems that monitor overdose deaths are themselves subject to elimination. However, families of future overdose victims may still wonder if 2025 was the year we helped make Americans die again.&lt;/p&gt;

The variant, which was first discovered in China earlier this year, currently accounts for 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences tested from around the world, according to recent &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DU6FHVGHHZHBXCWXWEHF5PUEAQ"&gt;That’s a huge leap from 2.5% four weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LHCEUEY6UNH4BLTL6547VQNLII"&gt;A Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency is in regular contact with international partners about the activity of NB.1.8.1. Currently, only 20 NB.1.8.1 sequences have been identified in the US – which is below the threshold that’s needed for a variant to appear on &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variants-genomic-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variants-genomic-surveillance"&gt;the agency’s COVID dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FHM5BDMOFBSVABEKKXMQPJPAQ"&gt;The spokesperson even added that as soon as its prevalence increases, the new variant would show up on the tracker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HDB3IOZQQRBS5DF3UJKXR4XJ64"&gt;One important thing to note: according to infectious disease specialists, there are no alarming differences between the symptoms of NB.1.8.1 and those caused by other versions of SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OOGV6KR77FGXJP26OUUY27IDJI"&gt;“Currently, it appears that NB.1.8.1 would have similar symptoms to other COVID variants that have recently been circulating,” &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrix.com/find-care/doctors/hoy-zachary-1629399019" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dr. Zachary Hoy,&lt;/a&gt; a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="D2CZWWEWEJG6ZH7DKUR24RTXF4"&gt;Here’s what you should know about the newest COVID variant that’s making its rounds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3QHAFMV4EFGLPMGT6EAQ6O3XRQ"&gt;Compared to the current variant that’s dominating the U.S., which is LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1has multiple new mutations on the spike protein that could enhance its ability to bind to our cells, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BBAI4LTNMNGPZD6SRUX4P5KSMM"&gt;These mutations could increase the virus’ transmissibility and potentially diminish the effectiveness of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706198/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706198/"&gt;neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that prevent pathogens from latching to our cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AP6QB73WMNHTFDEWIESR44JE5M"&gt;In simpler terms, the variant could be skilled at evading some of our defenses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WWGS54YCFBHVNJAE5DFWWXXFXU"&gt;When it comes to the signs and symptoms of the new variant, NB.1.8’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are the same as those seen with SARS-CoV-2 variants, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja"&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3XXGSVZJQBHKDFLYC4ZBMUFYQA"&gt;Two of COVID’s telltale symptoms are a mild, but persistent dry cough and nasal congestion. However, many people who come down with the virus also experience fatigue and tiredness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKTKZKHMXFCSHNG4DEA2DFM3FA"&gt;“An infected person can still make it through the day, but they are resting more and feel more tired throughout the day,” Hoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FQMY5ZXD7RDQPGBZQER6CV5BUY"&gt;Other common symptoms include fever, chills, a sore throat, and muscle aches. “Some have described recent variants as less intense symptoms as compared to wintertime influenza viruses, but both can have severe symptoms,” Hoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HT5HIRBDKNEOPLZUYLIOEZP2SU"&gt;Also,&lt;a href="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ntd.com/china-faces-covid-19-resurgence-with-symptoms-of-sharp-burning-sore-throat_1068671.html"&gt; &lt;b&gt;reports out of China &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;where it has spiked say it comes with a very painful side effect — “razor blade throat,” which is described as feeling like you “swallowed shattered glass or razor blades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XHV5PETPNNGBFOHVXECXGUQQIU"&gt;Right now, there’s no evidence that suggests the variant causes more severe disease or an uptick in hospitalizations or deaths, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; states. According to Adalja, the only noticeable aspect, as of now, is that its rising in prevalence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RYFPKWFH3FBSHA2EQNN3XC637E"&gt;As for if the vaccines are effective against NB.1.8.1, its currently too early to know how effective the shots are, as research is limited since the variant is so new, but scientists are expecting the shots to hold up well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M2RPJF72ARF7RGI566JNFILIY4"&gt;“The ability of the vaccines to prevent severe illness is intact, though protection versus infection is limited and transient,” Adalja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ENXMHMVYNVD4DJ2G4Q5CT66I2M"&gt;Therefore, anyone who is at risk of severe disease should stay up-to-date with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H2RIYMNKI5FVLHJPY6PNJF2SVY"&gt;“Those in older populations or with underlying immune disorders or on immune-decreasing medications would benefit more from vaccination, or those with increased exposure, such as healthcare workers,” Hoy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:3ORCVPQEOFGBFJQIVO6WLDILYA" data-fusion-component="3ORCVPQEOFGBFJQIVO6WLDILYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:3ORCVPQEOFGBFJQIVO6WLDILYA" data-fusion-component="3ORCVPQEOFGBFJQIVO6WLDILYA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BCOUQV6JM5BRTM4WXXWLDIRGX4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PennLive.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNRHZOQjRKOWdKMS1iVW9xQlR0c3p1dW9HWHFoeUt3ejktVWo3M2h1XzQ1clB5Szd1WG5CSlhNbWd2d2dqWUt5ZUVuWHZoMWtQdlJXeWJEUjhaS2VRS05EeDl1QzEySDBVbVdJTm4zNDdKNWJLekh0blpyYlFNU2ZHMmQ5aXI2MXNTWE4wd1BPU010V2JKNkYyQVdYNXNxVGY0bFN6LTJMRdIBuwFBVV95cUxPREVxeHZvaXBDamRzMGVzMzdqbGRNcGpfVFBRdlVQa1BjMnhNeFUtOUNIZ2FoTGMzbkJqT2V1MmNXNTdmX0NsVXdZT3hvbDNoeUcwd2VPWW5fV21RZEFuNlFGdF9VYnEwV2ticzlNQW1MT2JtZ2RGQ2p5Slg3cXBzbEVNY19NTTN6YVg5UnBtX0lPZGtwdG8xcHZFRVJ6dml1TU84cjZCV19ibVIwSTFEQ0tWOWo0SFJ3Ry1n</guid></item><item><title>艾滋病毒治疗“以前认为不可能”的重大突破-独立报 | Major breakthrough in battle for HIV cure ‘previously thought impossible’ - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOOGRtZUlVYUtOY0x1bG4tWG5jbExnQmI5emV2Y0x0MGRXWjJ1MDVQRWl0X3diall6NENKNlJWX0lYZEU4LW5oYnRrOEg0eXpaaGdRRktNZG9QbndYanFCNDViVnQxclRKV2J0WWNzWEViMW5kVjRWRWN4eG1fU3NkVWFjeko0THB4YmJPckNnUGN3aXFFcHBr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the paper that the team initially thought the results were “too good to be true”, adding that they hoped the new nanoparticle design could be a “new pathway to an HIV cure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="HIV can ‘hide’ itself in white blood cells, meaning the immune system and treatment drugs is unable to find and tackle them." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-51323"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;HIV can ‘hide’ itself in white blood cells, meaning the immune system and treatment drugs is unable to find and tackle them.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic – that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was done using cells donated by HIV patients. More research will now have to be done to see if the steps taken to reveal the virus will result in the body’s immune system will be able to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will likely take years of further safety testing before the new discovery could be used in human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 08:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOOGRtZUlVYUtOY0x1bG4tWG5jbExnQmI5emV2Y0x0MGRXWjJ1MDVQRWl0X3diall6NENKNlJWX0lYZEU4LW5oYnRrOEg0eXpaaGdRRktNZG9QbndYanFCNDViVnQxclRKV2J0WWNzWEViMW5kVjRWRWN4eG1fU3NkVWFjeko0THB4YmJPckNnUGN3aXFFcHBr</guid></item><item><title>普拉提教练说，如果您练习这两种类型的拉伸，您将改善您的移动方式- Fit&amp;Well | A Pilates instructor says you’ll improve how you move if you practice these two types of stretches - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxPUXQxRGswRENXTG1YelUteExFN0EwVWt2Y0xqZXdvZDRvU2ViMXVmSmpYdXB1R3F2THlHdWNybDhJNFduRWJfejd0Rm1yYmZ6cVduZEpKOURRT0pSMnBZMUVoRi1UblgzUS1rblBWUjBiaVdZb0hTanpCYjM0VWdTLXlIWVotRG1sUlhSZVQxSUgyLVN1cTE0eTVRV1lxazhVRFNFME1mNHVSeDk4QjhJNllmUW9qaTU1MGpneFdSWlVNM2x3a0RyVW1XLThmakItcGlqd0FOcDE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know stretching is good for us—that’s why it feels so good—but did you know that there are two types of stretch that have different benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static stretching involves holding a stretch and lengthening a muscle for an extended period of time, while dynamic stretching uses controlled and active movement to increase mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Jill Drummond, a NASM-certified Pilates instructor and personal trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bodybarpilates.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bodybarpilates.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BODYBAR Pilates&lt;/a&gt; to understand the differences, and Drummond shared a routine that combines both types to help you develop your overall mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a static stretch?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Static stretching is what most people envision when they think of stretching—it involves holding a position for 30 to 60 seconds to target a specific muscle,” says Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of stretching helps elongate muscles, increase range of motion and alleviate stiffness and soreness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static stretches are also great for increased blood flow, reduced muscle tension and stress, and enhanced relaxation and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a dynamic stretch?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic stretching, a fundamental component of Pilates, involves controlled, active movements that take joints and muscles through their full range of motion,” says Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These movements mimic real-life activities, helping to improve mobility and overall joint function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic stretching contributes to improved blood circulation, reduced stiffness in muscles and joints, enhanced flexibility and mobility, better performance in daily activities and workouts and injury prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best results, you should combine both static and dynamic stretches in your routine. This balanced approach promotes flexibility, mobility, and overall functional movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-15-minute-stretching-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;15-minute stretching routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drummond says that committing to just 15-20 minutes of mobility-focused movement each day can improve your flexibility, mobility and overall movement quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she advises that if you’re just beginning your mobility journey, you should start with three stretching sessions a week, as you may experience some soreness as your body adapts. Gradually increase to five to seven sessions a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-bridge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

It means there is a reservoir of the HIV in the body, capable of reactivation, that neither the immune system nor drugs can tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"global-development","tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","type":"Keyword","title":"Global development"},{"id":"global-development/global-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Global health"},{"id":"society/aids-and-hiv","type":"Keyword","title":"Aids and HIV"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/kat-lay","type":"Contributor","title":"Kat Lay"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/global-development","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Global Development"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, have demonstrated a way to make the virus visible, paving the way to fully clear it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is based on mRNA technology, which came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/01/flu-cancer-hiv-after-covid-success-what-next-for-mrna-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;when it was used in vaccines&lt;/a&gt; made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers have shown for the first time that mRNA can be delivered into the cells where HIV is hiding, by encasing it in a tiny, specially formulated fat bubble. The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Globally, there are &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost 40 million people&lt;/a&gt; living with HIV, who must take medication for the rest of their lives in order to suppress the virus and ensure they do not develop symptoms or transmit it. For many it remains deadly, with UNAids figures suggesting one person died of HIV every minute in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was “previously thought impossible” to deliver mRNA to the type of white blood cell that is home to HIV, said Dr Paula Cevaal, research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study, because those cells did not take up the fat bubbles, or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), used to carry it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team have developed a new type of LNP that those cells will accept, known as LNP X. She said: “Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When a colleague first presented test results at the lab’s weekly meeting, Cevaal said, they seemed too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good. So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research will be needed to determine whether revealing the virus is enough to allow the body’s immune system to deal with it, or whether the technology will need to be combined with other therapies to eliminate HIV from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study is laboratory based and was carried out in cells donated by HIV patients. The path to using the technology as part of a cure for patients is long, and would require successful tests in animals followed by safety trials in humans, likely to take years, before efficacy trials could even begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic – that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,” stressed Cevaal. “But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Michael Roche of the University of Melbourne and co-senior author of the research, said the discovery could have broader implications beyond HIV, with the relevant white blood cells also involved in other diseases including cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jonathan Stoye, a retrovirologist and emeritus scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the approach taken by the Melbourne team appeared be a major advance on existing strategies to force the virus out of hiding, but further studies would be needed to determine how best to kill it after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added: “Ultimately, one big unknown remains. Do you need to eliminate the entire reservoir for success or just the major part? If just 10% of the latent reservoir survives will that be sufficient to seed new infection? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, that does not detract from the significance of the current study, which represents a major potential advance in delivery of mRNA for therapeutic purposes to blood cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tomáš Hanke of the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, disputed the idea that getting RNA into white blood cells had been a significant challenge. He said the hope that all cells in the body where HIV was hiding could be reached in this way was “merely a dream”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 05:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPYm45c0VSS3llblk1QU81MDhLT1RsTlpRYzUxYjFXc1FDSGlodlU0WE1IR21JSVFBalJTZldZS2tINEd2cTRfSlppM004a3RoWUJuU3REQXYyM090Um1TODc0OVZPYlE0cFVqeDlDcVluRS02aWlVbkhJbWhvWDcwNzI1b25hQXJySmlMY19tX2Y0dGNDeThXcHV4dG54VXRxRWliUWxqWlFsRFFUWU1mTy1weWVIemlJRkNTTHM5ZnFVdG8</guid></item><item><title>我尝试了这个“5-2-4 fartlek”步行锻炼一周—这是一个改变游戏规则的人-汤姆的指南 | I tried this '5-2-4 fartlek' walking workout for a week — and it’s a game-changer - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPOS1NVTkxdFQwcWV4b0xONUNMZEZ4c2wyM3drTVdQNHFqZlJ3MjZfMnZhTTFuWmVJTGZsR3BaZGdHbVVkM25RS1Z5WDhqQUlmUVY3V0tBV09MbDIzSU5YY0JwbmtCQzRKZ3BkU0hyaE1aYnlDN0s4Q3BoemRTeHZiLVJELVR2Sk9GTml5NnhCTmNnUXU3NGJKOElPN3NxUGVrcEZaWFVpZ195UjZnLVNPNDl3aWdFX2t0SXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking workouts are all the rage at the moment — from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt; for your mental health, to the military-inspired &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-i-tried-rucking-instead-of-regular-walking-for-one-week-and-its-a-game-changer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-i-tried-rucking-instead-of-regular-walking-for-one-week-and-its-a-game-changer"&gt;rucking technique&lt;/a&gt; to build muscle. But one form of walking workout making headlines is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking Training&lt;/a&gt; (IWT), which promises to burn more fat and lower your blood pressure by alternating your pace. Unlike walking 10,000 steps, this science-based method raises your heart rate and boosts your cardiovascular fitness in less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an entirely new phenomenon, however. "Fartlek" walking has been around for a while, and translates to ‘speed play’ from the native Swedish. It’s all about varying the pace and difficulty throughout your walk, mixing intervals of faster-paced walks with slower rambles, allowing you to catch your breath. A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1715531224000115?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1715531224000115?utm_source=chatgpt.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that alternating periods of brisk and slow walking speeds can improve cardiovascular fitness, boost your overall fitness, and help control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen to give a new workout a try, I built my own fartlek walking session, and repeated it every morning for seven days. Read on to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-5-2-4-walking-workout-3"&gt;What is the 5-2-4 walking workout? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to get walking? Here’s the workout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm-up:&lt;/strong&gt; For me, this was a five-minute walk at a reasonable pace, but it might be some bodyweight exercises or stretching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 minutes:&lt;/strong&gt; Walking at a brisk pace, this is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 minutes:&lt;/strong&gt; Recovery walk at a slower pace. This should be a 4/10 effort max — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you, and your heart rate and breathing should return to normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat four times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the warm-up, this workout took me around 30 minutes every morning. I programmed the workout onto my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10 &lt;/a&gt;to avoid having to look at my wrist every few minutes — my watch would buzz when it was time to switch pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this workout is suitable for all levels, as you’re walking speed will be based on your exertion levels, if you’re new to fitness, or you’re returning to exercise following an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to speak to your doctor before taking on a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-tried-this-5-2-4-fartlek-walking-workout-for-a-week-and-it-s-a-game-changer-3"&gt;I tried this 5-2-4 fartlek walking workout for a week — and it’s a game-changer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s my verdict after a week of walking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-W5YcNqZ6Fpo4gD98YStFrV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-W5YcNqZ6Fpo4gD98YStFrV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-was-a-step-up-from-the-japanese-walking-method"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a step up from the Japanese walking method &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t tried it, the Japanese Interval Walking Training method involves three minutes at a low intensity, then three minutes walking at a high intensity for 30 minutes. This was a slight step up, as the high-intensity part of the workout was longer, and the recovery blocks were shorter. I found that I didn’t have long to catch my breath before I was picking up the pace again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally loved the extra challenge of walking at a brisk pace for five minutes. I thought about my walking technique — engaging my core so my abs were working, keeping my chest open and shoulders down, and swinging my arms as I moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to fartlek walking, or you’re getting back into fitness, it might be a good idea to try the three-minute intervals first and build up to five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-got-a-lot-done-in-30-minutes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I got a lot done in 30 minutes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all working parents will appreciate, I have a lot to juggle, and despite writing about fitness for a living, sometimes it’s my workouts that suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite only being 30 minutes long, I felt like I’d worked hard with this interval walk. I’d raised my heart rate higher than I would typically do on a dog walk, and I’ve found interval walking is a great option for those who want to reap the benefits of walking, without the time to take a longer stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can help improve your overall fitness, build muscle, strengthen your bones and joints, and help boost your mood and lower stress. You’ll also burn more calories doing a fartlek walk than you typically would walking at the same pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking"&gt;walking for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, remember the key is to be in a calorie deficit, burning more calories than you consume. One of the easiest ways to keep an eye on your pace, heart rate, and calorie burn is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-m-still-hooked"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m still hooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was instantly hooked after a week of the Japanese walking method, and I equally enjoyed this fartlek workout. As a runner, I use my walks as a form of active recovery, but this was a great way to work on my cardiovascular endurance, without the impact of running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also helped me de-stress and boost my mood, plus, it gave me the excuse to take a break from my laptop and spend 30 minutes outdoors in nature — something we should all do more of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fitting long workouts into your routine feels overwhelming, this can be done with no equipment, on your lunch break, in your local park or even on the treadmill at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the joy of fartlek is the freedom to play with your pace — if structured intervals feel too much, just walk faster for two blocks, then slower for a block, or use street lights as your markers. However fast or slow you walk, you’re getting fitter and healthier with every step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
