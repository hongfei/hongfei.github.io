The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64209221" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;high numbers of extra deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was," says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;The King's Fund&lt;/a&gt;. "But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the "bottom of the pack of comparable countries," she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Causes and risk factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the "low hanging fruit" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2023" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;latest official figures&lt;/a&gt;. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK," said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for "urgent government action" in its prevention, detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Deaths at younger ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the CMI found "really significant differences" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a "concerning" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group," says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;About the data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:47:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBqS1V5aFFsZ05ER3NMa0lPYnZUNjZFLTUzWkE5RzdUVVRYVGphNU1mMDUyZDI3TnlQY0lCaEdpUlM3b2ttOE1DVDE5NG1FdU5PaUx1WlJ2MjJGUdIBX0FVX3lxTFBhNnk5d0lhcjFNMktBQ1BudFlhQVR5a3Y2ZmZCZGJRcllocktMR0s2blo5bXJDeFl3d1I4LXhlZ0lOc0NQZnNTMjJEbDZJOXlWZ2NfTGxPd3d6STJISWxV</guid></item><item><title>Measles confirmed in unvaccinated Montgomery County child; others may have been exposed - WHYY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9SSnNNeHFXMkNYSHFqSDZtLVllTlV6MVlPU0ZPY2FjQTJ5bjROTVhQekJzamtOQmFFRjhQcTl0Rkl0cXlPeWcyWFNJZnV5T0RXNENIbUVZNnZmOGNZd2FSTVljRF9kbmpkNjE2OVdtWGhZWVR0Y2pOdDRvONIBgAFBVV95cUxQQ29sVzhDUzN5TFgzX2l2cDE3UzU4SE9mOHpEeXV3U3ZWdDA4d2YwSGU0NzVPblFvRGVFb24zNDJ1ZTBOTlBqakE4MkNpNnRRU0NtOTB5T0VyZUFVMk1vdk1ZN2F3OTVJZi1OZTRwUkdYT2Q0aWRpUUhzRWJEVkpPaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="flexible-content-container wysiwyg-styles"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania have confirmed a case of &lt;a href="https://6abc.com/tag/measles/" data-testid="prism-linkbase"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; in a child, and say it’s possible members of the public were exposed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of Public Health said Sunday that the case involved an unvaccinated child who lives in the county. The child’s hometown was not released.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said contact tracing is now underway and people who may have been exposed are being contacted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may have been exposed at the following times and locations:

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, was widely criticized as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title=""&gt;minimizing the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

But on neither occasion did Mr. Kennedy himself advise Americans to make sure their children got the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of H.H.S., did not send its first substantive notice about the outbreak until Thursday, almost a month after the first cases in Texas were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“They’ve been shouting with a whisper,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who is an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota and a former health department official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I fear that their hands have been tied,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;C.D.C. officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Since 2021, the region has faced “an acute upsurge” in cholera, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WH3JJSEDA5F43CQT6VXOUX4EKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Out of 27 African countries participating in the study, just three — Ethiopia, Kenya and Zambia — were on track to meet the region’s goal of eliminating cholera by 2030, the study found. While the region was on track with efforts such as mapping hot spots and setting up surveillance systems, the researchers found, it lags on milestones involving increased funding for cholera control and elimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMGF7HNYP5H5ZFZEEIOKH2GWG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Insufficient water, sanitation and hygiene efforts and fragile health-care systems are to blame, the researchers write — and climate change, war and poverty are making things worse. Overall, the researchers found, the region had progressed by just 53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FANVINFOBZBKLGMTENJKM2UBA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One issue is that some countries treat cholera outbreaks as an emergency instead of investing in long-term infrastructure to combat the disease, the researchers write. The region needs “sustainable and predictable” funding to meet its goals, they note. The researchers called for increased funding to the region, including a possible U.N. cholera fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M3CJ7MZYRJCVRFDQIIAYN5JHRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of the waterborne disease, which can cause fatal diarrhea, continues. Cholera is most prevalent in places that lack sanitation due to poverty, poor infrastructure, war and weak health systems. Though it’s easy to treat and there are vaccines available, outbreaks have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera" target="_blank"&gt;risen&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CKAICIK2MVE6XJCRGXHFZGPGSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-cholera-outbreak--external-situation-report--22---24-january-2025" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the WHO documented more than 800,000 cases of cholera and 5,805 deaths in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCHK2JSGNRFTBJKDLU3MHVNUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-cholera-outbreak--external-situation-report--23--20-february-2025" target="_blank"&gt;most recent data release&lt;/a&gt;, 19 countries nationwide had cholera cases in January, led by South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Africa region and Afghanistan, Yemen and Sudan in the Eastern Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="COKY34CHNBB4JFZ6PCIJ6Z3ZPY" data-apitype="header" level="6" id="COKY34CHNBB4JFZ6PCIJ6Z3ZPY"&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 19:02:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOdHRYX19Ua0NldVphZ2thaHhOWm9kVlc1UEFQdmZTY1FocTR1OU5uNHl4LXRBZVdvSEp2LXJKN0d5MUJ2S2twOUlRc0pPXzVhU1kwZUFKOTZxemhUSE1PWHVidTM1bzFlWFFuOFRJQkY1d182dng3aHRtYVpyQ29CZ1BJSjBlUWdZNk8wejBiTQ</guid></item><item><title>Lifesaving drug successfully lowers cholesterol levels and body weight - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQR3MwNUtJRmdwOTdPa0Q3VWRSZ3RSX2ROYldlLUZnX1hjaFpUckMtN3lhRXRpZTd6YTBkcURNTmxKNDdZalJ0bU1VTmZHYWNmcy1nandwaTQxYzNLdXRfQkJqWmt3QTFkd1g5Q0FzNEJOVWpFRFRXNXE3YU1xRlY3blczd29uRERtaDI2N3ZIZGZDd1hERi15YXJ2N2h6a0pqeHk1dkNoMm5COTcyVXoxXw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100 million Americans struggle with obesity and related metabolic disorders, a staggering number with widespread consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were really excited about this work," says S. Thai Thayumanavan, a biomedical engineer and chemist at the &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;/a&gt;. This technique takes on greater significance when viewed against the broader health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this breakthrough is a tiny yet powerful tool—nanogels. These microscopic carriers hold a synthetic thyroid hormone drug known as a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/dna-based-nanotransporters-revolutionize-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thyromimetic&lt;/a&gt;. While thyroid hormones are vital for liver metabolism, their systemic use often leads to severe side effects, making them an unreliable treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than administering the hormone throughout the body, researchers designed nanogels to deliver it precisely where it's needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A graphic depicting how the drug targets the liver.

"They were custom-designed for hepatocyte delivery in the liver." This precision avoids the harmful effects associated with traditional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Mice given the treatment lost all the excess weight they had gained, with no harmful side effects. "The treated mice completely lost their gained weight, and we did not see any untoward side effects," Thayumanavan reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits went beyond weight loss. Despite remaining on a high-fat diet, the mice showed improved cholesterol levels and significantly reduced &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-first-successful-in-patient-trial-of-liver-dialysis-has-been-completed/"&gt;liver inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers also looked at data from more than 300 men. They then used that information, along with fecal (i.e. poop) samples to learn more about the participants’ gut microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when people had a daily serving of citrus, it lowered their risk of developing depression by about 20 percent. This was unique to citrus—meaning, data didn’t establish the same link with other fruits or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers drilled down even more, they found that the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii)&lt;/em&gt;, which is found in the gut microbiome of people who eat citrus fruits, was more abundant in people who weren't depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These data underscore the role of diet in the prevention of depression, and offer a plausible explanation for how the intestinal microbiome modulates the influence of citrus on mental health,” the researchers wrote in their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does gut bacteria influence your mental health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria in your gut, a.k.a. your gut microbiome, play a “crucial role” in your mental health by influencing the production of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that help cells “talk” to each other), bodily inflammation, and the integrity of your gut barrier, says Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain gut bacteria, like &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt;, contribute to the gut-brain axis, a bi-directional communication system between the gut and the brain,” Keatley says. This particular bacteria is especially important because it can help to reduce inflammation, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since chronic inflammation has been linked to depression, increasing &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; in the gut [by way of consuming citrus] may help regulate mood by reducing inflammatory markers,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, while the gut-brain relationship is firmly established, the way this pathway actually functions on a cellular level is still being explored. “We don’t fully understand the pathways between gut health and depression,” says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thea Gallagher;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thea Gallagher&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, a clinical associate professor at NYU Langone Health and cohost of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Fmind-in-view%2Fid1544156706&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa63975392%2Forange-citrus-depression-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mind in View;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mind in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast. “But we do know there’s something there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many oranges do you have to eat to see benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular study found that eating one medium orange a day could help lower your risk of depression. But the researchers also lumped all citrus together. So, if you’re a grapefruit fan, you can feel good knowing that you’re also doing your mental health a solid by having a daily serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is citrus so special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about citrus that seem to give it extra oomph when it comes to improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real game-changer in citrus is its high concentration of flavonoids, such as naringenin and formononetin,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These flavonoids help support the growth of the essential bacteria &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii, &lt;/em&gt;and also may regulate processes in the gut that help increase the availability of our "feel-good" neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, in the body, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep in mind that the study's findings don't actually &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that consuming citrus influences your mental health—they just establish a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also only looks at one aspect of citrus' impact on the gut, and specifically, the bacterial link, points out &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/gail-m-saltz-md/1095-park-avenue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gail Saltz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citrus may impact the gut biome, but it also has other features, such as high vitamin C, which could figure into this story," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other foods that can lower depression risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between eating a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression, which suggests that eating whole, unprocessed foods may be better for your mental and physical health, Gallagher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher adds that focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods that don’t have a lot of ingredients is the “safe route” when it comes to eating for mental health. But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80/20 style of eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kimchi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:58:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBMSjRLSDRkY1hZdnNNaVM3U0dCM3dKcUNBS041NktmTWtFYkk4S0hudDlMUkdPQlc3d0VpNmpEc3FiejZlOE5qbXFTS3ZYM0VHOWVHREhtc2Vyd1BPd21CRzM1d0s1VXRmZURxamRjWUp1dw</guid></item><item><title>Herpes Wakes Up: Scientists Discover Hidden Trigger for Cold Sore Flare-Ups - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPR2dqVjhiaVNkTklDdjY2UG8yTk1TMWRNT19WRmY5Y01WaHdCMl9aNE9sTHBXYVFCVHY4dC02TEpGX1g0WXZ4Mk9XNU9LSEFqVUhHcDBQMDF2S1MzZ1VwYUpoMTJ1X2VDZVg4NjBSRTFwaV85VVdoUXlIclZJWjdUOW00YjM2UXB1WlA3bEZXekdrbHlBcFNvV3YtSXhLTWNiaHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:30:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPR2dqVjhiaVNkTklDdjY2UG8yTk1TMWRNT19WRmY5Y01WaHdCMl9aNE9sTHBXYVFCVHY4dC02TEpGX1g0WXZ4Mk9XNU9LSEFqVUhHcDBQMDF2S1MzZ1VwYUpoMTJ1X2VDZVg4NjBSRTFwaV85VVdoUXlIclZJWjdUOW00YjM2UXB1WlA3bEZXekdrbHlBcFNvV3YtSXhLTWNiaHc</guid></item><item><title>I’m a Dietitian and This Is My Favorite Healthy High-Protein Granola Bar - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9Wb2tTZWJ6Mk5INmVzZ2lFbmRlMHlaOHJMOC1CMWFWQWRnelBmYm1CREVhRlhVM3lULTc4Zl9RSHpLU0pPaFo5ZUpHRlZPS19zRjlLV0IyOTVneUx3YlhMR0ZPVUlSWFAwTXRybnIzQTVodzlFM284?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Kelli McGrane, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating Well / Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dietitian, I’m all about convenience. After all, so many of us live such fast-paced lives that I always encourage my clients and readers to lean on nutritious foods that don’t require a ton of work to prepare. Granola bars are one great example. You can grab one to eat in the car while you drive to work or throw one in your daily carry bag to munch on if hunger strikes unexpectedly. However, granola bars can be a sneaky source of not-so-healthy things like added sugars and saturated fat. Eating too much saturated fat and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7869775/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-cut-out-sugar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:added sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;—which most Americans do—can lead to health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m sharing my favorite healthy granola bar—Clif Nut Butter Bars. With these bars, you don’t have to sacrifice taste for nutrition. They’re stuffed with satisfying nut butter for a creamy treat full of heart-healthy fats, plant protein and fiber. Plus, they have far less added sugar and saturated fat than many other options out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7829052/breakfast-bars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Better for You Breakfast Bars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 Better for You Breakfast Bars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why I Love Clif Nut Butter Bars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Great Taste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever said that healthy food can’t taste good was wrong. And let’s be real—if something doesn’t taste good, you’re probably not going to want to eat it anyway. One of the main reasons I love these Clif Nut Butter Bars is that they taste so good! They have a similar texture to classic Clif bars, but they’re smaller and they have a creamy nut butter filling. This makes them feel decadent and satisfying in a whole new way. You might even want one after dinner for dessert!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good Source of Plant Protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re reaching for a granola bar for a snack or a quick breakfast, protein is key. It helps you feel full so you’re held over until your next meal or snack. It also helps prevent blood sugar spikes so you can feel a steady rise in energy rather than a big burst and then a dramatic crash. I love that this Clif Nut Butter Bar has 7 grams of protein per serving. It’s all &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; from peanuts and pea protein, making it vegetarian-friendly. Paired with a cup of milk (which has 8 grams of protein), it makes for an excellent high-protein post-workout snack to support muscle growth and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960613/are-peanuts-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Are Peanuts Healthy? Here's What a Dietitian Has to Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Are Peanuts Healthy? Here's What a Dietitian Has to Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contain Heart-Healthy Fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, many granola bars are high in saturated fat—the kind that’s bad for heart health. Compared to other options, Clif Nut Butter Bars are pretty low in saturated fat, with 2.5 grams per bar. For reference, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating no more than 22 grams of saturated fat per day if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these bars especially great, though, is that they’re a good source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy unsaturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because they use real peanut butter and peanuts, which are rich in monounsaturated fat. This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type of fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type of fat&lt;/a&gt; can help lower cholesterol levels to lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. Just like protein, it also helps slow digestion to prevent blood sugar spikes, making this a blood sugar–friendly snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Have a Few Grams of Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key nutrient I look for in granola bars is fiber. Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:don’t eat nearly enough;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;don’t eat nearly enough&lt;/a&gt; of this important carb, and little adjustments can go a long way (like finding a higher-fiber granola bar!). Each Clif Nut Butter Bar has 3 grams of fiber—about 11% of the Daily Value.  There are other bars out there with even more fiber, but they tend to be higher in saturated fat and/or added sugars. I really like the overall nutritional balance of these bars. If you’re looking to add more fiber, pair the bar with a banana or a couple of Medjool dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Relatively Low in Added Sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to other granola bars, Clif Nut Butter Bars are pretty low in added sugars. Each bar has 6 grams. For reference, the Dietary Guidelines recommend eating no more than 50 grams of added sugars per day if you follow a 2,000-calorie diet. Other granola bars can have upward of 12 grams of added sugars. They may also use stevia or artificial sweeteners, which I personally don’t love the taste of. So I love that these bars have a delicious flavor without too many added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-bar-recipes-you-ll-want-to-make-forever-8743366" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 Breakfast Bars You'll Want to Make Forever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;16 Breakfast Bars You'll Want to Make Forever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need a granola bar to grab and go, I recommend Clif Nut Butter Bars. Compared to other granola bars, they have a good balance of fiber, healthy fat and protein, with minimal added sugars and saturated fat. Plus, they’re super tasty! I love having one of these bars as a part of a quick breakfast or an afternoon snack. They’re also great to pair with a glass of milk for a high-protein, post-workout snack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-healthy-high-protein-granola-bar-11686872" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 16:24:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9Wb2tTZWJ6Mk5INmVzZ2lFbmRlMHlaOHJMOC1CMWFWQWRnelBmYm1CREVhRlhVM3lULTc4Zl9RSHpLU0pPaFo5ZUpHRlZPS19zRjlLV0IyOTVneUx3YlhMR0ZPVUlSWFAwTXRybnIzQTVodzlFM284</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu detected in nearby Pa. county - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQQVUyRVlFN3FoM0pyNjZWUnVCVlZOa25mZ0lSd2FqbG9NWTdIMkJjOEVZMEdjYmZCYm9XZWxlMFh2SEtiTS1NUnRuM0tYZF9XdDhRTjk4dzlqMlRjUUJYUVpqblByTnAtVmNfdkhkVDFoWDBkUFZwTmx4eGdmZkpmTHNDUdIBiAFBVV95cUxNOVRra3RhTVFHRjFhOGpTZTNWeWNzWHpSYzVfVGxqMjQyRmlpUm1LWUlSeEswNzdKc1dBTWkxN09YTHNVc0JVcUR2V3dnZXZ5RGo2dVQ5RFl0c1RKakJUNjBQWnQwNEdBTkhtQl9mY1N2Rks5WjFmZW40Z0JfQVp4RWZLMnZZVUJm?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Measles continues its march. And influencers who contributed to this debacle are trying to downplay its seriousness and dodge responsibility for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nationwide in the US there are 164 cases as of Wednesday, with Texas contributing 146 of those.  Expect another disturbing update soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-kids-cases-what-know-rcna194216" target="_blank"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in case you thought America was uniquely idiotic about infectious disease:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australian vaccination rates &lt;/strong&gt;are down to 83%.  And last year they had 57,000 whooping cough cases. This continued in January of this year, with almost 5,000 cases in one month. They also have a few measles cases in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov.au/newsroom/news-and-articles/whooping-cough-still-lingers" target="_blank"&gt;Australian CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has a measles outbreak over 150 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ontario has over 140 measles cases, which is more than the total they have had in the past 10 years &lt;em&gt;combined. &lt;/em&gt;They also have falling vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/measles-cases-ontario-double-last-two-weeks-1.7470166" target="_blank"&gt;Doubled in the past two weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has not used vitamin A at the WHO recommended protocol which does reduce morbidity and mortality in deficient children.  Americans hate to admit they might be deficient in anything at all, but a lot of us are.  In any case, measles actively depletes vitamin A stores, so a large loading dose can be useful in hospitalized children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/infectdis/Fulltext/2020/07000/Vitamin_A_for_the_Management_of_Measles_in_the.2.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;LWW.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New studies on Covid patients in France who were hospitalized show them at higher risk for death and readmission for as much as 2.5 years afterward.  This risk is highest for the first six months.&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/hospitalized-covid-patients-higher-risk-organ-related-death-readmission-25-years-data" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey reports its first H5N1 infections in cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/new-jersey-reports-h5-avian-flu-cluster-cats" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO is recommending that next year’s flu vaccines use a different clade of the H3N2 subtype. This type changes more frequently than most of the other flus. Pandemic preparedness researches also pointed out a strain of H5N1 and one of H5N6 to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/who-advisers-swap-out-h3n2-strains-next-northern-hemisphere-flu-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that 13% of children who died of flu this year had brain damage.  Today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that 13% of children who have died from seasonal flu this season had influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE), a severe neurologic complication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in these cases are four patients who had acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), the most severe form of IAE, which can lead to varying degrees of brain dysfunction, inflammation, and other neurologic problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data has not been consistently gathered so it is not known if this is worse than average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers," the authors wrote. "Health care providers should consider IAE in children with febrile illness and clinically compatible neurologic signs or symptoms, including but not limited to seizures, altered mental status, delirium, decreased level of consciousness, lethargy, hallucinations, or personality changes lasting &amp;gt;24 hours."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although all vegetables bring a level of healthiness to the equation, as well as properties that can help prevent diseases and ailments, not every vegetable can do it all. That's why maintaining a well-rounded, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/978563/tips-to-help-you-move-toward-a-healthier-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy daily diet&lt;/a&gt; full of nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants is necessary not just for feeling good, but for improving your chances for a long life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the vegetables that fits the bill when it comes to preventing some of the leading causes of death in the U.S. is cauliflower. This delicious and versatile veggie contains nutrients that can help stave off cancer, heart disease, and even &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/453921/different-types-of-diabetes-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. "Cauliflower is rich in plant compounds, including phytonutrients that act as antioxidants, helping to protect cells from damage," &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" target="_blank"&gt;Kat Benson&lt;/a&gt;, a Registered Dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, told Health Digest exclusively, adding that these compounds in addition to cauliflower's high fiber content, keep cholesterol and inflammation levels in the healthy range, making it great for heart health. "Cauliflower's fiber and low-carb profile can also help stabilize blood sugar, which is beneficial for diabetes management," said Benson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While those are the major benefits of eating cauliflower, they're also just the tip of the iceberg. It seems cauliflower has even more to offer, so it just might be time to start eating it, if you don't already, or begin to eat it more regularly if it's something that you only sometimes include in your meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to lose weight or maintain a certain weight, cauliflower can help. Not only is it low in calories, containing just 27 calories per cup, but thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/435316/eat-these-foods-if-you-need-more-fiber/" target="_blank"&gt;high fiber count&lt;/a&gt;, cauliflower will make you feel fuller longer, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589116/" target="_blank"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients. "Additionally, regular fiber intake promotes digestive health by supporting regular bowel movements and overall digestive function, contributing to a healthy colon," said Benson. It is also a water-dense vegetable, consisting of 92.1% water. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4848697/" target="_blank"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt;, also published in Nutrients, found that water-dense foods have the ability to aid in weight loss, especially in those who are categorized as obese.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower is also rich in choline, with 44.3 milligrams per cup, as well as sulforaphane. While the former is essential in promoting healthy body functioning, like cell growth and metabolism health, per a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6213596/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients, sulforaphane, which is a specific antioxidant, is potentially effective against cancer in animals. It may also possibly slow &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/1641518/what-are-the-5-warning-signs-of-prostate-cancer/" target="_blank"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; growth, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30652644/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; published in Current Pharmaceutical Design.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's so great about cauliflower is all the ways in which it can be prepared. For example, if you're looking for low-carb options, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/346128/this-is-how-healthy-cauliflower-substitutes-really-are/" target="_blank"&gt;cauliflower is a substitute&lt;/a&gt; that can easily replace the macaroni in mac and cheese and the potatoes in mashed potatoes. It can also be put in a food processor so it can be made into dough for pizza or tortillas. However, if you really love the taste of cauliflower, you're less likely to get the full flavor when it's incorporated this way into recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best way [to eat it] is the way you'll enjoy it," said Benson. "A great way is to pair it with some fat (like olive oil or avocado oil) to help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins, like vitamin K. Roasted with other veggies, seasoned with salt and pepper, is always a simple, delicious option." How you choose to include more cauliflower into your diet is your call. So let yourself get creative and finally realize that, wow, &lt;a href="https://www.healthdigest.com/382239/cauliflower-grits-recipe/" target="_blank"&gt;cauliflower grits&lt;/a&gt; are so delicious, so how the heck did you live so long without them? Paired with some fruit and an egg for protein, and you've got yourself a healthy way to start your day.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/article&gt;

As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01360-5" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, the team found that their technique generated sufficient protein to protect the mice's DNA from radiation-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same method, they hope, could eventually be used in human cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Radiation can be very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects can be limiting," MIT associate professor of mechanical engineering Giovanni Traverso in a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/tiny-tardigrades-protein-may-help-cancer-patients-tolerate-radiation-therapy-0226" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "There’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side effects of radiation treatment can be brutal, from mouth sores to rectal bleeding. Scientists have come up with drugs that reduce this damage, but only to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In search for a better option, the researchers drew inspiration from tardigrades and their incredible survival ability. A suppressor protein, dubbed Dsup, helps to protect the tardigrades' DNA from radiation-induced damage by binding to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to MIT, this protein allows the tiny creatures to survive doses 2,000 to 3,000 times higher than what humans can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By delivering this protein through messenger RNA encoding, the team found that the Dsup protein was expressed successfully in the colon and mouth tissues in mice, two areas that are susceptible to radiation-induced damage in human cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it’s considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells’ genome," Kirtane explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping cancer patients during radiation therapy, the researchers suggest it could also help patients receiving chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could even help astronauts from suffering radiation damage, since long voyages through space, such as a trip to Mars, would &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mars-astronauts-radiation-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;expose future space travelers to dangerous levels&lt;/a&gt; of cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Another possible application would be to help prevent radiation damage in astronauts in space," MIT enthused in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on tardigrades:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientists-tardigrades-star-systems" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Scientists Propose Sending Small Creatures to Neighboring Star Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 14:00:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNR1JTVG5GdjNOZDBaeFpUNTBNMkxxby1HbFVBVmZ5ZF9MRTJIeGNVY01rZlhxb21qbjNhVGF4N0Rta1U5ZW9uLWpXd2JISThxUV9WYWgyMU1lTHlmNkdWb3p6OWg0R1RjczBoQjJZVWRYZUFqZURFLTYwYm82bkFaX1hxdDVza2E0UVQw</guid></item><item><title>How much has bird flu spread in WA? - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOWHRVYm5xZElLMHQ4bnRoX21mRXZMV005VUE4Qmt5UmFoUWNxWkYwN1A1Tk5fdjlFUENmSHRsQTdYLVYzMG00TWZtR3J1UHR5QVRWby11VnlCNWVLbjBjNVBsQ2NIUEFhUTdkQklTNXJUQVo0Rm5tQV9uajdaZmZYaE53?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOWHRVYm5xZElLMHQ4bnRoX21mRXZMV005VUE4Qmt5UmFoUWNxWkYwN1A1Tk5fdjlFUENmSHRsQTdYLVYzMG00TWZtR3J1UHR5QVRWby11VnlCNWVLbjBjNVBsQ2NIUEFhUTdkQklTNXJUQVo0Rm5tQV9uajdaZmZYaE53?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How much has bird flu spread in WA?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSnoxaVBGS0VPS2NhY0hwejdFWE5Zb1hya0FXVTNBa1FNZ1A5c3ZaU0VoV0REaHdiaVNoVFFPY3dIOXB3UjdIUU03UnZsLVVJREhvc21zMV80WmVCZlpqQl9PeHVRemw3Q2ZsZlpuYjJ2SnVXQmhCbkU3NnhOdmFHdTY1TEJiRkhj?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What Does the Avian Flu Surge Mean for Your Bird Feeders?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;National Audubon Society&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNOERUdk9GMmxYN2pRSVJ1MFBobDVxVmhGVnpsR2FaaXZQOGlMQWdBb09NVG4tRE1iMm5kZVJieV9GUGJJOHRaM1ZXNlpDUWZmT1EyVkpWdkpFODFnNC1FeWN5T200SWowZ19UYUx2dnhINzZvWFV4bThWUU1ON0FZYUpkczcxd1ZTamFLclB5Q04?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;FAQ: What to know about bird flu in WA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPbDUxYXlWUWpfSVJZdTdzd1QxdzBwRGpIdDh1V095eVJTZFhIQ0ZfTW4zN0l0a3NyclJURWU0N1BFQklfOUYyMHhqZmxOMTVmVUJ6RU00M2lSUWxGSkNtNkxjQlhmMGxVNURzaHhhal9SUEVfRzNnZHZvQ2RHVndJV3NjNWUxeUVtTHFtZUZn?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;CDC Reports New Bird Flu Cases In Humans.

Researchers discovered that both a person’s genetic predisposition for ADHD and experiences of childhood maltreatment independently increase the likelihood of experiencing ADHD symptoms in adulthood. Furthermore, the study suggests that genetic factors that raise the risk of ADHD may also indirectly increase the risk of a child experiencing maltreatment. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02589-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a condition that affects both children and adults, making it difficult to concentrate, control impulsive behaviors, and manage hyperactivity. It is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, meaning it stems from differences in brain development. People with ADHD may struggle with organization, following instructions, and sitting still. While ADHD often starts in childhood, for many individuals, the symptoms continue into adulthood, impacting their work, relationships, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that ADHD has a strong genetic component, meaning it tends to run in families. However, environmental factors, particularly negative childhood experiences, are also thought to play a significant role. Childhood maltreatment, which includes physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect, is a serious global problem with wide-ranging negative consequences for a child’s development and later life. Previous research has shown a connection between childhood maltreatment and an increased risk of developing ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain a deeper understanding of this connection, researchers in Brazil decided to investigate how genetic predisposition and childhood maltreatment might interact to influence ADHD symptoms in adulthood. They wanted to explore if genes and environment act independently, or if they influence each other in complex ways. Specifically, they looked at two possibilities: gene-environment interaction and gene-environment correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene-environment interaction would mean that the effect of genes on ADHD risk is different depending on whether someone has experienced maltreatment or not. Gene-environment correlation suggests that genes may influence the environment a person experiences. This study is particularly important because most previous research in this area has been conducted in high-income countries, while the rates of childhood maltreatment are often higher in low- and middle-income countries like Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from a long-term study that has been following a group of individuals born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, in 2004. This study, known as the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort, initially included nearly all babies born in the city that year. The participants have been examined at various ages throughout their lives. For this particular study, the researchers focused on data collected when the participants were 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 18, the young adults completed a self-report questionnaire called the Adult Self Report Scale for ADHD. This questionnaire asks about symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are typical of ADHD. Mothers or caregivers also completed a questionnaire called the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, reporting on their child’s behavior, including hyperactivity and inattention. Using both self-reports and reports from mothers provided a more comprehensive picture of ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess genetic predisposition for ADHD, the researchers used genetic information collected from saliva samples taken when the participants were 6 years old. They calculated an ADHD genetic score for each participant. This score, called a polygenic score, is based on the combined effect of many common genetic variations across the entire genome that have been linked to ADHD in large previous studies. A higher score indicates a greater genetic likelihood of developing ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood maltreatment was evaluated using the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale. This questionnaire was administered to mothers or caregivers when the children were 6 and 11 years old. It asks about parenting behaviors that could be considered physical and psychological maltreatment, such as yelling, shaking, or hitting a child. The researchers used the average maltreatment score from ages 6 and 11 to represent overall childhood maltreatment experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After gathering all this data, the researchers used statistical methods to analyze the relationships between genetic scores, childhood maltreatment, and ADHD symptoms at age 18. They considered various factors that could influence ADHD, such as sex, skin color, birth weight, intelligence quotient, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal education, family income, household size, and maternal depression, to ensure their findings were not due to these other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed several important findings. First, the researchers confirmed that the ADHD genetic score was associated with ADHD symptoms in adulthood, as reported by both the young adults themselves and their mothers. This means that individuals with higher genetic scores were more likely to show ADHD symptoms at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they found that childhood maltreatment was also linked to ADHD symptoms in adulthood. Individuals who experienced more maltreatment in childhood, according to reports from their mothers or caregivers, were more likely to report ADHD symptoms themselves and were also rated as having more symptoms by their mothers at age 18. This was true for both overall maltreatment and specifically for psychological and physical aggression, including corporal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, and interestingly, the study found that the ADHD genetic score was also associated with childhood maltreatment scores. This suggests that children with a higher genetic predisposition for ADHD were more likely to experience maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the researchers conducted additional analyses to investigate the mechanism behind this link. They found that ADHD symptoms observed at age 6 appeared to act as a mediator between genetic predisposition and later maltreatment. In other words, children with a higher genetic risk for ADHD might exhibit more ADHD symptoms early in life, and these early symptoms might, in turn, increase the likelihood of experiencing maltreatment. This suggests what is known as an evocative gene-environment correlation, where a child’s genetic traits influence how others, like parents, behave towards them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study did not find evidence for gene-environment interaction. This means that the effect of genetic predisposition on ADHD symptoms was not significantly different for those who experienced maltreatment compared to those who did not. Genes and environment appeared to have independent effects on ADHD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged some limitations of their study. Although the Pelotas birth cohort is a valuable resource, some participants were lost to follow-up over time, which could introduce some bias. The measurement of maltreatment relied on reports from mothers or caregivers and only captured maltreatment at ages 6 and 11, potentially missing maltreatment at other times or reported by other individuals. Also, for ethical reasons, the study did not specifically investigate more severe forms of maltreatment, such as sexual abuse. Furthermore, genetic scores developed primarily in European populations may not be as accurate in predicting ADHD risk in diverse populations like those in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has several strengths, including its long-term prospective design, the use of validated questionnaires, and the inclusion of both self and mother reports of ADHD symptoms. The fact that the study was conducted in a middle-income country like Brazil, where rates of childhood adversity can be high, adds to the importance of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02589-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gene – maltreatment interplay in adult ADHD symptoms: main role of a gene–environment correlation effect in a Brazilian population longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Luciana Tovo-Rodrigues, Laísa Camerini, Thais Martins-Silva, Marina Xavier Carpena, Carolina Bonilla, Isabel Oliveira Oliveira, Cristiane Silvestre de Paula, Joseph Murray, Aluísio J.

Just like that, my husband and I found ourselves in a world that suddenly felt like it had been designed by someone with a really dark sense of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For months, Elissa had felt abdominal pain and bloating, especially on her left side, she told those gathered near the Detroit River that September day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa recalled the fear that threatened to consume her as her doctor explained the culprit was not ovarian cancer but colorectal cancer, which had spread to her ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I started to panic. ‘How far (had it spread)?’ was my first question,” Elissa said. “She didn't know. … The next thing I said was, ‘but I have a 6-year-old.' ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In that single vulnerable moment, Elissa came to realize what so many already know firsthand: Cancer is cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It doesn’t care that you’re only 37 years old, that you're the mother of a little girl who is your entire world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When the only certainty was uncertainty, Elissa vowed to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She chose to accept nothing less than surviving long enough to ensure Harper would remember her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Long enough to throw a lifetime’s worth of softballs to the little girl with her same wavy, golden hair, long arms and legs, and broad smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Long enough to jump herself breathless with Harper’s hands in hers on the trampoline of their Macomb Township home and to take many more Mother’s Day trips to Longboat Key, Florida, with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Long enough, she prays, to one day help her little girl shop for a prom dress and be there when Harper tosses her cap at college graduation, walks down the aisle and holds her first child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It will never be enough,” Elissa said. “I think all the time, is she old enough now that she’ll remember me?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The price has been steep for even the three years and 10 months since that unforgettable day at the gynecologist’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa learned in the weeks that followed that her colon cancer was stage 4 and had spread to her liver and ovaries. Now there are about seven cancerous nodules on her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She has endured 67 chemotherapy infusions that have brought relentless exhaustion along with waves of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. She underwent surgery that removed 60% of her liver, 25% of her colon, her ovaries and her gallbladder. At times, her hair falls out in clumps and her skin peels. She also has had neuropathy in her fingers and feet and cold sensitivity so intense, she sometimes can’t even reach into the refrigerator for a snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80486275007-elissa-chemo-041124-07-mw.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80486275007-elissa-chemo-041124-07-mw.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="University of Michigan registered nurse Taylor Bitz sets up chemotherapy infusion for Elissa Robinson, 40, of Macomb Township, at the University of Michigan’s Rogel Cancer Center in Ann Arbor on Thursday, April 11, 2024."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="University of Michigan registered nurse Taylor Bitz sets up chemotherapy infusion for Elissa Robinson, 40, of Macomb Township, at the University of Michigan’s Rogel Cancer Center in Ann Arbor on Thursday, April 11, 2024." data-c-credit="Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I'm practically a jigsaw puzzle at this point, but I am still here, still standing, still fighting,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She and her husband, Russell Robinson, have been dogged in searching for the top surgeons, leaders in interventional radiology, oncology and colon cancer research — innovators in treatments who might give Elissa an edge over a disease that is expected to take the lives of&lt;a href="https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/types/colorectum" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; 53,000 Americans this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“In her journey, all along, one of my roles has been to help identify the best possible people out there, whoever they are, wherever they are,” Russell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s how Elissa became among the first five people in Michigan outside of clinical trials and among the first 15 nationally to undergo a revolutionary new treatment pioneered at the University of Michigan called histotripsy, which uses ultrasound waves to target cancerous tumors in the liver. It essentially liquefies them without so much as a needle poke or incision, without burning any tissue, without radiation or chemo. There’s almost no pain or recovery time with histotripsy, and it is far less risky than other interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was worth trying with the hope that it might give Elissa another year, another month, another week, another hour to spend not only with Harper, but with Russell, who holds the family together even as pieces of the facade crack and threaten to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/27/PDTF/80692611007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-15-mw.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/27/PDTF/80692611007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-15-mw.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Russell Robinson, of Macomb Township, checks out the bracelets his daughter Harper, 9, has chosen to wear for school on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Russell Robinson, of Macomb Township, checks out the bracelets his daughter Harper, 9, has chosen to wear for school on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024." data-c-credit="Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was worth it to potentially buy more time with her parents, Betty and Sam Saputo, who already lost a child far too soon. Elissa’s only sibling, Nick Saputo, whose nickname, “Nicho,” is tattooed on the inside of her left wrist, died in 2010 in a car accident at the age of 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She still chokes up when she talks about him, knowing her parents will be childless if cancer takes her life, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;So she fights every single day — even as she continues her work as a web editor at the Detroit Free Press, where she’s often the person her co-workers rely on when news breaks to optimize and post stories on Freep.com, to come up with masterful headlines and catch spelling and grammatical mistakes. She writes stories, too, including creative historical lookbacks and photo galleries that often are among the site’s top-viewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Work, she said, “puts my mind on something else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It keeps her busy. It keeps her from stewing about the cancer. She said she’ll keep at it as long as she physically is able.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I think about my life expectancy several times a day,” Elissa wrote in a June 2023 Facebook post. “It's easy to find that dark hole and climb in. Thoughts of the future and my place in it sit in my brain 24/7. But with laughs, family and memories and quite honestly, work, to keep me busy, I can also put the ugly stuff away and enjoy the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80487230007-245818053-10220652381845420-2204611627369409650-n.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80487230007-245818053-10220652381845420-2204611627369409650-n.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson, and her mom, Betty Saputo, sightsee in New York City days before Robinson's scheduled surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering in October 2021."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elissa Robinson, and her mom, Betty Saputo, sightsee in New York City days before Robinson's scheduled surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering in October 2021." data-c-credit="Elissa Robinson, Detroit Free Press"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Those moments include donning Honolulu blue and rooting for the Detroit Lions at Ford Field with her dad, taking Harper to see a Taylor Swift tribute band and making friendship bracelets with her, catching a Broadway play in New York with her mom before a doctor’s appointment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and date nights with Russell, seeing a comedy show, a movie or a concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Through it all, Elissa has been incredibly open about her victories and her struggles with cancer, sharing her story at an event for Gilda’s Club Detroit, on local TV news programs and by posting on Facebook, always ending with the line: “Check your colon” to encourage other people to get colonoscopy screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every year since her diagnosis, Elissa has walked 3.1 miles in the&lt;a href="https://impact.ccalliance.org/event/2024-detroit-walk-to-end-colon-cancer/e551397" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; Detroit Walk to End Colon Cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

The action, called acoustic cavitation, would liquefy the tissue around the air bubbles, allowing doctors to use those concentrated, controlled soundwaves like an incision-free knife.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“That was the inspiration of inventing histotripsy,” Xu said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The idea was seen as an impossibility, Xu said, because scientists hadn’t yet figured out a way to precisely target a treatment area to control the process of cavitation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“At the time, commercial devices were not capable of doing that,” Xu said. “So by inventing histotripsy, our group also had to not only come up with the specialized ultrasound pulse sequence, but we also had to reinvent the whole device so it could be specialized for histotripsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We use microseconds of ultrasound pulse at a pressure level or amplitude that is 10 to 100 times of what is used for imaging — so it’s really high. Nobody had ever tried that before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;In the beginning, the work wasn't glamorous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Xu recalls weekly trips to a slaughterhouse in Milan, where she said she begged for permission to rifle through the trash to retrieve discarded pig hearts for use in her research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I literally would go every week, and back then, they just threw the hearts in a trash can,” she said. “So I just had to do some digging in the trash can to get the hearts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She tried repeatedly testing the theory at a lab in Ann Arbor, using standard commercial ultrasound transducers and probes, but didn’t get the effect she’d hoped to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“They didn’t work,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, Xu didn’t give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We had this huge amplifier that nobody was using.

The bad news is I destroyed the transducer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“At the time, it was a really expensive machine, and I was just in my first year and I was a little worried about that because … I wouldn't be able to afford to replace it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Rather than chastise her, Cain encouraged her to continue to refine it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We put our heads together and said, ‘If we really want to pursue this, we have to build our own instrumentation because the commercial systems are not designed to produce super high pressure within microseconds.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They named the phenomenon histotripsy, which is pronounced like this: HISS-toh-trip-see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Charles Cain is the one who came up with the name because he was trying to parallel it with lithotripsy,” Xu said. “Tripsy means mechanical breakdown in Greek. Litho actually means stone. So lithotripsy is the breakdown of stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Histo means soft tissue in Greek,” Xu said, “So histotripsy is the breakdown of soft tissues, even though it’s a tongue twister.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Xu and Cain knew “we were onto something really, really important,” but convincing the rest of the scientific world that what they’d just discovered was real took a lot of time and effort, Xu said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“For the first 10 years of my career — after I discovered the phenomenon — nobody believed me,” she said. “I kept presenting data, and it's consistent data, but people just don't think you can control cavitation in a predictable way for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It took another 10 years to work on the mechanism and to understand what was happening and to come up with instrumentation. It was a long road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Something borrowed, something blue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Xu worked to develop a technology that could revolutionize surgical care for people with advanced-stage cancer, Elissa graduated from L’Anse Creuse High School in Harrison Township and went on to study journalism and electronic media at Eastern Michigan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She interned at WDIV-TV (Channel 4), and later landed a job as a news producer at the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It seemed as if life was coming together the way it should. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She and Russell were engaged in 2008 and her career was taking off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Then came 2010, a pivotal year for Elissa and for Xu — in ways both good and bad.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In April, Elissa mourned the sudden death of her brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was Easter Sunday when she and her parents left the hospital with a hollow feeling that could never be filled without their Nick — the strong, gregarious, musically gifted young man who could always coax a smile from Elissa and make her laugh.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80489334007-467420079-10110677384812344-3881530832183203667-n.jpg?width=525&amp;amp;height=431&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson and her brother Nick."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elissa Robinson and her brother Nick." data-c-credit="Provided By Elissa Robinson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I sometimes stop to think, if he were here, would he be beside me today?” she wrote in a Facebook post from her bed on the day after Thanksgiving 2024 at the Rogel Cancer Center at U-M as chemotherapy drugs were pumped into her body. “Maybe (he would be) part of the village that helps watch Harper while we're in Ann Arbor? I know he'd be there to push me. But he's still making me stronger. … This road isn't easy. My mind constantly races. … But I'll keep celebrating the wins and living the moments I've been given.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One of those moments took place just three months after Nick’s death, when Elissa and Russell were married in Kauai, Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nick was supposed to be there, celebrating with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“His plane tickets were bought,” she said. “His girlfriend was in my wedding party. We struggled with whether to go forward with it, but we agreed that he wouldn’t want us to put it off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In keeping with the tradition of the bride wearing something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue, Elissa slipped an opal ring onto her pinky. Her father gave that ring to Betty when they started dating years earlier. It represented her something old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa's earrings were new, and she borrowed a tiara from her cousin Jill Saputo, who, unbeknownst to them at the time, would be diagnosed with colon cancer six years later; she died from the disease in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa also wore an ankle bracelet made by her aunt, Gina Rogers. That was her something blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80488866007-467658860-10110691499286824-8649540053963508222-n.jpg?width=720&amp;amp;height=540&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Russell and Elissa Robinson pose for a photo at their wedding in Hawaii on June 28, 2010."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Russell and Elissa Robinson pose for a photo at their wedding in Hawaii on June 28, 2010." data-c-credit="Provided By Elissa Robinson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Elissa and Russell said their vows, Xu and Cain were working to build HistoSonics, the company they’d formed in 2009 with Tim Hall, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and J. Brian Fowlkes, a professor of radiology and biomedical engineering at U-M. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Their company created the Edison System, a device with a robotic arm that delivers precision histotripsy treatments using a specialized, high-powered ultrasound transducer through a tub of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although Xu’s experiments began in a quest to develop a tool for pediatric cardiovascular surgery, her efforts eventually shifted toward targeting tumors in soft tissue, especially those that couldn’t be surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Instead of having to cut open the patient, now they just outline where they want to treat on the image,” Xu said. “Then, there is software they can use to plan out for the robot arm to scan through that volume the path created for treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The sound waves then travel through the body to the target zone, and blast away the tumor without damaging surrounding tissue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“After treatment, the debris is absorbed by the body,” Xu said. “You see that the tumor has completely resolved and there’s like a 1-millimeter scar and that’s all that’s left. It’s almost like a surgeon went in and carved out the tumor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As they tested the effects of histotripsy in mice, Xu and her team discovered a surprising phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If they treated one liver tumor but left another tumor untreated in the mouse, the second tumor would shrink or disappear altogether — as if destroying one mass with histotripsy triggered the immune system to attack cancer elsewhere on a cellular level — something called an abscopal response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We said, ‘What is going on? The tumors were in two different lobes. They were not even in the same lobe,’ ” Xu said. “They were pretty distant. What we found out is that histotripsy … actually stimulates T-cells and other immune cells, too, not only locally, but also systemically — in other places in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Xu described another experiment in rats with highly aggressive liver cancer. Scientists deliberately treated just 50% to 70% of a tumor with histotripsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was to test what would happen if a clinician mistargeted and didn’t treat the entire tumor,” Xu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One month after treatment, “the tumor was gone — even though we only treated 50% to 70% of the mass. It seems to stimulate more immune response than radiation or thermal ablation,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Xu began to imagine what this might mean for people with cancer if histotripsy activates the human immune system in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“With a lot of cancers, people don’t get diagnosed until it’s at a really late stage. So, the body’s immune system doesn’t attack it because it doesn’t even know the cancer is there. It hides behind the cell membrane ... and the body doesn’t even know the invader is there. It can’t even start the first step of attacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Histotripsy disrupts the cell membrane, releasing tumor antigens that alert the body to a foreign invader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"So the body's reaction is: 'Something is invading. I need to check what's invading.' Then, a cascade of immune response can be triggered. ... But you also caused cell death with histotripsy. It is not natural within the body. And the body's first reaction to any unnatural cell death is to start a defense mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Eight people were enrolled in the first human clinical trial of histotripsy in 2019 in Barcelona, Spain. One person had primary liver cancer. The others had cancer that originated in the breast, gallbladder, colon or rectum that had metastasized to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In two of the patients, other tumors that hadn’t been treated with histotripsy also began to shrink eight weeks after the initial mass was treated. Researchers noted that there was a reduction in patients’ tumor markers, too. Xu and her colleagues published &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02656736.2021.1905189#d1e441" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their findings in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, showing what might have been the first evidence of an abscopal response in humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Xu and her colleagues would need far more evidence than just two people in a trial that enrolled a total of eight, so that research remains ongoing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found that histotripsy is a safe and effective treatment for liver tumors — both primary liver cancer and cancers that originated elsewhere, but metastasized to the liver. In the fall of 2023, it authorized HistoSonic’s Edison device as a noninvasive ablation treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In late December of that year, the first patients outside of clinical trials would undergo histotripsy treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Just when she thought it was over, Elissa's fight begins anew&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Robinsons dared to dream about what histotripsy might do for Elissa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nothing about the first three years of her treatments had been as simple — or filled with as much possibility — as histotripsy promised to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the fall of 2021, surgeons at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) in New York City removed more than half of Elissa’s liver in a massive surgery that also took her sigmoid colon, gallbladder and ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She spent weeks in New York recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80490208007-261025629-10108368932988304-2311699566654609981-n.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=391&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80490208007-261025629-10108368932988304-2311699566654609981-n.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=782&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, the surgeon who removed 60% of Robinson's liver weeks earlier at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) in New York City in November, 2021."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elissa Robinson with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, the surgeon who removed 60% of Robinson's liver weeks earlier at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) in New York City in November, 2021." data-c-credit="Provided By Elissa Robinson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In true Elissa-like comedic fashion, she wore a blue T-shirt with the words “Chopped Liver” on the front to a follow-up appointment on Nov. 3, 2021, with her New York medical team.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That day, she was declared cancer-free — an enormous win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“My cancer journey may not be over quite yet, but it sure feels like the beginning of the end ... and that feels amazing,” she wrote at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She also underwent several rounds of postsurgical chemotherapy in Michigan to try to kill off any remaining cancer cells floating around in her body, and got CT scans every three months afterward to monitor for changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately, her cancer-free status didn’t last long. In early 2022, doctors spotted liver tumors once again on one of Elissa’s surveillance CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“To say I'm heartbroken is an understatement,” she wrote. “My thoughts went from ‘this could all be over’ to ... this fight is just beginning. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Another summer of chemo and all the harsh side effects it comes with brings tears to my eyes. I'm angry at my body. I'm scared for the future. I just want to hug my family and never let go. To stare into my daughter's eyes and tell her over and over just how much I love her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“This isn't fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I find myself begging God, on repeat: Heal me. I'm holding onto the faith that He will. I just need to keep doing my part. I'll get there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors changed Elissa’s chemotherapy regimen, and she had thermal ablations to zap those tumors in March 2022 and again in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Robinsons have a high-deductible preferred provider organization (PPO) health insurance plan through Russell's work as an education consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Each January brings a mountain of new medical bills as the health plan's deductible resets. The Robinsons have money withdrawn from their paychecks that goes into a Health Savings Account to help shoulder some of the cost. They set up payment plans for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A GoFundMe account helped pay for Elissa's initial travel expenses in New York, but that money is gone now, and the Robinsons pay out of pocket for the airfare and the hotel rooms and the other expenses every time Elissa has to go back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are wracking up credit card bills for travel to New York," Russell said. "Every time she's gone to New York, no one's paying for that. No one pays $300 a night to get put up in a hotel. ... There are a lot of expenses that we have incurred."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though finding a way to finance it all can be a struggle, Russell says he knows they are fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It is a blessing to have employer-sponsored health coverage ... to have insurance that covers care in that particular state," he said. "That's huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Despite all their efforts to treat the cancerous masses in Elissa's liver, one tumor just wouldn’t go away. By early 2024, two additional spots had sprung up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She and her family hoped histotripsy could be the answer to their prayers — and not only destroy those tumors, but perhaps also even trigger her immune system to attack the small nodules in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, they knew it wouldn’t likely be able to vanquish the fear that accompanies life with stage 4 cancer. It’s a life lived in increments between chemo, surgeries and imaging scans as they try to overcome the anxiety of what the next set of tests might show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Because even when treatments seem to be working, even when there is no evidence of advancing disease, even when Elissa feels pretty well, all things considered, it’s impossible to escape the knowledge that the cancer is there, lurking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What else is there that we can’t see?” she asked, as if to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A birthday celebration and new hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa’s 40th birthday was just six days before her first histotripsy treatment in late February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Betty arranged for friends and family to send her an avalanche of birthday cards, which Elissa set up in a colorful display on a table at their house — a visible show of the love and support all around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She snuggled with Harper, then 9, the night before the procedure, and they said their bedtime prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We've been very open with her from the very beginning about my situation, but we don't really stress the gravity of my health concerns to her,” Elissa said. “She knows that I've been sick, and she knows that I go to chemo every two weeks. She knows that I really wanted this procedure. She knows that I advocated for myself to get this procedure … and it took us a while to get here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“But we say prayers together every night about it. So I'll say my prayer, and then she'll say her prayer, and you know, she'll always say that she prays mommy's chemo is working, and that her procedure goes well, things like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the morning of the procedure, Harper wore one of her homemade friendship bracelets with blue-and-white beads and letters spelling out the name of one of her favorite Taylor Swift albums, which also happened to be an apt description for her mother: “Fearless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80493397007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-06-mw.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80493397007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-06-mw.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson, 40, of Macomb Township, left, wakes her daughter Harper, 9, to get her ready for school on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024.

Since histotripsy uses ultrasound, if bones cover the treatment zone, they can obstruct the path of the sound waves used in the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Still, Mendiratta-Lala said she would try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was what the doctor didn’t say that was most hopeful to Russell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“She said, if she can only get two out of the three … come back in a month, after your scan, and if it's still there, we'll take care of it,” Russell said. “It seemed like she had some knowledge to suggest that it was a very real possibility that that whole process with the immune system could work” to attack that tumor beneath Elissa’s rib cage even if it went untreated with histotripsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Three attempts at histotripsy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A few hours later, Elissa wore a baby blue surgical gown and cap along with royal blue hospital-issued socks with the skid-proof treads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She was placed under anesthesia and intubated — not because the histotripsy procedure itself is painful but because she would have to remain perfectly still to ensure the ultrasound probe delivered the intense acoustic cavitation to the targeted tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The medical team went to work, positioning Elissa’s body to give them the best angle to treat the first targeted tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A wide sheet of white mesh went over Elissa's abdomen. On top of that, the medical team added a clear, soft tub made of a gelatinous material. The tub was filled with water treated to remove any trapped air bubbles — a process called degassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mendiratta-Lala placed her hand inside the water-filled tub and guided the histotripsy transducer across Elissa’s abdomen.

Each time a pulse of acoustic waves zapped a lesion, lines danced across the blue and black screen — showing the ultrasound energy destroying the mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two of Elissa’s tumors were obliterated that day, but the third was too difficult to reach without repositioning Elissa’s body in a way that would have taken too much time under anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;So the doctor told Elissa and Russell they’d try again a few months later — if she still needed the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One month after her initial histotripsy procedure, an MRI showed the tumors that were initially treated with histotripsy had disappeared, leaving behind nothing but tiny internal scars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, the third liver tumor, tucked behind her ribs, was still there. It hadn’t shrunk or gone away as part of her immune system’s response to histotripsy as Elissa and Russell had hoped it would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mendiratta-Lala made another attempt in May to get to it, collapsing one lung under anesthesia to create space for Elissa’s liver to shift.

She felt a bit sore, like she’d done a few too many sit-ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I told her, ‘Well, hell, if you have to have histotripsy every 12 months to take away two or three liver spots, and you're living for another 50 years, that’s OK,’ ” Russell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What if this becomes revolutionary in cancer care, and you’re at the forefront of this and then you can tell the story from the beginning?” he asked. “Just think about how much people clamor for research and changes and hope in cancer care.

Results from the MRI hadn’t popped into her electronic patient portal as quickly as normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ordinarily, she and Russell would read the report at home, trying to gauge what the medical terminology means so they can mentally prepare for her doctor’s appointment and consider what questions they’d like to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This time, they were going in relatively blind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The imaging report from a CT scan the previous week suggested things were stable. But the MRI, they knew, would give a much clearer picture of what the cancer was doing inside her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa led the way to the second floor of the cancer center, hauling her trademark case of donated Girl Scout cookies with her.

What was it they didn’t want her to know, she wondered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sitting in the waiting room, Elissa’s fingers ran over the blue-and-white beaded “Fearless” bracelet Harper had made for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She and Russell held out hope that it was simply a technology glitch that caused the delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perhaps Dr. Christine Veenstra would tell them the MRI confirmed her histotripsy treatments had successfully destroyed all three cancerous tumors in her liver, clearing the way for a break from chemotherapy and a chance to treat the last of her metastases, the ones in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It would be her best chance of getting to the place where everyone saddled with a cancer diagnosis longs to be — cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Here’s what they heard instead: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although Elissa’s histotripsy treatments were successful in blasting her liver tumors, one of them had stubbornly returned in just a few weeks and was growing again. Worse, two new tumors had developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We've got new spots coming up, and that's a sign that we systemically don’t have control of the cancer anymore,” Veenstra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Russell tried to console Elissa and somehow managed to keep himself composed, holding up both of them through the disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There would be no break from chemotherapy for the summer. The what-ifs racing through Elissa’s mind were almost visible on her face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s not what we were hoping for,” she said, her voice cracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tears spilled down her cheeks and she leaned into her husband under the cold fluorescent lights on another blue-sky day that was far too sunny when the news was so grim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80560945007-img-1675-2.jpeg?crop=1195,867,x-1,y30&amp;amp;width=980&amp;amp;height=712&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson, then 40, of Macomb Township, reacts to the news that her colon cancer is no longer responding to chemotherapy treatments as her husband, Russell Robinson, asks questions of her oncologist at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center on June 27, 2024, in Ann Arbor, Michigan."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elissa Robinson, then 40, of Macomb Township, reacts to the news that her colon cancer is no longer responding to chemotherapy treatments as her husband, Russell Robinson, asks questions of her oncologist at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center on June 27, 2024, in Ann Arbor, Michigan." data-c-credit="Kristen Jordan Shamus, Detroit Free Press"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I am concerned enough that I really think it's just time to switch the chemo,” Veenstra said. “We've been on this a long time, and I think we just need to try something different. … We've gotten all the mileage out of FOLFIRI as we can for now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For more than two years, infusions of FOLFIRI, a combination of several drugs — folinic acid, also known as leucovorin, along with calcium folinate, fluorouracil, known as 5FU, and irinotecan — had somewhat controlled Elissa’s cancer growth. It was combined with a monoclonal antibody called Avastin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The drug cocktail is so toxic, Elissa is given a biohazard cleanup kit to take home with her in case the medicine that remains in the rubber bulb connected to the port in her chest leaks as it flows into her body for two days after each in-hospital infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Veenstra suggested trying a different treatment, called FOLFOX, which is the same blend of cancer-fighting drugs as FOLFIRI, but without irenotecan. Instead, Oxaliplatin is added to the cocktail. It's a platinum-based chemotherapy that damages the DNA of cancer cells so they can’t replicate. A monoclonal antibody treatment called cetuximab also was added to the mix. The new concoction was to be delivered via twice-monthly infusions — though each treatment would take longer, pushing the medicine into Elissa’s body for eight or nine hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa was scheduled for more imaging tests in late August to see whether the tumors responded to the new therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Beyond FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, there are few other effective infusion-based chemotherapy options for Elissa's type of cancer. A few oral treatments have been approved by the FDA, but Elissa acknowledged they generally have a lower success rate and are typically used only after the infusion-based therapies fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It scares me that we have to switch chemo because there's so few options,” Elissa said, tears flowing freely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She had planned to finish her work shift remotely after her appointment with Veenstra that day, balancing her laptop on her legs in a bed at the Rogel Cancer Center while the poison pumped through her veins — just enough to kill the cancer but not enough to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Elissa couldn’t see straight, couldn’t think straight. Her head was in her hands, eyes to the floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Elissa and Russell absorbed the emotional news, a text was sent alerting the newsroom that Elissa wouldn't be able to finish working. “Oh god,” the coworker responded via text. “I’ve got it covered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Just about everyone at the Free Press knows there’s a fragile tightrope Elissa walks, one that could unravel at any moment. But she’s been so reliable in working through her cancer treatments that many probably don’t realize the pressure she puts on herself to be sharp enough, to have enough stamina to be “on” at work every day so her cancer is never an excuse, so she never lets down colleagues who also are friends and almost an extended family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I’m sorry,” she said in the room that day. “I know this isn’t the story you were hoping for, and it sucks. I’ve never been the perfect patient, you know?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nobody expects perfect, Russell told her. It’s too much pressure for anyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We’ll get through it,” he said. “We’ll do what we have to do, right? Every step of the way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Already, Elissa has beaten the odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She has lived almost four years past diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;According to data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, just 19.3% of people with stage 4 colon cancer survive to reach that milestone.

And beyond that, clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A December chill settled in, and Elissa felt it in her core.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It wasn’t just the cold air, but an increasingly foreboding pain — as if she could feel cancer’s ferocious bite in the ache below her rib cage, no matter how much chemo pumps through the port in her chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I would never tell my family this, but I do not have a good feeling at all,” Elissa said through tears on an afternoon in mid-December. “I've never had pain before. I have pain now where my liver is. I am really afraid that this shit has just gotten out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Everybody says you have to be positive. You have to think positive. But it's impossible not to think: Is this my last Christmas with my family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I'm kind of to the point where I've got to say, ‘I'm not willing to accept that.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She and Russell relentlessly read all they can about the latest advances in colon cancer treatments and seek doctors leading the cutting-edge work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"People think that you need to be a special person or something to be able to go to these hospitals, but you don't," Elissa said. "You can be just an average, everyday person. Just call the phone number and they will make you a patient. There's no secret sauce to try and get into the best institutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80498427007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-13-mw.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=654&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80498427007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-13-mw.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1308&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson, 40, of Macomb Township, left, helps her daughter, Harper, 9, get ready for school on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024, before she travels with her husband, Russell Robinson, to the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor to have a new procedure approved by the FDA, of noninvasive histotripsy to treat cancerous spots on her liver.

I'm 40 years old. I need more.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She sought an appointment with renowned surgical oncologist Dr. Yuman Fong at City of Hope near Los Angeles, who, in early October, told Elissa what she dreamed to hear: “You’re still curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He suggested she undergo surgery to remove the stubborn mass on her liver, which resisted attempts at thermal ablation and histotripsy. But now that there are more lesions on her liver, he said he’d like to see her next set of scans — taken just before Christmas — to decide how to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“He says that he would probably cut out the bad tumor that won't respond and then put me on a … hepatic arterial infusion pump — or a HAI pump. It's relatively new. You can't get it just anywhere,” Elissa said. “Basically, it's like a pump that has the chemo inside of it, and they implant it under your skin. So it would be near my liver, and it delivers the chemo directly to my liver instead of through my whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It's just a straight shot to my liver, and essentially, every two weeks you go and you get it refilled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The problem with that strategy, Elissa said, is that she has cancer outside of her liver, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I have disease in my lungs,” she said. “So if I'm only sending chemo to my liver, what's happening to my lungs?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Fong told her treatment with the HAI pump can delay the development of lung nodules for as long as two years, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But of course, “I already have lung nodules, so that’s not very reassuring. It begs the question: Are we just going to let my lungs grow out of control for the sake of my liver if we do this HAI pump?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another surgeon suggested radiation could be added to the mix. A treatment called Y90, or yttrium90, would imbed radioactive beads into the blood vessels that feed her liver tumors, targeting the cancer but not the healthy liver tissue around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And Mendiratta-Lala, the interventional radiologist at U-M who first treated Elissa with histotripsy a year ago, suggested she also could try histotripsy again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By early 2025, Mendiratta-Lala had treated 45 patients with it outside of clinical trials.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We don't have enough patient data, but I think in some of our patients, we see a little bit of the abscopal response with certain cancer types,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The question is what might be triggering the response in some patients but not others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If we can find a way to truly elicit the immune system, perhaps in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, I think it can change the face of cancer, because patients can have a better prognosis. You can see cancer regressing and disappearing everywhere in the body. And again, it's very early, so I use caution when I say that, but as a researcher and a clinician, that would be a dream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa also met with &lt;a href="https://www.karmanos.org/karmanos/video-library/meet-dr-mohammed-najeeb-al-hallak-1236" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Mohammed Najeeb Al Hallak&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist who specializes in gastrointestinal cancers and leads clinical trials at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She acknowledged, however, that she’s been holding onto the clinical trial card until she has little else in her hand to play. The odds that she’ll beat the dealer by enrolling in a clinical trial are slim, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Clinical trials are for the benefit of the trial,” Elissa said. “They’re not really for your benefit. Really, you are helping them. The likelihood of finding a real benefit to you is not great. … It feels like the last resort — like, 'OK, this is it. It’s all we’ve got.' ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And with the addition of that nagging abdominal pain, these questions swirled in Elissa’s mind with growing urgency: Which treatment would give her the most time with Harper, with Russell, with Betty and Sam? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;How would each of these options affect the quality of the life she has left to spend with them? Is the dream of being cancer-free completely unachievable now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to think about how aggressive you want to be, which is a really scary thing,” she said. “How do you make that decision? Of course, I want to do everything I possibly can to fight it, but do I keep fighting it until the writing is on the wall and give up my quality of life along the way?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa told Russell she wanted to draft end-of-life planning documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Just the other day, I was telling him, ‘We don't have any of our paperwork lined up,’ ” Elissa said in late December. “So I told him, ‘We really need to get our affairs in line.’ And you know, he agrees, but he's also like, ‘I don't want you giving up. I don't want you to lose hope and just start resigning yourself to this is what the future is going to be.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“And I said, ‘I'm not. I'm really not. But I also don't want to have to worry about this when I can't think straight anymore or it's too hard to think about or whatever. We have to think about these things now. … We haven't actually done that yet, but it's just another conversation, another thing on the to-do list. It's not fun to think about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80484389007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-02-mw.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=575&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80484389007-elissa-histotripsy-022824-02-mw.jpg?width=1960&amp;amp;height=1150&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson, 40, of Macomb Township, goes through her morning routine on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2024, as a family photo sits at right that includes her husband, Russell, and daughter, Harper.

He has a more aggressive approach than (Memorial Sloan Kettering) seemed to take. … He made it sound like he could get this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“He would go after the big one first, and then go back, probably a month later, to get another one or two. … As exciting as that sounds, it’s also terrifying. Literally every doctor has a different opinion on what I should be doing. How are you supposed to make a decision?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Jan. 22, Elissa's microwave ablation was performed at Karmanos in Detroit, the same day that would have been her brother Nick's 43rd birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I know he's always with me," Elissa said, "but I said a little prayer, and included Nick and asked him to put in a good word for me. ... It was like I needed a little more that day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Aoun treated the stubborn, 3.5-cm liver tumor using heat created with microwave energy to burn away the malignant tissue. He burned an additional 3.5 cm of tissue around the mass to ensure he got clean margins — killing off any potential cancer cells lurking at the edges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80499796007-20250126-071255.jpg?crop=1808,3216,x0,y1&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=534&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/26/PDTF/80499796007-20250126-071255.jpg?crop=1808,3216,x0,y1&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=1068&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Elissa Robinson recovers four days after a Jan. 22, 2025, ablation procedure at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Elissa Robinson recovers four days after a Jan. 22, 2025, ablation procedure at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit." data-c-credit="Elissa Robinson, Detroit Free Press"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In all, he destroyed 7 cm of her liver. Elissa thought she’d go home the same day, but the pain was the worst she’d experienced after any of her previous treatments. Within a few hours of surgery, she spiked a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Elissa ended up staying in the hospital for four nights as nurses and doctors waited for her fever to break, for the antibiotics to work, for her body to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When she finally was discharged, she said it was a relief to get back home to Russell and Harper, and to prepare for the ocean cruise she and her family planned to celebrate her 41st birthday. The ship departed from Galveston, Texas, and stopped in Roatan, Honduras, along with a couple of ports in Mexico.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She longed for balmy days, gliding across the shimmering blue water of the Gulf of Mexico, soaking up the sun with her favorite people, knowing that maybe, just maybe, better news would await when she returned to Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Robinsons' plane landed at Detroit Metro Airport on Monday evening, and Elissa was scheduled for an MRI at Karmanos the next day. Soon after, she learned that while the ablation was successful in destroying the large, stubborn tumor, a blood clot had formed in one of the veins in her liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Now, she is taking a blood thinner and evaluating her next steps. Will future microwave ablations even be an option to target her remaining liver tumors, given the bleed risk blood thinners pose?

López-Gil’s work emphasizes the need for standardized diagnostic criteria for the condition. “More research is needed, but that doesn’t mean [orthorexia] isn’t a real and significant condition,” says López-Gil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="J7EV2WJWLBHIZOUXL7EZF5AWLA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="J7EV2WJWLBHIZOUXL7EZF5AWLA"&gt;Social media connection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AVFORB7Z6RDLLKILYUCRSUH3LE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts say social media plays a role in perpetuating orthorexia, although the extent is unclear. “It’s hard to tell if there’s an uptick in orthorexia because we’re better at recognizing it, or because of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10032524/" target="_blank"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wildes. “Most likely, it’s both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KLFSV2MUOZDQTJFX4OYWIOTOF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;López-Gil says &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666323000752#bib38" target="_blank"&gt;higher social media use&lt;/a&gt; correlates with increased orthorexia symptoms, particularly within online “clean eating” communities.

You don’t necessarily have to throw these spuds away, however — but you do need to proceed with caution. Sprouts are small, and the potato still firm? You can safely cut off the sprouts and continue eating. But if the potato is soft, wrinkled or the sprouts are long, your best bet is to toss it: sprouts contain glycoalkaloids, a natural toxin, which can cause stomach upset or more serious health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:27;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tell-sprouted-potatoes-safe-eat-161500115.html" data-ylk="slk:prevent potatoes from sprouting;cpos:27;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;prevent potatoes from sprouting&lt;/a&gt; in the first place, store them in a cool, dark and dry location in a breathable container like a burlap sack. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:28;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/psa-youre-storing-potatoes-onions-200000719.html" data-ylk="slk:Keep them away from onions;cpos:28;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Keep them away from onions&lt;/a&gt;, which release ethylene gas, speeding up the sprouting process.

Responding positively to these bids, whether with an encouraging smile or an enthusiastic “yes” to their interests, strengthens relationships and fosters deeper connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Try it yourself: Listen intently to your spouse as they talk about the latest novel they’re reading for their book club, indulge your dad in another round of Scrabble or lean in the next time your friend wants to talk about her latest workplace drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;🐟 &lt;strong&gt;Get your B12 in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:31;pos:1" class="link " href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27200" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new study;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:31;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Neurology found that older adults with &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:32;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/low-levels-vitamin-were-just-192400011.html" data-ylk="slk:lower active B12 levels;cpos:32;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;lower active B12 levels&lt;/a&gt; had slower thinking and more white matter brain lesions, which are linked to dementia.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a title="Grist" href="https://grist.org"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt;. Sign up for Grist’s &lt;a title="Weekly newsletter" href="https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;amp;utm_source=partner"&gt;weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Two white men in their 60s live hundreds of miles away from each other, one in Arizona and the other in Washington state. They are the same age and have identical socioeconomic backgrounds. They also have similar habits and are in roughly the same physical shape. But the man in Arizona is aging more quickly than the man in Washington — 14 months faster, to be exact. Neither man smokes or drinks. Both exercise regularly. So why is the subject living in the desert Southwest more than a year older at the cellular level than his counterpart in the Pacific Northwest?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr0616"&gt;study published this week&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science Advances makes the case that extreme heat is aging millions of Americans more quickly than their counterparts in cooler climates. The impact of chronic exposure to high temperatures, researchers found, is equivalent to the effect of habitual smoking on cellular aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;As global average temperatures continue to rise due to the greenhouse gas effect caused by burning fossil fuels, wider swaths of the global population are being exposed to extreme heat, which has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/climate/heat-deaths.html#:~:text=Heat%20kills%20more%20people%20in,a%20significant%20upswing%20since%202016."&gt;killed more than 21,000 Americans since 1999&lt;/a&gt;. In 2023, Phoenix, Arizona, where some of the people analyzed in the study live, saw &lt;a href="https://grist.org/extreme-heat/31-days-at-110-degrees-record-heat-tests-phoenixs-limits/"&gt;31 days straight of temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt;. That year was the &lt;a href="https://grist.org/science/mysterious-x-factor-2023-heat-records/"&gt;warmest year on record&lt;/a&gt; globally — a record that was &lt;a href="https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hottest-year-on-record-2024-climate-threshold-1-5c/"&gt;quickly surpassed by 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Exposure to above-average heat has &lt;a href="https://grist.org/extreme-heat/extreme-heat-will-cost-the-us-1-billion-in-health-care-costs-this-summer-alone/"&gt;serious short-and long-term health repercussions&lt;/a&gt;. People may experience heat-related illness, such as dehydration and fainting, or sustain heat stroke — the most serious form of heat-related illness that can lead to death. Older adults and young children are particularly vulnerable to these impacts because they have trouble thermoregulating, or maintaining a steady internal body temperature. Over months and years, heat exposure can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/risk-factors/heat-and-chronic-conditions.html"&gt;exacerbate existing chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; like kidney and cardiovascular disease, and raise a person’s risk of &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/extreme-heat-can-take-a-toll-on-mental-health"&gt;mental health issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8739554/#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20exposure%20to%20a,et%20al.%2C%202019)."&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Eun Young Choi, a postdoctoral gerontological researcher at the University of Southern California’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and the lead author of the study, wanted to find out what might be driving the long-term health consequences of exposure to extreme heat on a cellular level, particularly in people approaching their 60s. She was particularly interested in “nonclinical manifestations” of heat exposure, meaning she hoped to capture how heat was affecting people who weren’t showing up in emergency rooms with heat-related illness or heat stroke. Her hypothesis was that heat was chipping away at overall health, whether or not someone could feel it acutely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;In order to test that theory, Choi analyzed blood samples from more than 3,600 people over the age of 56 who had participated in a large national health and retirement study. Those participants had taken a blood test in 2016 or 2017. Choi and her coauthor, Jennifer Ailshire, then used weather and climate data to estimate how many “heat days,” as defined by the National Weather Service, each participant had been exposed to in the years, months, and days leading up to the date of the blood test. They sorted the participants into demographic groups based on race, socioeconomic status, exercise habits, and other factors, and then compared the people in those groups to each other using a series of biological tests that determine how quickly a person’s cells are aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Next&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://grist.org/extreme-heat/a-crisis-of-isolation-is-making-heat-waves-more-deadly/"&gt;A crisis of isolation is making heat waves more deadly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“With longer-term heat exposure — one year and six years — we see a consistent association between heat and [cellular] age” across different biological tests, Choi said. People living in places where temperatures are at or above 90 degrees F for half of the year have experienced up to 14 months more biological aging compared to people living in areas with fewer than 10 days of temperatures at or above 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“This study is one of the first empirical assessments suggesting that longer-term exposure to heat is directly associated with an acceleration of the aging process,” said Vivek Shandas, a professor at Portland State University who studies the effects of climate change on cities and was not involved in the study.  It “adds to the existing work by suggesting that near-term mortality may be the result of older adults having longer-term and periodic exposures to heat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Two &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024001673"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023003823"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; found that people exposed to heat age more quickly, and studies in mice &lt;a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/JP280518"&gt;consistently show that heat ages cells&lt;/a&gt;, but Choi’s study is the first nationally representative research to draw the connection. The size and diversity of her pool of subjects helped drown out many of the factors that usually sully this type of data. Choi didn’t find any major differences between demographics — an indication that heat damages cells across the board in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;What Choi didn’t account for, however, are all the ways people adapt to protect themselves from heat. Some people, particularly wealthier Americans, might stay inside with the air conditioning blasting all day and night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Previous research has shown that above-average temperatures don’t affect all populations equally. Extreme heat is particularly dangerous for people who live in urban areas with patchy tree cover and lots of concrete. These zones, in places like New York City and Chicago, are called urban heat islands, and they can get &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/what-are-heat-islands#:~:text=A%20review%20of%20research%20studies,2%E2%80%935%C2%B0F%20higher."&gt;up to 7 degrees F hotter&lt;/a&gt; than surrounding rural areas. Urban heat islands tend to coincide with neighborhoods where &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/another-legacy-of-redlining-unequal-exposure-to-heat-waves/"&gt;nonwhite communities were historically confined by racist zoning practices&lt;/a&gt;, which is one reason that the average person of color &lt;a href="https://seas.umich.edu/news/urban-heat-islands-and-climate-inequities-0#:~:text=Urban%20heat%20islands%20and%20environmental,conducted%20by%20Hsu%20et%20al."&gt;is exposed to more severe heat&lt;/a&gt; in urban areas than the average non-Hispanic white person. These populations are also less likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/disparities-in-access-to-air-conditioning-and-implications-for-heat-related-health-risks/"&gt;able to afford air conditioning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“We know that some demographics, such as those working outside, unhoused populations, people living in urban heat islands, incarcerated populations, and lower-income residents generally have longer periods of exposure to extreme heat (over decades),” Shandas said. “Accordingly, we might draw on these findings to suggest that some certain populations will need greater attention and care as we see forecasts for heat waves.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Choi hopes future studies will continue to tease out these differences, particularly because by 2040, &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/program-retirement-policy/projects/data-warehouse/what-future-holds/us-population-aging#:~:text=The%20US%20Population%20Is%20Aging,aging%20could%20strain%20government%20budgets."&gt;1 in 5 Americans will be 65 or older&lt;/a&gt; — up from 1 in 8 in the year 2000. The results of Choi’s study also have implications for all age groups, not just people in their 50s and older. “I don’t think the underlying biology is significantly different,” she said. “We would expect to see some significant effects of heat in younger adults. And we really need to track people from their birth to older ages to see whether any of these effects can be reversible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://grist.org/health/extreme-heat-cellular-age-aging-smoking/"&gt;https://grist.org/health/extreme-heat-cellular-age-aging-smoking/&lt;/a&gt;.

"It maintains a firm grip on a large portion of the adult population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I personally have seen the ravages of this — hungover victims turn to meth, cocaine and other drugs for the ‘pick me up’ they feel they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many young people, alcohol is the first substance they try, according to Chris Tuell, a clinical psychotherapist and a chemical and behavioral addiction specialist at the Lindner Center in Mason, Ohio.

"Other things they might not normally do become easier to justify or accept as an idea to act on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a neurological element that comes into play, according to Dr. David Campbell, clinical director and program director at Recover Together Bend in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol affects neurotransmitter systems that are involved in the reward pathways that are similarly targeted by other drugs," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from the National Institute of Drug Abuse suggests that early exposure to alcohol can "prime the brain" for heightened responses to other drugs, perhaps increasing the risks of the "gateway effect," Campbell added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts emphasized that correlation does not equal causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just because people who use harder drugs often drink alcohol first does not necessarily mean alcohol caused their drug use," Tuell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"There are few drugs where the sudden stoppage of their use can be deadly — alcohol is one of these," an addiction specialist warned.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell agreed, noting that many "contextual factors and psychosocial stressors" should be considered within the broader context of someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Social environment, stressors, ease and proximity to access, social influences, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mental health conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, childhood trauma, genetics and other biological factors may all play a role," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spielvogel shared some warning signs that someone may be dependent on alcohol and more susceptible to trying other harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One sign is if they have ever tried to cut down on their drinking and failed," he said.

			&lt;p&gt;Liquifying your oranges, celery, beets, and apples into a delicious drink is commonly seen as a refreshing way boost nutrient intake while 'cleansing' the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study now shows that even a few days of swapping all of our humble fruit and veg for a juiced version in what's known as a 'juice fast' could deprive us of the fiber we need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign recruited 14 volunteers and split them into three groups for three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group stuck exclusively to juiced food items, one group just had plant-based food, and one group had juice and non-juice food items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The juice-only participants presented significant changes in mouth bacteria, consistent with increased sugar intake. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonadota"&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, linked to inflammation, was one of the groups of bacteria that rose in number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153671" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/BacteriaChart.jpg" alt="Bacteria chart" class="wp-image-153671 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/BacteriaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/BacteriaChart-600x352.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153671" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at bacteria levels across the three diets. (Sardaro et al., &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in gut microbes were less pronounced than those in the mouth, though three days of juicing still made a difference: bacteria linked to increased inflammation and even &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpgi.00190.2011"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; made up a greater proportion of the microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people think of juicing as a healthy cleanse, but this study offers a reality check," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/02/juicing-may-harm-your-health-in-just-3-days-new-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University integrative and culinary medicine physician Melinda Ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Consuming large amounts of juice with little fiber may lead to microbiome imbalances that could have negative consequences, such as inflammation and reduced gut health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting the small sample size used in the study, and that the researchers found that the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-could-help-explain-success-of-protein-pacing-diets"&gt;bacteria mixes&lt;/a&gt; went back to normal after a couple of weeks – suggesting no long-term impact from a few days of juicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the speed with which potentially dangerous bacteria increased and healthy bacteria decreased definitely justifies more research on this topic. That should give us a better understanding of how these bacteria shifts might be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think the removal of fiber from the fruit and vegetables turned into juice could be key. Fiber typically balances out the sugar in these foods, and promotes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-fiber-could-protect-you-from-infections-heres-why"&gt;the spread of healthier bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097822000209"&gt;protect against inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The nutritional composition of juice diets – specifically their sugar and carbohydrate levels – plays a key role in shaping microbial dynamics in both the gut and oral cavity and should be carefully considered," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/02/juicing-may-harm-your-health-in-just-3-days-new-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; food microbiologist Maria Luisa Savo Sardaro from Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet, and most of us need to be &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30041-8/fulltext"&gt;eating more of them&lt;/a&gt;. Juices can be one way of getting these foods into our diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers want to see further studies that explore longer term impacts, especially in terms of oral health, with the mouth the first part of our bodies to see the beneficial or harmful effects of what we're eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This highlights how quickly dietary choices can influence health-related bacterial populations," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/02/juicing-may-harm-your-health-in-just-3-days-new-study-finds/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ring. "The oral microbiome appears to be a rapid barometer of dietary impact."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you love juicing, consider blending instead to keep the fiber intact, or pair juices with whole foods to balance the impact on your microbiome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/458"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The best treatment for a hard knock on the head might someday involve a quick sniff of a nasal spray. Researchers have found early evidence in mice that an antibody-based treatment delivered up the nose can reduce the brain damage caused by concussions and more serious traumatic injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Mass General Brigham conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01877-7"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. In brain-injured mice, the experimental spray appeared to improve the brain’s natural acute healing process while also reducing damaging inflammation later on. The findings could lead to a genuine prophylactic against the long-term impacts of traumatic brain injuries and other conditions like stroke, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, are a persistent public health problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 200,000 Americans were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/traumatic-brain-injury/data-research/index.html"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; by a TBI in 2020, while nearly 70,000 died as a result. Scientists are also learning that TBIs, including the mild ones that we call concussions, can cause lingering neurological issues and may even &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12315"&gt;raise the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; decades later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there are ways to reduce the acute harm caused by TBIs, such as plenty of rest for concussions or surgery for serious injuries, there’s no established medication for preventing the chronic effects of it (that said, brain rehabilitation therapy is often an important part of recovery). In recent years, however, Mass General Brigham researchers have been studying an experimental lab-made antibody called foralumab that’s shown promise for neurological conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/articles/foralumab"&gt;multiple sclerosis.&lt;/a&gt; So they decided to see whether foralumab might also be useful for TBIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foralumab, developed by the company Tiziana Life Sciences, targets a specific group of proteins that interact with the brain’s immune cells, called CD3. This suppression of CD3, the team’s earlier work has &lt;a href="https://journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/181/9/6038/78846/Nasal-Anti-CD3-Antibody-Ameliorates-Lupus-by"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;, increases the activity of certain immune cells known as regulatory T cells (Treg). As the name implies, these cells help regulate the brain’s immune response to make sure it doesn’t go haywire.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability—including cognitive decline—and chronic inflammation is one of the key reasons,” said lead researcher Saef Izzy, head of the Immunology of Brain Injury Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1075077"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Mass General.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their latest mice study, the researchers found that foralumab—via the increased activity of Treg cells—improved aspects of the brain’s immediate healing from a traumatic injury. The dosed mice’s microglia (the brain’s unique first line of immune defense) became better at eating and cleaning up after damaged cells, for instance. Afterward, the drug also appeared to prevent microglia from becoming chronically inflamed, As a result, relative to mice in a control group, mice treated with foralumab up to three days post-injury experienced greater improvements in their motor function and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that nasal anti-CD3 represents a promising new therapeutic approach for treating TBI and potentially other forms of acute brain injury,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies in mice and other animals are only the first step in proving that a new drug or vaccine can work as hoped. Quite obviously, more research is needed to validate the drug’s potential for TBI treatment. But foralumab has already shown early positive results in human trials for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/04/24/foralumab-eases-fatigue-most-spms-patients-access-program-report/"&gt;MS&lt;/a&gt;, with other trials for &lt;a href="https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/tiziana-life-sciences-to-dose-first-patient-with-moderate-alzheimers-disease-with-foralumab/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/tiziana-wins-funding-small-clinical-trial-als-intranasal-foralumab/#:~:text=Foralumab%20is%20an%20antibody%2Dbased,system%20activity%20in%20ALS%20patients."&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; having started or soon to be underway. That raises hope that this antibody can become a new and much needed treatment option for numerous brain conditions, TBI included.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

They move at about the same pace as a human walking. Most travel no more than around three miles in their lifetimes. But some will soar between approximately 131 and 951 feet above ground. When this happens, they catch a high-altitude &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/jet-stream#:~:text=Jet%20streams%20are%20relatively%20narrow,(9%2C100%20meters)%20in%20elevation." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:jet stream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;jet stream&lt;/a&gt; and can ride this powerful wind for 100 miles or more in one night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These trips appear to be purposeful, according to study author Tovi Lehmann, a mosquito ecologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Mosquitoes likely use the high-altitude winds to find resources elsewhere. And they can bring dangerous pathogens with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this mosquito movement important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The scientists captured over 1,000 mosquitoes moving at high altitudes over Mali and Ghana. They found mosquitoes carrying viruses like dengue, West Nile, M'poko, and avian malaria, per &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/mosquitoes-swept-high-altitude-winds-may-spread-diseases-far-and-wide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We cannot dismiss this movement of pathogens at altitude," Lehmann said.

Manufacturers often add supplements to compensate, but the incorporation of dietary fibers during processing &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114516002610"&gt;can hinder protein digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In addition, gluten-free products generally contain higher sugar levels compared with other products containing gluten. Long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet has been associated with &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12493"&gt;increased body mass index, or BMI, and nutritional deficiencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Gluten-free products — defined in the U.S. as those that contain less than or equal to 20 parts per million of gluten — largely lack wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes oats, all rich sources of &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11071026"&gt;arabinoxylan&lt;/a&gt;, a crucial nonstarch polysaccharide. &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11071026"&gt;Arabinoxylan provides several health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, including promoting beneficial gut bacteria, enhancing digestion, regulating blood sugar levels, and supporting a balanced gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Our study also pointed out that it is difficult to find a gluten-free product that excels in all nutritional areas, such as high protein and fiber content with low carbohydrates and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;On the other hand, gluten-free seeded bread contains significantly more fiber — 38.24 grams per 100 grams — than &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-024-01264-w"&gt;its gluten-containing counterparts&lt;/a&gt;.

Your daily habits can significantly influence how your brain performs, no matter how old you are. And simple tweaks can help keep your brain performing at its peak. If you’re looking to make changes to your daily routine to better cognitive function, experts recommend focusing on your morning schedule. The things you do first thing in the morning can significantly impact cognitive function. We spoke to three neurologists about the best morning habits to help improve your cognitive function throughout the day.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-drink-a-glass-of-water"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Drink a Glass of Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Optimal hydration is critical for your body and brain to function at its best. Drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning can help replenish your fluid needs, which, in turn, benefits your brain. “While we’re sleeping, our bodies experience the longest stretch of time without drinking or eating–essentially fasting,” says &lt;a href="https://guides.upstate.edu/women-in-medicine/sharon-brangman" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sharon A. Brangman, M.D., FACP, AGSF&lt;/a&gt;. “Staying hydrated helps prevent fatigue and can boost your short-term memory, attention, and reaction throughout the day.” Water should be the primary beverage for hydration, but other traditional morning beverages like coffee and tea can also contribute to hydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Expose Your Face to Natural Light &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Light and dark exposure throughout the day greatly influences the body’s circadian rhythm (your inner clock). “Getting outside (or even sitting by a bright window) within 30 minutes of waking helps reset your circadian rhythm, making you more alert during the day and priming your body for better sleep at night,” says&lt;a href="https://1md.org/pages/doctor/dr-alexander-zubkov" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Alexander Zubkov, M.D&lt;/a&gt;. This might mean sitting on a sunny porch for breakfast or allowing natural light to come into the room when you first wake up. No matter how you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-boost-energy-8425516" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;expose yourself to morning light&lt;/a&gt;, research shows it can benefit everything from mood to alertness and reaction time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Replace Screen Time with Face-to-Face Conversation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The evidence is really adding up–looking at screens for most of the day is not good for&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “While many of us turn to our screens first thing in the morning, face-to-face interaction is better stimulation for your brain,” says Brangman. “Starting your day with in-person interaction can decrease isolation and loneliness, risk factors for cognitive decline.” Brangman recommends going for a walk with a neighbor, grabbing breakfast with a friend or attending a religious service, fitness class or book club.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise can have profound &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/why-exercise-is-good-for-your-brain-8778043" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;effects on your brain&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows a cognitive benefit immediately after physical activity as well as a long-term protective effect against cognitive deficits later in life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Starting your day with some form of physical activity is one way to improve cognitive function throughout the day. “You don’t need an intense workout first thing in the morning, but a little movement—whether it’s stretching, yoga, or a short walk—sends oxygen and nutrients to your brain, improving focus and energy,” says Zubkov.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Practicing mindfulness when you wake up may seem daunting with rushed schedules, but even a few moments set aside for quiet reflection can be beneficial for cognitive function. “Whether it’s a few deep breaths, a quick meditation, or journaling, a mindful start to the day lowers stress hormones like cortisol and helps you feel more clear-headed and focused.” Zubkov.

Eat a Nutrient-Dense Breakfast &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a nutrient-dense breakfast helps to stabilize blood sugar and provide energy throughout the morning. The morning meal also offers an opportunity to eat nutrients known to benefit brain health, which is one of the many reasons why&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; skipping breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is not recommended. However, choosing nutrient-dense foods is essential to ensure optimal cognitive function. This means limiting high-added-sugar foods like sugar-sweetened cereals, pastries and sugary beverages, which may negatively impact your brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Instead, go for a breakfast with protein and healthy fats, like eggs with avocado, Greek yogurt with nuts and seeds, or a smoothie with protein powder and nut butter,” says Zubkov. “This keeps blood sugar stable and fuels your brain for the day ahead.”

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Quality Sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Research shows that insufficient sleep can have broad-reaching effects on health including disruptions in mood, while also resulting in a greater risk for developing chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Insufficient sleep also negatively influences key aspects of cognitive functioning, like reaction time, problem-solving, attention, learning and memory.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Getting a good night's sleep—at least 7-8 hours—is vital for your brain and cognitive function,” says Brangman. “Sleep also allows time to clean up and remove toxic substances from the brain.” &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872589/habits-healthy-evening-routine/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Practice good sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; by going to bed around the same time each night, avoiding screens in the hour before bed and waking around the same time each morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Nutrients to Support Brain Health: &lt;/strong&gt;A balanced diet is essential for your whole body, including brain health. “A diet rich in nutrient-dense foods—think leafy greens, berries, salmon, and whole grains—provides a steady supply of vitamins and minerals that support brain health,” says&lt;a href="https://www.myisaachealth.com/joelsalinasmd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Joel Salinas, M.D., M.B.A., M.Sc., FAAN&lt;/a&gt;. Certain nutrients may play a more important role in brain health than others. These include B vitamins, unsaturated fats and protein, and other dietary compounds, including antioxidants and polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice “Mini-Resets”: &lt;/strong&gt;Supporting cognitive health throughout the day can often mean allowing time for breaks or mini-resets. “Frequent movement breaks can help you refocus if you’ve been sitting or concentrating for too long, so stand up periodically, stretch, or take a brisk walk to boost both circulation and mental clarity,” says Salinas. “Giving your brain regular “mini-resets” by stepping away from tasks every hour or so can also help you avoid mental fatigue.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best way to care for your brain is to be consistent with simple habits supporting cognitive health. Start by focusing on habits in your morning routine that will keep your brain sharp throughout the day. These include a short meditation, time away from screens (bonus if this is done outside) and a nutrient-dense breakfast. Once you’ve mastered the morning, you can continue to build additional brain-boosting habits into your day that will help you improve your cognitive function over time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Archdiocese of San Antonio has addressed the low vaccination rates in Catholic schools as cases of measles rise in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, the Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/texas-measles-outbreak-latest-numbers-20193938.php" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;has reported the measles outbreak increased from 124 to 146&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, February 28. That figure includes cases confirmed in nine counties across West Texas and the Texas Panhandle. Out of the total cases, an unvaccinated child died in Lubbock County, health officials announced on Wednesday, February 26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the cases stem from Gaines County, a community with a low vaccination rate at 81.97%. Dr. Jason Bowling, professor and infectious diseases specialist at UT Health San Antonio and chief epidemiologist at University Health, told MySA the magic number recommended in a community is 95% or higher vaccinated. Herd immunity means that enough people in the community have been vaccinated so that there's less risk of measles being able to move from person to person, decreasing the risk of an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bexar County's MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners is at a 94.2% coverage rate, according to Anita Kurian, deputy director for the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District. However, data shows 11 private schools were below the 95% coverage rate, with one at 40%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Archdiocese of San Antonio Gustavo García-Siller responded to the Catholic school vaccination rates and the polices the campuses. Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of San Antonio follow the immunization policy of the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops Education Department, García-Siller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy states that every student enrolled in a Catholic school in the state of Texas shall be immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases caused by infectious agents by the immunization schedule adopted by the DSHS. A student who fails to present the required evidence shall not be accepted for enrollment, García-Siller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Catholic schools do not accept students who have received a parental choice or religious exemption from the immunizations required by Texas state law. Conscientious objections or waivers, which may be permissible for attendance in public schools, do not qualify as an exemption in Catholic schools in Texas," García-Siller added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, García-Siller said the only exemption to the foregoing requirement is a medical exemption signed by a licensed physician authorized to practice in the state of Texas. All immunizations should be completed by the first date of attendance. The law requires that the students be fully vaccinated against the specified diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>mySA</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:45:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZjN4Vmk4T21SMldmRGFuOGRQQWstd0tOaFVFWDZpSVZDNl9RWHVuTEFVWDBQbElvUkpiX01GVUloZy1zcHItSklIMklsQkpMcThOblY1dGRVbDBFVmRYdDduaE9VZlV0N1pZdWZvMXFqak02TU9Gd3ZqNnU4Y01fTllSU0h4eGFQaVdTM0I1aVNBUTV5TVdzQUlvV0NZTmNTNnBfN3FidnNBZw</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu devastates Cranberry’s Seggond Chance Farm, a sanctuary for misfit birds - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNMTUweERfWk5IRllnR3lubkR1dVJidktwM0xZcm9UNndUQUtpN0tGOVdDT09xaE9NOV8xVl85ZUo3bUo1dnN5TldzV0I2dnppU1JpdnRuUXVoc2lDb1JhMWJuZ2MyYkxMSXlIVnlaRENYRzNtT3FoWFRNNFFJdk1KbGFrRGhtOVFqck5BQ1hfQTN6OEhBbUMyVmxzZkttb1YtYk5nbF94UkFzeUdLZVRxLXBRcUdybkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body class="pgevoke bs-grid pg-hasicomoon pg-site-pg pg-user-checkingstatus pg-requesttype-story pgevoke-pageparentsection-news pg-piano" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Could you tell me about that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professor said it was a "very exciting trial" which saw patients undergo six lifestyle interventions for 16 weeks, adding: "What they found at the end of the study and even at eight weeks at the midpoint, they saw dramatic improvements in the patient's joint disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "They looked more deeply to see what was the most likely thing driving this difference, and it was most likely diet. Of course, you can't separate out, it was a full holistic intervention of multiple different domains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Dr Katsumoto said she thought diet "played a huge role" in the remarkable results - especially anti-inflammatory foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25119#:~:text=The%20MD%20is%20considered%20to,is%20adapted%20to%20diverse%20cultures." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American College of Rheumatology (ACR);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American College of Rheumatology (ACR)&lt;/a&gt; recommends the Mediterranean diet (MD) as an anti-inflammatory eating pattern for people with arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Katsumoto praised the Blue Zone diet, which focuses heavily on plant-based foods, fish, grains, seeds, nuts, pulses, beans and lentils., cutting out a lot of dairy and meat products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The professor said the 'best' vegetables to eat to beat inflammation, were "cruciferous vegetables", adding: "These are things like broccoli, and kale, and cauliflower, and these really kind of the deep leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And they're so important. I really think food is medicine. And these are incredibly important in terms of helping our liver detoxify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're living in a very polluted world. I think that these are super helpful foods that can help us clear our body of a lot of these toxins, these endocrine disruptors, which we haven't talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But there's a lot of these things that we need to be thinking about that are super helpful for my patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued: "Another food type that I love a lot are things like chia seeds and flax seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think chia seeds are the perfect food.

Could you tell me about that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The professor said it was a "very exciting trial" which saw patients undergo six lifestyle interventions for 16 weeks, adding: "What they found at the end of the study and even at eight weeks at the midpoint, they saw dramatic improvements in the patient's joint disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;She added: "They looked more deeply to see what was the most likely thing driving this difference, and it was most likely diet. Of course, you can't separate out, it was a full holistic intervention of multiple different domains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;However Dr Katsumoto said she thought diet "played a huge role" in the remarkable results - especially anti-inflammatory foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25119#:~:text=The%20MD%20is%20considered%20to,is%20adapted%20to%20diverse%20cultures." target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt;American College of Rheumatology (ACR)&lt;/a&gt; recommends the Mediterranean diet (MD) as an anti-inflammatory eating pattern for people with arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Dr Katsumoto praised the Blue Zone diet, which focuses heavily on plant-based foods, fish, grains, seeds, nuts, pulses, beans and lentils., cutting out a lot of dairy and meat products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The professor said the 'best' vegetables to eat to beat inflammation, were "cruciferous vegetables", adding: "These are things like broccoli, and kale, and cauliflower, and these really kind of the deep leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"And they're so important. I really think food is medicine. And these are incredibly important in terms of helping our liver detoxify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"We're living in a very polluted world. I think that these are super helpful foods that can help us clear our body of a lot of these toxins, these endocrine disruptors, which we haven't talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"But there's a lot of these things that we need to be thinking about that are super helpful for my patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;She continued: "Another food type that I love a lot are things like chia seeds and flax seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"I think chia seeds are the perfect food. They're high in fibre, high in omega-3, and high in protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"They've just got so many great components that I add them to my smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"I just try to incorporate them wherever I can.

Sam, a 45-year-old nurse, had already seen Cora Perkins survive two types of cancer. During previous appointments, she had found Cora’s arms turning blue from diabetes, or her ankles swollen from congestive heart failure, or her stomach cramping from hunger with no fresh food left in the house. It had been a week since Sam’s last visit, and she wondered if anyone had come or gone through the front door since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She knocked, but nobody answered. She walked across the porch to a hole in the window and called into the house. “Cora, honey? Are you OK?” A light flickered inside. A dog began to bark. Sam pushed open the door and walked into the living room, where she found Cora wrapped under a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Sam. Thank God you’re here,” said Cora, 64. She tried to stand, but she lost her balance and sat back down in a recliner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It looks like you’re wobbly this morning,” Sam said. “Are you feeling really bad or just normal bad?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It was the same question she asked her patients dozens of times each week as she made home visits across West Virginia, traveling from one impending emergency to the next in a country where feeling bad had become the new normal. All 31 patients in her caseload for the Williamson Health and Wellness Center were under 65 years old, and yet each had at least one of the chronic diseases that had become endemic in the United States over the last two decades: death rates up 25 percent nationally from diabetes, 40 percent from liver disease, 60 percent from kidney disease, 80 percent from hypertension and more than 95 percent from obesity, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"It maintains a firm grip on a large portion of the adult population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I personally have seen the ravages of this — hungover victims turn to meth, cocaine and other drugs for the ‘pick me up’ they feel they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For many young people, alcohol is the first substance they try, according to Chris Tuell, a clinical psychotherapist and a chemical and behavioral addiction specialist at the Lindner Center in Mason, Ohio. This makes them more likely to experiment with other drugs later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Most people can &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/spirits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:use alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;use alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and it does not become problematic — but for some, it is destroying their lives," he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marijuana is often pegged as a "classic gateway drug," but one expert said that "alcohol is the king" when it comes to impairing judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consumption of alcohol impairs judgment and decision-making, which can lead to riskier behaviors, including trying other substances, Tuell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Studies indicate that alcohol alters brain chemistry in ways that increase susceptibility to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/addiction" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drug addiction;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;drug addiction&lt;/a&gt;," the expert cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/drinking-alcohol-linked-six-types-cancer-experts-say-toxic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Drinking Alcohol Is Linked To Six Types Of Cancer, Experts Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Drinking Alcohol Is Linked To Six Types Of Cancer, Experts Say&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jeremy Klemanski, addiction specialist and CEO of Gateway Foundation in Chicago, echoes his belief that alcohol is a gateway drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We often hear reports from patients that they only use or started using while drinking, or that they were first exposed to alcohol and then tried other drugs for greater &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:physical symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;physical symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and feelings," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from the National Institute of Drug Abuse suggests that early exposure to alcohol can "prime the brain" for heightened responses to other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is also important to note that once a person has used one mind-altering substance, their general thinking skills are impaired on some level," he went on. "Other things they might not normally do become easier to justify or accept as an idea to act on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is also a neurological element that comes into play, according to Dr. David Campbell, clinical director and program director at Recover Together Bend in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Alcohol affects neurotransmitter systems that are involved in the reward pathways that are similarly targeted by other drugs," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research from the National Institute of Drug Abuse suggests that early exposure to alcohol can "prime the brain" for heightened responses to other drugs, perhaps increasing the risks of the "gateway effect," Campbell added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts emphasized that correlation does not equal causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Just because people who use harder drugs often drink alcohol first does not necessarily mean alcohol caused their drug use," Tuell noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are few drugs where the sudden stoppage of their use can be deadly — alcohol is one of these," an addiction specialist warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Campbell agreed, noting that many "contextual factors and psychosocial stressors" should be considered within the broader context of someone’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Social environment, stressors, ease and proximity to access, social influences, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mental health conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, childhood trauma, genetics and other biological factors may all play a role," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Spielvogel shared some warning signs that someone may be dependent on alcohol and more susceptible to trying other harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"One sign is if they have ever tried to cut down on their drinking and failed," he said. "Also, they may be annoyed when asked about their alcohol consumption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with alcohol dependency may also feel guilty when they drink, or they might consume &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alcoholic beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;alcoholic beverages&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Stopping "cold turkey" may not be the healthiest route, Spielvogel cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There are few drugs where the sudden stoppage of their use can be deadly — alcohol is one of these," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I cannot stress this enough; it is very important that if someone has a use disorder, they seek professional help for their detox and recovery, whether it's a private treatment facility or going to a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:medical professional;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;medical professional&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Do not do this on your own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dangerous-gateway-drug-can-lead-substance-use-addiction-experts-warn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dangerous ‘gateway drug’ can lead to other substance use, addiction experts warn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dangerous ‘gateway drug’ can lead to other substance use, addiction experts warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 09:30:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNbEI1TTR5NFNsODdMVGZHOVhzRllKMXQ3WkhWeDhWaDFfT0VsSlZUQ1JLY1ZzUFRiSjBWMkJqdGdiZExUaF9wQ2pZaWRsUEtKVzF2aTJhQnlsQTJkZHBCRThjWHBoZ2FyYmpiWlFmN0RKZmdGdGYybDBmdXpJM3JHTA</guid></item><item><title>This Much Weekly Exercise Can Slash Your Dementia Risk by 41 Percent - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQMDNIeFVIQ09CeGZubzdnMUJyVkhtRTdXNUhHdmZOcXhJbldzRERpakNuMm5zSHFyZVB4RGtOZkd4WXMwb09SclYyeEN6UkhQbmw4QzFyanVOal9TdjJWeHd5UU9zYlhXTHlYaWNCQXBQNWlTaTZnT2Q0dk9IRWVFMnhtb3AxMnpER0EtOHpNRTVmQlc4enJPRnhpS2gwZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study charts in detail the relationship &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-boost-linked-to-exercise-can-last-several-years-scientists-find"&gt;between physical activity and dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, with significant drops in risk requiring less of a physical workout than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from Johns Hopkins University in the US found that up to 35 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise every week is associated with a 41 percent drop in dementia risk, compared to those who didn't exercise at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other encouraging findings too: even the oldest among us can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; by increasing our weekly activity, and even just a few minutes of exercise a week can have protective effects for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153011" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1.jpg" alt="Dementia chart" class="wp-image-153011 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1.jpg 2772w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-642x363.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-734x415.jpg 734w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-768x434.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-1536x869.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-2048x1158.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/DementiaChart-1-600x339.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2772px) 100vw, 2772px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153011" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers compared dementia cases against activity levels. (Wanigatunga et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that increasing physical activity, even as little as five minutes per day, can reduce dementia risk in older adults," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Amal Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data on 89,667 adults, with a median age of 63, across an average of 4.4 years. Data was logged using dedicated activity trackers worn on the wrist, which logged movement over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By also recording which participants went on to develop dementia, the researchers could link activity with dementia risk. Compared to those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-what-happens-if-you-dont-exercise-until-the-weekend"&gt;did no exercise&lt;/a&gt; at all, dementia risk was 60 percent lower for those who did 36–70 minutes of physical activity per week, and 63 percent lower in the 71–140 minutes category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who banked 140 minutes or more of physical activity per week, dementia risk was reduced by 69 percent. With so many potential factors at play, from diet to genetics, this doesn't prove direct cause and effect – but it does suggest exercise and brain health are closely linked (as we've seen in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-training-reduces-dementia-risk-by-almost-30-10-year-study-finds-speed-cognitive"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations remained more or less the same for participants classed as frail. The researchers are keen to stress that anyone at any stage of life can get the benefits from almost any level of additional exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that even frail or nearly frail older adults might be able to reduce their dementia risk through low-dose exercise," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you feel like you're not exercising as much as you should be, bear in mind that it's never too late to start. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercising-in-midlife-may-reverse-years-of-inactivity-large-study-finds"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that upping the amount of time you spend on the move and working out can help to reverse years of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research will be needed to explore why this association exists, but it makes sense that a healthier body means a healthier brain. Exercise &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-exercise-is-linked-to-larger-brain-volume-in-memory-and-learning-regions"&gt;has been shown&lt;/a&gt; to increase the size of areas of the brain associated with learning and remembering, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This adds to a growing body of evidence that some exercise is better than nothing, especially with regard to an aging-related disorder that affects the brain that currently has no cure," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/small-amounts-of-moderate-to-vigorous-physical-activity-are-associated-with-big-reductions-in-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;American Medical Directors Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy ― but there are some things you can do to bolster your odds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;″&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to live longer, improve what you’re eating and start moving your body more,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/health-and-wellness/recipes/contributors/dr-linda-shiue" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Linda Shiue" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/health-and-wellness/recipes/contributors/dr-linda-shiue" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Linda Shiue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internist and director of culinary and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But knowing exactly which foods to eat for a longer life can be tricky. Shiue says&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;that while no one needs to be perfect, it’s important to fill up on “foods in their natural state, like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and nuts.” By doing so, she said, we replace the “ultra-processed foods” in our diets, “such as shelf-stable foods that have refined carbs and high sugars, like white bread.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even when we know which foods are good for us, it can be hard to figure out the right balance of healthy options that give us a better chance of living longer ― and hard to find sweets that are good for us when the craving strikes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We asked three top longevity experts what’s in their grocery carts. Here’s what they told us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruciferous Vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All vegetables are packed with nutrition, but &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hri.org.au/health/your-health/nutrition/nutritional-benefits-of-cruciferous-vegetables" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cruciferous vegetables" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hri.org.au/health/your-health/nutrition/nutritional-benefits-of-cruciferous-vegetables" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cruciferous vegetables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; like broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts and cabbage are powerhouses at helping you live longer. That’s because they are rich in anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-aging phytonutrients, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drhyman.com/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Mark Hyman" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drhyman.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Mark Hyman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an author, family physician&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and director of the UltraWellness Center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in Lenox, Massachusetts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’re also an important source of magnesium, a mineral responsible for more than 600 enzyme reactions, Hyman said. Furthermore, c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ruciferous vegetables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="rich in folate" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;rich in folate&lt;/a&gt;, a B vitamin critical for DNA methylation ― the process that switches our longevity genes on and off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s really no upper limit on how many cruciferous vegetables you can eat, but a good rule is to cover about three-quarters of your plate with them,” Hyman suggested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Leafy Greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dark leafy greens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; are a type of cruciferous vegetable, but some longevity experts single them out as particularly important for living a long life. That’s because they are full of fiber and other plant chemicals such as folate, which is important to heart health, Shiue explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Folate can also" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Folate can also&lt;/a&gt; help reduce the risk of colon polyps and help prevent breast, lung and cervical cancer.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty Fish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fatty fish like wild salmon, sardines, anchovies, herring and mackerel are quality sources of protein and the essential omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, Hyman said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Eating salmon twice a week is enough to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/05/25/eating-fish-twice-a-week-reduces-heart-stroke-risk" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cut your risk" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c09237e4b09bdae0098ca0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2018/05/25/eating-fish-twice-a-week-reduces-heart-stroke-risk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cut your risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of heart attack, arrhythmia, stroke, high blood pressure and elevated triglycerides,” he explained.

They can also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and certain types of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Virgin Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to your health, not all oils are created equal. Extra virgin olive oil is rich in healthy monounsaturated fats, antioxidants and polyphenols like oleuropein, Hyman said.

  &lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/whole-foods-ramadan-cake/"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; officially starting, throngs of participants in the month-long food abstinence-a-thon will gobble up dates. Well, between the hours of sunset and sundown. But rather, as per Prophet Muhammad’s tradition, a trio of the fruits when the day’s fasting is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Date producers &lt;a href="https://www.producebluebook.com/2025/01/24/natural-delights-prepares-retailers-for-ramadan-dates/#:~:text=Last%20Ramadan%2C%20average%20weekly%20Medjool,and%20traditions%20across%20the%20country."&gt;experience massive sales upticks&lt;/a&gt; during the Holy Month as the food has long been synonymous with it. However, TikToker Kirti Tewani (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirtitewani"&gt;@kirtitewani&lt;/a&gt;) recently posted a viral TikTok that may give even the most famished faster pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a viral clip that’s accrued over 4.9 million views, she urges folks to take their dates apart. This way, they can check for any sneaky bits of mold that may be hiding inside the fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folks who watched her clip were stunned to see just how recessed these bits of mold were. This led a slew of people to worry that they’ve been chowing down on fungus filled dates for years.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-open-it-up"&gt;Open it up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is your reminder to always open your dates and look inside. And check properly,” Tewani says. She demonstrates her suggestion on camera throughout her narration. The TikToker peels a dried date fruit apart in front of the camera. Next, she splits it open and pushes the exterior, fleshy part of the date inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the whitish internals of the dried date pop outwards. Its upper portion is flecked with what appears to be black mold, which the TikToker is quick to point out. “Because sometimes you’re gonna find this mold and fungus,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally troubling, Tewani claims, is that these spores can form even when dried dates are properly sealed and packaged. In order to quell any alarmist thoughts, however, she offered an addendum to her PSA. And it’s that just because one date in a box has mold in it, doesn’t mean the entire assortment is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To exhibit this assertion, she then takes another date from her container. “Not all dates are gonna be like that so let’s check this one,” she states. Following this, she cracks open the fruit right up into the lens. Unlike the previous example, this one is completely devoid of mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-mold"&gt;Why mold?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most produce, dates are prone to getting moldy. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.narafood.de/en/blogs/news/dates-mold#:~:text=The%20juicier%20the%20dates%2C%20the,stored%20in%20a%20dry%20place."&gt;Nara Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.narafood.de/en/blogs/news/dates-mold#:~:text=The%20juicier%20the%20dates%2C%20the,stored%20in%20a%20dry%20place."&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt; that dates are extremely persistent fruits “that have a particularly long shelf life. So much so that “some varieties even keep for several years!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company goes on to state that fresh dates are best kept refrigerated. Conversely, dried dates must be stored “in a cool dry place.” This is especially true of varieties that are exceedingly juicy—keeping them cool is paramount to prevent spoilage.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, sealing fresh dates in air-tight containers will create the perfect environment for mold growth. This is due to the fruit’s moisture content having nowhere to “breathe” except in a tight, closed-off space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to dry dates, arid places are best. Steering them clear of any potential condensation build-up or moisture will minimize the chances of mold build-up. What helps to make storing dry dates an easier task is the fruits’ response to “temperature fluctuations.” &lt;em&gt;Nara&lt;/em&gt; indicates that dried dates “tolerate” such environmental aberrations “relatively well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="https://www.thebedouinway.com/bedouin-blog/2015/11/14/palm-trees-dates-the-south-sinai-bedouin"&gt;desert Bedouins were able to sustain themselves on these fruits&lt;/a&gt; since 4,000 BCE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@kirtitewani/video/7465728303773830446" data-video-id="7465728303773830446"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viewers-are-horrified"&gt;Viewers are horrified&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One viewer was quick to make a punny remark involving the name of the fruit. “I only do that after the third date,” they said, reacting to the way Temani pulled apart the date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, numerous others seemed horrified to learn this news. Due to how well-hidden the mold is in Temani’s dates, one TikToker arrived at a revolting conclusion. “I never thought to do that. I wonder how many moldy ones I’ve eaten,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a sentiment echoed by someone else: “I’ve definitely eaten moldy dates I have never checked.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;This potential fungi-filled date eater was exceedingly detailed. “Oh wow that’s crazy. I had dates one time that released a puff of dust when I bit into them. Maybe that was mold. Idk I just kept eating,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Dot has reached out to Temani via TikTok comment for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.
