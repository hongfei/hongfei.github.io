Now scientists are hopeful a key protein in the brain could reveal the likelihood of someone developing the disease so that preventative treatments can be administered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid plaques &lt;span&gt;are a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and contribute to cognitive decline and memory loss. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Notably, female mice had higher TSPO levels, mirroring real-world statistics: two-thirds of Alzheimer's patients are women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain tissue samples from the Colombian patients with the rare genetic mutation (PSEN1 E280A), known as the paisa mutation, that almost always leads to early-onset Alzheimer's, showed the same pattern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that elevated levels of TSPO - as seen in medical imaging of the brain - could indicate a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with strong genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's show elevated TSPO early, which supports the theory that brain inflammation is an early driver of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now want to look at this link further to better understand the role that TSPO plays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are unsure if it contributes to damage or protects the brain – and whether blocking or enhancing it could halt disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.fiu.edu/2025/can-we-detect-alzheimers-disease-decades-before-symptoms-start"&gt;Lead researcher&lt;/a&gt; Dr Tomás Guilarte said: 'This is the first study to really examine how early this biomarker increases and where it begins rising in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we can use this information to help delay Alzheimer's progression by even five years, it can drastically improve patients' lives and reduce disease prevalence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Guilarte is considered an internationally established expert on TSPO and he has studied the protein for more than three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His work helped establish it as a reliable imaging biomarker used in diagnosing brain inflammation in various neurodegenerative, neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in late-stage Alzheimer's, the researchers found that TSPO levels remained high in the immune cells in the brain (microglia) that are found close to amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A cell image showing immune cells in the brain (microglia) (blue) signaling TSPO (red) and clustered around plaques (cyan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Guilarte's previous study, published in JAMA Neurology, showed TSPO levels were higher in active and recently retired NFL players ranging in age from 23 to 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is now working with a specially developed Alzheimer's mouse model lacking TSPO to explore these questions further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're also expanding the study to include sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer's cases, the form that accounts for over 90 percent of all diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more we understand these processes,' said Daniel Martínez Pérez, first author and Ph. candidate in Dr Guilarte's lab, 'the closer we get to tailoring treatments that can truly help – before it's too late.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'One of the biggest problems with Alzheimer's is people see it as a disease of aging and that impacts when people get diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the reality is that the disease starts decades before diagnosis and the more biomarkers and therapeutic targets our global community of scientists are finding, the closer we all get to physicians having a whole panel of diagnostics to be able to deliver more personalized, tailored treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hope is we can be part of helping people before they are too sick.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About seven million people in the US aged 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13million Americans will be living with the disease. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;Five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly seven million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is not solely Alzheimer's disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it's passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jeopardized efforts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the IFRC requested $25 million to contain the outbreak, but it has only $2.2 million in emergency funds for its outbreak response so far. The WHO likewise estimated the cost of responding to the outbreak over the next three months to be $20 million. But WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that it only had $4.3 million in funding to draw from—a $2 million emergency fund and $2.3 million in funding from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Gavi vaccine alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities," Jasarevic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the US Agency for International Development, USAID, has provided critical support to respond to such outbreaks. But, with funding cuts and a dismantling of the agency by the Trump administration, the US is notably absent, and health officials fear it will be difficult to compensate for the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, told the AP that the US has provided "some small support" but declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amitié Bukidi, chief medical officer of the Mweka health zone—another health zone in the Kasai province—told the outlet that there was still much work to do to contain the outbreak. "The need is still very great,” he said. “If USAID were to be involved, that would be good."&lt;/p&gt;

Public Health tested the bat on Thursday, which showed it was positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two people who gave water to the bat have not been identified, and so far, no one else is known to have been exposed to the bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any person or animal that touched or had contact  with the bat or its saliva could get rabies, which is almost always fatal once symptoms begin, Public Health said. Time is of the essence for anyone who’s had contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contact includes touching a bat, being bitten, scratched, or any other bare skin contact with a bat or its saliva,” said Elysia Gonzales, Medical Epidemiologist at Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your pet may have been exposed to the bat, contact a veterinarian immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if pets are current on their rabies vaccine, they need to be revaccinated if they had contact with a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to do if you find a bat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;See a bat outside? Don’t touch it.

Public Health said to use a shovel or gloves to put a dead bat in a box for testing. &lt;em&gt;Do not throw it away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to safely capture a bat in your home and how to safely avoid bats, visit: &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/health-advisories/animal-bites/bats-and-rabies" target="_blank" title="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/health-advisories/animal-bites/bats-and-rabies" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;kingcounty.gov/bats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 16:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxORVY2Q0FxanozVnh2RmhiSTZvZXpFeUlpYi1Rc1NZcUNBNUdhU0szamVNWTdMWkloNEVlcl9FdzFLT0k0Y2lOREdqOTJ5aWVWZzQwYjB2elE0d3dZeWNvME8xSXViZUdNR2VoN0NrNThKNDJLNjBGYTh2dmxLSjhLN0JVSERsd2NGSjhPVWlCYjNTV1BIbEg5TFNTV1lLc3pWLTU5MVdZRXpkeTh3UmJJLVc1OWRBZjhGUUNWNnNZR0gwRjl3SlFjelBYT2RxRFpNYWZlSFFnV1o1TUs1S195UTJjYjBNOS00</guid></item><item><title>适量饮酒？研究警告说，即使少量饮酒也可能严重损害大脑健康|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/drinking-in-moderation-study-warns-even-small-amounts-of-alcohol-may-seriously-harm-brain-health-101758899427040.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/drinking-in-moderation-study-warns-even-small-amounts-of-alcohol-may-seriously-harm-brain-health-101758899427040.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/neurosurgeon-reveals-poor-sleep-is-worse-than-alcohol-for-your-brain-suggests-3-hacks-for-better-sleep-101758527952919.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="alcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; has the heavy drinker, tipping over into borderline addiction, this beverage also has its share of light drinkers.

(Shutterstock)" title="Alcohol wrecks havoc on cognitive functions of brain. (Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Alcohol wrecks havoc on cognitive functions of brain. (Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often, it is said that if something is consumed in moderation, the effects aren't disastrous, as long as one adheres to the safe limits. Likewise, the same was applied to alcohol, too. But the protective effects seen in the previous studies from light alcohol consumption were actually false, as people who later developed dementia actually drank less in the years leading up to the diagnosis, so this challenges the previously established findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a large study, including data from over half a million people, along with genetic information from 2 million more. In other words, the study was very extensive. The findings revealed that any alcohol consumption actually increases dementia risk. In addition, genetically predisposed people have a 15 to 16 per cent higher chance of developing dementia. Genetic risk here means being genetically vulnerable to alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings imply that even small amounts of alcohol in the long run damage your brain, setting you up for dementia later in life. The researchers urged that public health advice should not depict light drinking as safe or harmless, as it too carries significant risks. This is particularly true for middle-aged adults who have a high risk of cognitive decline; cutting down on alcohol may help reduce the risks of dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

        &lt;p&gt;A healthy 26-year-old woman’s sudden loss of heart function appears to have had an unusual cause: cannabis. In a recent report, her doctors described what they believe to be a rare case of cannabis-induced cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the WellStar Spalding Health System in Georgia &lt;a href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/full/idArt/950077"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the strange incident earlier this week in the American Journal of Case Reports. The woman appeared to have no preexisting heart problems or other reasons for her heart stopping outside her cannabis use, the doctors determined. The woman’s prolonged cardiac arrest caused serious but non-permanent brain injury, and she thankfully made a complete recovery following prolonged rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This case highlights the potential for cannabis use to induce life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias… even in young adults with no prior cardiovascular risk factors,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No other explanation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman’s fiancé heard her making an unusual noise in the bathroom, after which he found her unresponsive. He called over emergency services, who soon arrived and diagnosed her with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20364523"&gt;ventricular fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;: a life-threatening type of abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) caused by the heart’s lower chambers contracting rapidly and randomly; this then prevents the heart from pumping blood and oxygen normally to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The responding EMS team restored her blood circulation with advanced cardiac life support, and she was rushed over to the hospital. Though doctors stabilized her condition, she required intubation. The sustained loss of circulation resulted in major brain injury, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman had no structural heart disease prior to her cardiac arrest, nor a relevant family history or detected genetic markers that would predispose her to heart problems. The only thing that stood out, the doctors wrote, was the woman’s “heavy cannabis use” just before her cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though they can’t completely rule out other possibilities, such as a bout of myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) that went undiagnosed, the timing and lack of other clear explanations makes it “probable” that cannabis caused her cardiac arrest, the doctors concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A rare danger&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though cannabis is less dangerous than other legal recreational drugs like alcohol and cigarette smoking, there have been other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2783157/"&gt;rare reports&lt;/a&gt; of cannabis-induced cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors say this case is particularly unusual compared to those past reports, however, since it involved a healthy young adult with no other risk factors or preexisting heart issues that would have made them more vulnerable to cardiac arrest. That said, some research has also suggested that chronic cannabis use in general can potentially increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2023/02/23/18/53/Frequent-Marijuana-Use-Linked-to-Heart-Disease"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2025/03/24/13/52/Cannabis-Use-Substantially-Increases-Risk-of-Heart-Attack-acc-2025"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;. The authors also point to studies indicating that THC (the main ingredient responsible for the “high” of cannabis) can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32575540/"&gt;induce&lt;/a&gt; arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The lesson to take away&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the woman did require hospitalization for several weeks, both her heart and brain function gradually recovered. After her hospital trip, she was given a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator to monitor and ensure a healthy heart rhythm. The doctors wrote that she eventually made a “complete cardiac and neurological recovery.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rare as this sort of case might be, it’s likely that many people don’t even know about the possible cardiovascular risks of cannabis, the doctors say. So they hope their report can encourage further research into how the drug may negatively affect the heart, along with greater visibility of this issue in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Recreational cannabis use is steadily increasing among both adults and youth due to expanding legalization and easy accessibility, underscoring the urgent need for greater public and clinical awareness of its potential health risks,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

It is unknown how old the infected patient is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MMR shot is given in two doses to children between ages 12 and 15 months and again between ages four and six. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health department said that Utah keeps a stock of post-exposure prophylactic (PEP) globulin, an antibody-based treatment used to provide short-term protection against infectious diseases like measles, tetanus and respiratory syncytial virus (&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/rsv/index.html" id="mol-b1c30d20-9adf-11f0-9a6c-17cc9a9c7e16"&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the medication has to be administered within six days of exposure to be effective, leaving officials in a race against time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bear River Health Director Jordan Mathis told local media: 'We had until Sunday to get all those individuals and get them treatment. We definitely had to figure things out on the fly.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the infants' families were notified of the exposure by Friday, September 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Officials in Utah raced to treat nearly a dozen infants infected with measles, which causes a signature rash. In severe cases, it leads to pneumonia, seizures and death (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bear River health officials rushed to set up a clinic on Saturday, September 20, and nine out of the 11 families accepted PEP treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mathis told the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/24/nearly-dozen-utah-babies-exposed/"&gt;Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt; that the other two infants were referred to an emergency room to receive the treatment through an IV due to their small size.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I view it as a great flow of communication, collaboration in order to help hopefully reduce the spread of the disease in our community.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No details were released about the infected patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is an ongoing outbreak of measles in Utah, with 44 people sickened by the virus in 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And nationally, there is a larger outbreak that has totaled 1,514 cases across 42 states so far in 2025. About 12 percent of patients infected have been hospitalized, the latest CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (803) of cases have been in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-17b2dae0-9ade-11f0-9a6c-17cc9a9c7e16"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-17b17b50-9ade-11f0-9a6c-17cc9a9c7e16"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has reported 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three people, including one in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-17b1c970-9ade-11f0-9a6c-17cc9a9c7e16"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and two children in Texas, have died this year from the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the largest outbreak since 2,126 cases were reported in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the number of reported measles cases in Utah so far in 2025. The majority are concentrated in the southwest area of the state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Falling vaccination rates accelerate measles’ return. Just a five percent drop halves the time until endemic spread, while 10 percent+ declines push the US toward outbreaks within years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is an infectious, but preventable, disease caused by a virus that leads to flu-like symptoms, a rash that starts on the face and spreads down the body, and, in severe cases, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-f7dd5c60-8e51-11f0-a9b3-618ddb70db89"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, seizures, brain inflammation, permanent brain damage, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus is spread through direct contact with infectious droplets or through the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with a measles infection are contagious from four days before the rash through four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583809/rfk-jr-u-turn-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-milestone.html"&gt;who are not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; have a 90 percent chance of getting sick if they are exposed, even from sharing the same air, briefly or hours later, with someone who has measles. Three in 1,000 people who contract measles will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths typically occur from acute encephalitis, or brain swelling, when the virus travels to the central nervous system, or pneumonia if it migrates to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before the current two-dose childhood vaccine’s approval in 1968, there were up to 500 US deaths each year from measles, 48,000 hospitalizations and 1,000 cases of brain swelling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly three million to four million people were infected every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The US has reported more than 1,500 measles cases in 2025, the highest tally since the disease was declared 'eliminated' in 2000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC map shows MMR vaccination rates among kindergarteners in each state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first dose of the MMR is given to children at 12 to 15 months, and the second is available to children between the ages of four and six years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A vaccination rate of 95 percent is needed to achieve herd immunity. But nationwide, only 92.5 percent of kindergarteners have gotten both doses of the shot, posing a threat to herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in Utah, the MMR vaccination rate for kindergarteners is just 89 percent. Additionally, nearly one in 10 Utah kindergarteners had a personal, religious or medical exemption for at least one vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 97 percent effective in preventing infection for those who receive both disease, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mathis said the 11 babies who received post-exposure treatment will now be on a delayed MMR vaccine schedule.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:34:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>引发恐慌的谣言在法国大革命之前疯传-《华尔街日报》</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/science/french-revolution-economic-fears-epidemiology-53285662</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOc3JJTFVTUmhINXVEX1J4S1R4aWJDTVlDOWVoLVRTQUd6Q1ltTEc5THBOUG1INnlzS29FMWVoMEkyRUxSRXFPWHFLZjlFNUh3aWZZbW5uN2p0TGtGbXpEbUJ5QXQ2TjREaU8yTkFPNlhubVdVY2R2U1JsRDhKOXRxTTFCbUxibTlDR1E</guid></item><item><title>她是世界上最年长的人，活到117岁。她的基因揭示了长寿的秘密是什么？ - CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/health/maria-branyas-morera-study-genes-intl-scli-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            But what if their secret could be studied scientifically? What could their genome tell us about ageing and why they avoid the diseases that claim so many other people? If any secrets were uncovered, might they, perhaps, help others to live as long, too?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv0005356n398rrtwy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Questions like these are at the heart of a recent paper, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which investigated the genome of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/20/europe/maria-branyas-death-scli-intl"&gt;Maria Branyas Morera&lt;/a&gt;, a US-born Spanish woman who died in August 2024 at age 117 years and 168 days, shortly after becoming the world’s oldest living person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv0006356nmby61fn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She was a very generous person, trying to help, so it was great to work with her,” Dr. Manel Esteller, a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, who co-authored the study, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv0007356nw76cxmm6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Esteller and the research team took samples from Branyas’ blood, saliva, urine and stool before examining her genome and comparing it with those belonging to 75 other Iberian women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv0008356nvc21235x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, they concluded, Branyas lived so long because she both won the genetic lottery and lived a healthy lifestyle. She both possessed genes that guarded against common age-related diseases and followed a healthy lifestyle and diet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000a356nli0mtu0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She was a lucky person from the start, and she got an extra plus through her life,” said Esteller, attributing about half of Branyas’ longevity to her genetics and about half to her lifestyle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000b356nlr5f8nck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She never smoked, she never drank alcohol, she liked to work until she could (not) … She lived in the countryside, she did moderated exercise (mostly walking one hour a day) … She had a diet that included olive oil, Mediterranean style and, in her case, yogurt,” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000c356nlymadinn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If there were one slightly unusual thing about Branyas’ lifestyle, it might be her consumption of yogurt, as she ate three servings a day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000d356nptcgvtp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers hypothesized that, along with the rest of her diet, this habit kept her gut microbiome resembling that of a much younger person and reduced her levels of inflammation. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000e356n8bu2tz4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, Branyas’ love of yoghurt didn’t necessarily caused her “overall fitness” and her gut microbiome is “probably reflecting she’s actually a very good host to all those microbes because of all the other factors that are good about her body,” said Claire Steves, a professor of aging at King’s College London, who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000f356nd5xw8lyp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aside from eating lots of yogurt, Branyas possessed various variations of genes that helped her age healthily. Some of those that the research team identified included a gene associated with immune function and cognitive retention, a gene that influences how efficiently the body metabolizes fats, and another gene associated with aging brain health and heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000g356ndxf0l0zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The level of detail in this paper is extraordinary,” Steves told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “They have gone very deep and managed to assess a wide range of different biological aging mechanisms … To my note, this is the first paper that’s every really done this in this detail,” she said, adding that future studies should see whether the findings are replicated in other supercentenarians.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000i356ncqrupzyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steves, like the researchers themselves, cautioned against drawing broad conclusions from this study, which focuses on just one person, since the aging process is different for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000j356n7iyqpzsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you’re only looking at one person, you can’t be sure whether or not what you’re seeing is because of just fluke, you can’t be sure that the relationship is really clear,” Steves said, though she added that focusing on one person can still offer some insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For example, by examining Branyas’ genome, the research team were able to illustrate that “extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked,” as they said in their study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000l356n2w794yhp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Ill-health in age is not inevitable. It comes about because of biological mechanisms … it’s something we can change,” said Steves, adding that the paper shows “it’s not going to be one single bullet, it’s got to be multiple different pathways.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg0nvgtv000m356nsjkf7690@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And by identifying the genes and proteins involved in healthy aging, Esteller hopes researchers can guide the development of drugs that can target these specific elements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Our aim should not necessarily be to all live to 117,” Steves added. “What we want to do is to try and squash the time when we’re unwell and suffering to as small as possible. And that’s what this lady seems to have done, as well as living to a long time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Whole grains are packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which slow digestion and prevent sharp spikes in blood sugar after meals. On the contrary, refined grains, like white bread and rice, lack nutrients and fiber and thus cause rapid glucose spikes, stressing the body’s insulin response. Over time, this also improves important long-term markers like HbA1c, helping maintain healthier glucose levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 12:33:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8wFBVV95cUxOR25lQ3g5TUY2Y2RLVUlmNFlrRE1FTGN5WXk2MnFNOEl5bXFTNmsxLXJvcTdiNDF0NHVYT0ozSndON2w3RnVnV042V29aRkhuTDVaSkp2MlBJai1ETzkybXRmTzJINGRWbFRTQTVodkJSUWx3eEdwdlVNWTJFa1R6TnlLWUdUZVprM1huVzAwcV94dnp3OURtOW40djNrTzRMUmpDRWlxZGZEZFNPMFJTR3kyMkR1U3FVb2VoSW1QOW9mYVY1eHNxY2VuWk44Wk9uRkJhazhfV1Z0UXZGSmpyN1UwT2RjZnQ5V0VKYk9mMVFDdm_SAfsBQVVfeXFMT1RaNjNfeE9WR1J6Q2toUlhUR1AxZGYzdTFzZ1Blb1c1NUpTbTQ1WVR1WEFaWncwVWYxOTRHRDZTbF9vTk5YTzBsZHE0elpKZGFTTE1hdHBBdzBQakdvMG9iQ2h2MlJkeUtwbVIxRFZOb2lMQjNnbkZ2ejlFNENpS01MZ2tUdkk0RlBMTWhZaDh2NldkRnZOQnFHRktuX25abDk3VFVUNlNjSTFTR3JWdnJESURkZlZIMzkydmVLc3FjbUNkbVJ6ZHFFREdmeElMaVcxb05MNEc1T1g0QUFsQzdHMnJYbERqbG9QR0JfcEZFWnVnRDE5LXVDRUk</guid></item><item><title>官员警告称，促使新冠肺炎疫情在中国受到限制的病毒现已在美国流行--《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15136759/chikungunya-virus-China-circulating-US.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deadly mosquito-borne virus that prompted quarantines and restrictions in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-412699a0-9acc-11f0-9097-57eac862fc79"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; this summer has been detected in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York health officials reported that a woman from Long Island was diagnosed with chikungunya virus in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she hadn't traveled off the island, home to more than 8 million people and the celebrity-loved Hamptons, and now officials fear her case could be the first locally acquired case of chikungunya ever reported in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya virus is spread by mosquitoes and can cause sudden, agonizing joint pain in the hands and feet that can be so severe it leaves sufferers unable to move normally for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the beginning of 2025, more than 317,000 chikungunya cases and 135 chikungunya-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-032d50c0-9acd-11f0-9097-57eac862fc79"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A severe outbreak of the virus in China totaling more than 10,000 cases prompted the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15061875/cdc-travel-advisory-chikungunya-virus-china-usa.html"&gt;CDC to issue a level 2 travel warning&lt;/a&gt; for the Guangdong Province, the epicenter, in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The spread of the mosquito-borne disease triggered a roll out of Covid-like restrictions in China, with patients quarantined in hospitals and electricity cut off to residents who did not follow government health protocols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya is a 'nationally notifiable' condition in the US, meaning health authorities can voluntarily report cases to the agency for national tracking and monitoring. While a handful of cases pop up in the US every year from people traveling to high-risk areas, America hasn't experienced local transmission since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A worker sprays insecticide at a public housing estate following reports of imported cases of Chikungunya virus in Hong Kong, China, in August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The virus has been detected in a woman who lives on Long Island, New York, home to 8 million people and the celebrity-loved Hamptons (file photo above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But with more than 4.7 million US passengers flying internationally on any given day, mosquitoes in America could bite an infected traveler and begin transmitting the virus locally to Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A New York Health Department of Health spokesperson &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntd.com/first-possible-local-chikungunya-case-reported-in-new-york-state-history_1092862.html"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;NTD News: 'The New York State Department of Health is investigating a possible locally acquired case of chikungunya virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No locally acquired cases have ever been reported in New York State, and the risk to the public remains very low.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The department is working with local Long Island health authorities to confirm the patient's test results. Local mosquito surveillance has not detected chikungunya virus in local insect populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chikungunya virus is spread primarily by the Aedes mosquito species and nearly half a million people became infected between 2004 and 2005, leading to a worldwide epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diana Rojas Alvarez, a medical officer at the World Health Organization said this summer of the new cases: 'We are seeing history repeating itself,' referencing the 2004-2005 epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya infections are most common in Asia, Africa and South America, though more recently cases have also emerged across Europe and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The virus can cause symptoms like fever, joint pain and life-threatening complications related to the heart and brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A worker sprays against mosquitoes at night in a park in France to combat the spread of chikungunya virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the 12-month chikungunya virus case notification rate per 100,000 people from September 2024 to August 2025 (source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 15 to 35 percent of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, the CDC reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incubation period is typically three to seven days, and the most common symptom is a sudden onset of a fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are rare, but can occur in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection does not spread from person to person through bodily contact or saliva and can only be transmitted through a bite from an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since there is no specific medical treatment for the chikungunya infections, though certain therapies are used to manage symptoms and any lasting complications, experts ask people to regularly use insect repellents and wear long-sleeve clothing to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two vaccines available for chikungunya virus, but they are not routine and only recommended for people visiting areas with an outbreak or that may pose a higher risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Discover why they should be avoided and which healthy practices you should turn to instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-895edf" class="body-graf"&gt;The promise of frizz-free hair is a tempting one. From smoothing balms to humidity-fighting sprays, there’s a seemingly endless supply of products that promise to do the trick — some more potent than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a81a0" class="body-graf"&gt;One in particular, the keratin treatment, also known as a Brazilian blowout or Brazilian keratin treatment, delivers sleek and shiny strands by coating the hair shaft and sealing it with heat. While its results can last for months, getting a keratin treatment while trying to conceive can be risky, &lt;a href="https://theluckyegg.com/about-me/"&gt;Dr. Lucky Sekhon&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified OBGYN, endocrinologist and infertility specialist, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f5755e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Many chemicals in (some of) these treatments, including formaldehyde, are used to open the outer cuticle and penetrate hair better,” she explains. Research has linked the chemicals found in some keratin treatments to pregnancy complications and adverse health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-695846" class="body-graf"&gt;Research is still ongoing, Sekhon points out, but she wants those in the process of conceiving to be as healthy as possible. “There’s something to be said about reducing unnecessary exposure,” she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e9de6d" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Have I Ever: Gotten a Keratin Treatment While Trying to Get Pregnant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd14d0" class="body-graf"&gt;She’ll admit it. Sekhon has gotten a keratin treatment before and embraced the results, but she wasn’t trying to get pregnant and wouldn’t advise any of her patients in the process of conceiving to get one. (She also recommends avoiding it if you're pregnant or breastfeeding).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-114f44" class="body-graf"&gt;As you may know, everyone already has keratin in their hair. It’s a protein essential to forming and protecting our hair’s strands, our nails and our skin. As we age, expose our hair to the elements, including the sun, do our hair in tight styles, and use dyes and texturizers, the keratin starts to deplete, making hair look duller and, oftentimes, frizzier. Keratin treatments replenish the lost keratin by restoring the proteins, preserving the hair’s bonds, resulting in a sleek look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a0a6f6" class="body-graf"&gt;The issue is that once the keratin treatment has been applied to wet hair, you must apply heat in order for it to penetrate the hair shaft and cure. “When the solution is heated, the formaldehyde in the products is released into the air as a gas. If the salon is not properly ventilated, both the salon professionals and their clients are at risk of inhaling the released formaldehyde,” the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-smoothing-products-release-formaldehyde-when-heated"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-4591f3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6bab35" class="body-graf"&gt;Formaldehyde, sometimes listed as formalin and methylene glycol, is a strong-smelling, colorless gas that can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, wheezing, nausea and skin irritation, says the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b78a9a" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s in most things you already use, including cosmetics, disinfectants, paper products, adhesives and building materials, among other things, but at a certain concentration, formaldehyde can be dangerous. A number of studies have linked exposure to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8042688/#Sec7"&gt;formaldehyde to certain cancers&lt;/a&gt; in both animals and people, and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ckj/article/14/5/1469/6078576"&gt;kidney injuries,&lt;/a&gt; Sekhon points out, even from keratin treatments branded as formaldehyde-free. They'll sometimes still have low levels of the chemical mixed in or other harmful preservatives in place of formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a9de5" class="body-graf"&gt;Those who work with formaldehyde in high concentrations, including lab workers and hair stylists, are the most susceptible to increased chances of fertility difficulties and miscarriage, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/reproductive-health/prevention/formaldehyde.html"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-78efe1" class="body-graf"&gt;While research is still underway, “current exposure limits were written for healthy non-pregnant workers and might not protect a developing fetus,” the CDC notes, so Sekhon says to err on the side of caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3f6f04" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1a24e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Rather than opting for a keratin treatment, “keep things as simple as you possibly can during that time frame,” recommends Sekhon. Wash and condition your hair regularly without unnecessary chemicals from dyes and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea51b7" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re trying to conceive and you’ve already gotten the treatment, don’t worry, says Sekhon. Reduce your exposure by applying less heat to your hair so that the chemical won’t aerate in your home. She also recommends sleeping with a fresh towel on your pillow every night and washing your hands after touching your hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ebec0" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“You can’t live in a bubble,” Sekhon recognizes, “but I think that there are some things that you can temporarily give up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOTDdUOHBvbWtYQXN5Y3hwcDRxMXl3TW4zTFcxSnc5V3lEeFM1dVlsVU5qNTZ5V2NWdDVXdVl1NzRwelBGdnhhUHR5VGV1ZjVma1RyYjlZNllsLW04WGdzaGtma2lYendDd3RPbHFvcktMS044cm5haW5fcWVZOWdfUmpPSXZQSWlIb0k3UXN6WXJpaGJIWVZsbjVvSUFGTkk2ZWgwVkdRa0NpMjQ30gFUQVVfeXFMTllJZkJHTWpnaldDSVkxRnh5cFI5cC0zNkhISTU2VUxXTERqdGxJSlY5Qi1aOVpzTGptZ0ZfdnYzeUZ3N19PN0o1YnIwTl9kOUNnTjEw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，美国大多数儿童枪支自杀事件都是用父母的枪支完成的- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/health/child-firearm-suicides-parents-guns-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Suicide is a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816956" target="_blank"&gt;top cause of death&lt;/a&gt; among adolescents in the United States — second for children ages 10 to 14 and third among those 15 to 19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These adolescents most often use firearms to end their lives. For kids ages 10 to 17, the guns are 10 times more likely to be owned by parents who store them unlocked and loaded, according to new research that lead author Dr. Sofia Chaudhary is presenting Sunday at the American Academy of Pediatrics 2025 National Conference and Exhibition in Denver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000h3b6nfo0n7w5d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research hasn’t been peer-reviewed but is consistent with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2816956" target="_blank"&gt;previous studies showing&lt;/a&gt; the well-established relationship between home firearms and suicide, said Dr. Rebecca Berry, a clinical psychologist in private practice in New York City and Westchester County, New York, via email.

            “We have been seeing an increasing number of children and teens that have been presenting to pediatric emergency departments across the country with suicidal thoughts and attempts,” said Chaudhary, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000j3b6nb6nps70z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prevalence of firearms as the method of choice among children attempting suicide “is frightening,” she added, “because we know that when a firearm is used in suicide, it is fatal 90% of the time, and that most of these children do not get a second chance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000k3b6n6xkmlpvc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers wanted to examine the circumstances surrounding those episodes to identify solutions for preventing such deaths, said Chaudhary, who is also an assistant professor in pediatrics and emergency medicine  at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000l3b6ndtuaacvv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research findings derive from 1,021 firearm suicides reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nvdrs/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Violent Death Reporting System&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 to 2021. The young people were between ages 10 and 24 and had lived in Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire and North Dakota.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000m3b6naixucn26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reporting system, though not frequently used in research , is “our richest data source related to suicide decedents and the factors going on preceding their death,” said Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the &lt;a href="https://afsp.org/firearms-and-suicide-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, who wasn’t involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000n3b6ni7l5dx4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ninety percent  of the suicides were by males, and of the overall suicides, 82% were by White youth, 63% were among people ages 20 to 24 and 69% occurred in a house or apartment, the researchers found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000o3b6napywruat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Details on firearm ownership were missing for 23% of the decedents. But 4% of those ages 10 to 17 owned the guns they used, compared with 53% of 18- to 24-year-olds. Of the 30% of the decedents who had known mental health problems , 60% of them owned their firearms, and 25% used guns that belonged to a parent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000p3b6nogh38zg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data on storage factors were limited, but the available data showed that firearms were significantly more likely to be stored unlocked and loaded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000q3b6nz0f204ws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Research on firearms and the association with youth injury and death is critically important, and in prior years (it) has been hard to advance the science due to funding barriers,” said Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, via email. She wasn’t involved in the research. “If parents are gun owners, they need to be aware of this data and store their gun appropriately.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000r3b6nfyyzzy44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, or AAP, advises that to prevent firearm-related injuries and deaths, the safest home for a child is one without guns. In 2020, firearms became the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/guns-death-us-children-teens-dg"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; among children ages 1 to 18.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000s3b6ntdqi9hb8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who own a gun, improving storage methods can start with considering how you plan to use the gun and, accordingly, whether it should be kept in your home, said Heard-Garris, also a pediatrician at the Ann &amp;amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. Owning firearms for hunting, for example, is good cause for storing firearms outside the home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000t3b6nt95vtlz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Guns and ammunition shouldn’t be kept in your car regardless of whether they’re locked and unloade  d, the AAP says. Some states have laws that require &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/gun-ownership-in-massachusetts" target="_blank"&gt;safe storage of guns at all times&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/rpt/2013-R-0001.htm" target="_blank"&gt;certain circumstances&lt;/a&gt;, such as living with someone under age 16 or someone who isn’t legally allowed to own or possess a gun.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000u3b6nzxojqjfl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For indoor storage, guns should be kept unloaded and locked in appropriate safes or lockboxes for handguns, with ammunition in a separate safe, the AAP recommends. Access codes, combinations or key locations should be kept preferably in only gun owners’ memories   or somewhere else others can’t find them. Many parents and caregivers think their kids don’t know where their guns are stored, but &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777216" target="_blank"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; most kids are aware of those hiding places.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000v3b6n2nystjmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Concerns that safe storage renders guns insufficiently accessible during emergencies is valid, experts told CNN in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/09/health/gun-safety-tips-for-home-parents-children-wellness"&gt;a 2021 report&lt;/a&gt;. But there is a substantial difference between the likelihood of that situation and that of gun use in accidental or purposeful harm, Moutier said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000w3b6nr8zexdub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One option, however, is a quick-access safe that can be bolted down. Some of these have fingerprint security for instant unlocking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000x3b6nrda8vopt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the event of mental health concerns or crises, firearms — in appropriate conditions and storage containers — should be &lt;a href="https://lock2live.org/" target="_blank"&gt;temporarily left off-site&lt;/a&gt; with a trusted adult, law enforcement office or shooting range, Chaudhary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000y3b6n5822ot3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding access to guns outside the home, “ask parents before your child has sleepovers, play dates, and hangouts if the family owns a gun, and if so, how they store it,” Heard-Garris said via email. If the family isn’t willing to answer or adjust, suggest their kids come to your house instead, experts recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv000z3b6nlppew95u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Creating a safe environment for young people concerns not only promoting gun safety but also providing the emotional safety that can help you &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/how-to-help-kids-mental-health-wellness"&gt;be more aware&lt;/a&gt; of their well-being before a &lt;a href="https://afsp.org/teens-and-suicide-what-parents-should-know/" target="_blank"&gt;potential suicide attempt&lt;/a&gt; — though individuals cannot always predict or prevent someone’s suicide attempt.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00113b6ndt33jde5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many parents tend to think their child would never do something as severe as attempting suicide, even when they’re aware of their child’s stressors. But they could be wrong.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00123b6nul3hcldu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Parents can’t be in a bubble of denial about their own kid’s potential suffering,” Moutier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00133b6n312xgjfg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consider how much you hid from your parents at your child’s age — and that “youth oftentimes suffer in silence for long periods where they’re not sure if telling someone else about their struggles is safe to do,” she noted. “When they do, the majority of the time, they will tell a peer before they will tell a parent.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00143b6n2vf8rhfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a pervasive level of mental health crisis among young people,” Moutier added . “Of the 1 in 4 Americans who will develop a mental health condition in their lifetime, 50% have their onset of that mental health condition by age 14 and 75% by age 24.” But some people who attempt suicide do so impulsively or don’t have a mental health condition, Chaudhary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00153b6nkkofiy3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Expand your interactions with your child beyond asking about lunch, homework or sports.   Inquire about how they have been feeling or what has been on their mind lately during casual, relaxed everyday activities, experts suggested. Being less direct and formal can help prevent your kid putting a wall up — as can chatting during car rides since not being face-to-face can feel less intimidating for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00163b6n38jhzhpj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Notice when they happen to open up about their world and take advantage of those moments, Moutier said. Even if you’re anxious about or baffled by what they’re saying, don’t interrogate or criticize them, jump to conclusions or give unsolicited advice, Chaudhary said. Instead, validate, empathize with and be curious about their feelings and perceptions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00173b6n09ndt628@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Try to convey warm and accepting facial expressions as well,” Berry said, “as teens especially can be sensitive to perceived slights from parents.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00183b6nnuw1hr5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Berry also  recommends parents and children practice healthy coping skills, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness"&gt;progressive muscle relaxation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/health/start-a-journal-diary-wellness-wisdom-project"&gt;journaling&lt;/a&gt;, together.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv00193b6n1hqbcmsp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Respect when your child isn’t ready to discuss something and say you’re available when they’re ready, Chaudhary said. But consider getting professional help if you notice changes in school performance, diet, sleep, mood, energy and engagement with friends or activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv001a3b6nm800bh07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How you discuss and manage the mental health of yourself and others is critical for your child’s perceptions of you as a safe, helpful confidant and of their own struggles and how they should handle them, experts said. In fact, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2838790" target="_blank"&gt;new research shows&lt;/a&gt; that children with parents who have experienced substance use disorder, suicidal behavior or alcohol-related disease are 67%   more likely to later attempt suicide or engage in other self-harm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg01b1tv001b3b6nffs3pnjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Don’t call people “crazy” or say you’re powering through a rough period in front of your children. Have compassion for yourself and others and mention when you have sought a loved one’s help or attended therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

But in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/influencers-all-meat-carnivore-diets-reasons-risks.html"&gt;the carnivore diet&lt;/a&gt; and endless &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/whats-going-on-with-cottage-cheese-tiktok-recipe-trend.html"&gt;cottage-cheese recipes&lt;/a&gt;, a new macro is starting to get more airtime. “Respectfully, you should be trying harder to hit your fiber target, not your protein target,” warned one &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alicebleathman_/video/7474852169817033990"&gt;viral TikTok&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Soon, people on the app were talking about “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/style/fibermaxxing-tiktok-trend.html"&gt;fibermaxxing&lt;/a&gt;,” and influencers started gushing about the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@impamibaby/video/7504364322739539230?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121749182%2C121433650%2C121404359%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121811500%2C121860360%2C121487028%2C121679410%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121885509%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;amp;refer=embed&amp;amp;referer_url=www.nytimes.com%2F2025%2F07%2F08%2Fstyle%2Ffibermaxxing-tiktok-trend.html&amp;amp;referer_video_id=7504364322739539230"&gt;chia-seed pudding&lt;/a&gt; and sharing tips to get &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dietitian.gabrielle/video/7547778859500899597"&gt;50 grams of fiber a day&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike protein, fiber is the macronutrient the vast majority of Americans actually don’t eat enough of. Women generally need &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/"&gt;about 25 grams a day,&lt;/a&gt; but most of us eat &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/"&gt;around half that much&lt;/a&gt;. TikTok says prioritizing fiber will keep you &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@plantyou/video/7483624031367843127?q=fiber&amp;amp;t=1758652482505"&gt;full longer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alanlinplus/video/7517851995055672590?q=fiber&amp;amp;t=1758652482505"&gt;snatch your waist&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dietitian.gabrielle/video/7496649719360376106"&gt;reduce your risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

She’d been running the business for more than 15 years, but increasingly, she was feeling lost and exhausted. She started going for long walks, hiking near the Appalachian Mountains outside of her hometown of Columbus, Ohio, and eating tons of blueberries. “Like, a quart a day,” she says. She quickly noticed that she felt better than usual — radically better. She suddenly had more energy; for the first time in her life, she started running in the woods. She dropped 20 pounds without much effort. Her skin looked better, her face less puffy. “Friends told me I was reverse aging,” says Britton, who is 52. “I just started to feel alive again,” she says. Her husband — with whom she shares two teenage children — is a “wonderful human being,” but they’d grown apart over the years. Eating more fiber helped her feel like herself again, and she realized it was time to make some big changes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnmps000g3b78bqlu45a2@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;The way Britton tells it, she accidentally stumbled on the secret to health and well-being. Nourishing her gut microbiome with plants helped her think more clearly. Eating more fiber would help America, “as a country,” restore its sense of hope, she says. “I know it almost starts to sound woo-woo or like a miracle drug, but …” she pauses, “it kind of is.” She decided it was time to step away from her career in ice cream and leave Ohio for New York. In January, she launched &lt;a href="https://www.floura.com/"&gt;Floura&lt;/a&gt;, a line of fruit bars in flavors like “blueberry matcha” and “mango cardamom” that promise half your daily fiber. The first batch sold out in two days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnmso000h3b78mul3b69y@published" data-word-count="90"&gt;The bars are made from “upcycled fruit” — leftover trimmings from a produce-processing plant in New Jersey that supplies fresh-cut fruit for stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. Each bar contains 12 different plants, including fermented watermelon rinds, apple paste (made from the cores left over from bags of Mott’s sliced apples, “like the ones they use in Happy Meals,” Britton says), almonds, puffed quinoa,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and chicory root. As far as bars go, they actually taste pretty good — somewhere between a fruit leather and the inside of a Fig Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnmw3000i3b78np5rcqjf@published" data-word-count="182"&gt;When I visit Britton’s apartment, which she’s subletting from a friend on the Lower East Side, she starts cutting up an Asian pear and loading the pieces into a small blue plastic chopper. “I dated a guy in Berlin who turned me on to this little chopper, and now I use it all the time,” she says. Most days, her first meal of the day is a bowl of bircher muesli, which she makes with sheep’s-milk yogurt mixed with oats, flax, chia seeds, grated apples and pears, walnuts, pepitas, coconut, cardamom, and a few slices of underripe banana (“When it’s still a little green, it has more fiber,” she says). It’s a recipe she created with her gut microbiome in mind. “I went on ChatGPT and I asked it to tell me every single fiber that I’m using, and which specific microbes it’s feeding, because there are so many different ones, and they can affect your brain activity, or energy, hormones, skin … even things like optimism and hope.” For optimal gut health, she tries to eat 30 different plants a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnn09000j3b78u6p6ekw4@published" data-word-count="230"&gt;“I’m not a health nut by any means,” Britton says. “I don’t work out. I don’t go to the gym.” She’s skeptical of supplements, though she recently started taking vitamin D after “reading some studies.” She doesn’t track macros, and she still eats a lot of ice cream — her favorite Jeni’s flavor is Buttercream Birthday Cake. But she’s convinced that fiber deficiency is the root of many of our problems. “Our mission is really to reverse chronic illnesses,” she says. Though she thinks MAHA’s &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL5kKtxxj2_/?hl=en"&gt;focus on food dyes&lt;/a&gt; is misguided, she agrees that a reckoning with the “industrial food system” is long overdue. Floura’s ads play up the fact that they’re seed-oil free. “There’s so much science that’s already out there,” she says, before explaining that she thinks that her microbiome being out of balance could have caused her children’s autism. &lt;em&gt;Really?&lt;/em&gt; I ask. “I was working too much, eating too much sugar,” she says. “I do think there was something …” she trails off. “I don’t know. It could also be genetic.” (While &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821339"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, and whole grains in pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of autism spectrum disorders, there is no definitive evidence that a mother’s diet causes autism, which experts believe is typically the result of a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnn1t000k3b78dzt76lwk@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;When many people think of fiber, they think of Metamucil, which, as a gloopy powder mixed with water to help keep you regular, is probably the most unsexy supplement on the market. Britton says that Gen Z doesn’t have the same baggage. While she initially assumed Floura’s customer base would be the menopause crowd, so far, its fans have skewed younger. From talking with her 18-year-old daughter, Britton has gleaned that today’s young people are “obsessed with bloating and pooping.” She predicts that grocery stores will soon be full of fiber-enhanced products, like &lt;a href="https://drinkolipop.com/blogs/digest/what-is-prebiotic-fiber-benefits-uses#:~:text=OLIPOP%20is%20different.,health%20and%20a%20healthy%20microbiome."&gt;Olipop&lt;/a&gt; and a “daily fiber veggie pouch” known as &lt;a href="https://www.drinkliquidplus.com/"&gt;Liquid Salad&lt;/a&gt;. “All the VCs are very interested,” she says. “It’s definitely taking off.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnn3b000l3b78vpsj92xl@published" data-word-count="163"&gt;The hype around fiber sometimes seems too good to be true — but the dietitians I spoke with generally agreed that, if you haven’t been eating enough, adding more plants to your diet will help you feel better. “I kind of love that fiber hired protein’s PR team,” says Clara Nosek, a registered dietitian-nutritionist who runs the Instagram account &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourdietitianbff/?hl=en"&gt;@yourdietianbff&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to making it easier to poop, fiber also slows down digestion of carbs, helping to regulate blood sugar, Nosek says. It can help lower cholesterol, and eating enough really can reduce &lt;a href="http://nytimes.com/2025/08/02/well/how-your-diet-influences-your-colorectal-cancer-risk.html"&gt;your risk of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;. There’s some truth to the idea that eating more fiber can help with cravings and food noise, too. “A really big benefit of fiber is increasing satiety and fullness,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/fork.diet.culture/"&gt;Abbey Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. “It can help so we’re not feeling like we’re constantly looking for the next thing to eat, and always feeling the need to snack, which can happen with a low-fiber diet.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnn5g000m3b78h8meglu7@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;But there’s a reason the majority of us struggle to get enough fiber. Eating a diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains requires time and money, and at $33 for a box of ten, Floura bars aren’t cheap. There’s also no getting around the fact that it’s a processed food. Britton pushes back on this: “There’s no ultraprocessed anything in Floura. We’re sticklers on that,” she says. “Everything in this is made the way your great-great-great-grandmother would have made it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmfztnn76000n3b789sw3e4cn@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;When I ask Britton if she eats a Floura bar every day, she shakes her head. “I eat this,” she says, gesturing to her muesli. “I get enough fiber. But I tell everybody,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;‘If you can’t get enough fiber, eat a Floura bar.’”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="drop_cap"&gt;Travel comes with great reward, and also risk. &lt;span&gt;Some threats are a minor nuisance—a painful sunburn, a canceled flight—while others are serious, even deadly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In March of 2025, Miller Gardner, the 14-year-old son of former New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/miller-gardner-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-possible-cause-of-death/"&gt;died in Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; while vacationing with his family. Authorities say carbon monoxide poisoning was responsible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A month earlier, three &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/belize-american-women-died-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/"&gt;American women died&lt;/a&gt; of suspected carbon monoxide poisoning in their hotel room in Belize. And according to a report by &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;, since 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/airbnb-carbon-monoxide-poisonings-detectors-rcna105634"&gt;19 people have died&lt;/a&gt; as a result of alleged carbon monoxide poisoning while staying in Airbnb vacation rentals abroad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Over the past several years, we’ve seen far too many heartbreaking stories in the headlines – families falling ill, and in some tragic cases, losing their lives while staying in hotels, vacation rentals, or other temporary accommodations,” said Isis Wu, president of the fire safety company, Kidde. “Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is often to blame, and it’s called the invisible or silent killer for good reason. You can’t see it, smell it, or taste it, but it can strike anyone, anywhere, without warning.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Carbon Monoxide Poisoning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/carbon-monoxide/about/index.html"&gt;Carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; is an odorless, colorless, tasteless gas that can be emitted from gas and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and grills, causing symptoms like headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, confusion, flu-like illness, and even death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/carbon-monoxide/about/index.html"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) estimates over 400 Americans die annually from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, and more than 100,000 people go to the emergency room as a result. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="video-inline"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.firstalert.com/blogs/safety-corner/carbon-monoxide-legislation"&gt;48 states&lt;/a&gt; require carbon monoxide detectors in residences, but in hotels and motels, more specifically, only&lt;a href="https://www.ecmag.com/magazine/articles/article-detail/carbon-monoxide-detection-follow-state-regulations-and-codes-for-proper-installation"&gt; 14 U.S. states mandate&lt;/a&gt; them. Globally, regulations &lt;a href="https://cr.usembassy.gov/health-alert-carbon-monoxide-risk"&gt;vary widely by country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text-center banner"&gt;&lt;dfp-slot id="div-gpt-ad-986129" class="mid-ad" ad-type="banner_ad" :ad-unit-index="2"&gt;&lt;/dfp-slot&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While most people think about CO safety at home, the truth is that travelers face heightened risks in hotels, motels, and vacation rentals where regulations on CO alarms are inconsistent,” said Wu. “Simply put: don’t assume safety standards are the same everywhere.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Know About Carbon Monoxide While Traveling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2021 study by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335521002217"&gt;Preventive Medicine Reports&lt;/a&gt; found that between the years of 1999 and 2018, over 3,400 incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning took place in hotels and motels in the United States. However, since no national mandated reporting system exists, those figures could be far higher. The report also only accounts for commercial hotels and motels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for vacation rentals, in a statement to Fodor’s, a spokesperson for Airbnb said, “Carbon monoxide incidents at properties listed on Airbnb are extremely rare worldwide, and we take CO safety very seriously. We urge all hosts to install smoke and CO alarms in spaces that use fuel-burning appliances and run an industry-leading &lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3267/"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; that has given away over 280,000 free combined smoke and CO detectors to our hosts. And if one isn’t mentioned, we notify and encourage guests to bring their own.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while the chance of poisoning is unlikely, it’s not zero.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Incidents are rare but not unheard of,” said Neil Jacobs, founder of Wild Origins, an advisory company working with hospitality clients, and the former CEO of Six Senses Hotels and Resorts. “The overall risk is low, but awareness and simple precautions add peace of mind.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Pick a Portable Carbon Monoxide Detector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts agree, the best way to remove doubt and avoid tragedy safely is to pack a portable carbon monoxide detector—even if lodgings have one in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Carbon monoxide has been blamed for several traveler deaths in the last few years,” said John Gobbels, COO of Medjet, a global air medical transport service aiding travelers experiencing a medical crisis. “Having equipment to detect it could be life-saving. I travel with a small portable one, especially if I’m traveling with my kids.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Travel-friendly carbon monoxide detectors from reputable brands like Kidde or First Alert range in price from around $20 to $30 on Amazon, and experts suggest opting for a battery-operated or battery-backup alarm. That way, you won’t lose coverage in the event of an unexpected power outage. They also encourage consumers to remove the batteries while in transit, and to test the device upon arrival to ensure it works properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text-center banner"&gt;&lt;dfp-slot id="div-gpt-ad-996129" class="mid-ad" ad-type="banner_ad" :ad-unit-index="3"&gt;&lt;/dfp-slot&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Portable detectors provide an extra safeguard anywhere in the world,” Jacobs said, noting that the best portable detectors also have a loud alarm, digital display, peak level memory, battery backup, long sensor life, and an end-of-life warning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, before making any purchase, make sure the monitor is designed in accordance with&lt;a href="https://ulse.org/insight/news-introduction-standards-what-standard-and-why-do-they-matter/"&gt; UL standards&lt;/a&gt;. “The device should meet UL safety standards and be easy to test. Avoid older or non-certified devices that don’t meet recognized standards,” Wu said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety Tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Carbon-Monoxide-Information-Center/CO-Alarms"&gt;U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; recommends placing carbon monoxide alarms on every floor and inside each bedroom . That guidance extends to travel spaces as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One is enough for a standard room; larger suites or villas may need more,” Jacobs said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gobbels also points to potential high-risk locations as strategic placement areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Water heaters and furnaces are prime leak points, so place the detector near the room that contains those items,” he said. “Carbon monoxide is lighter than air and rises when warm, so place the detector on a wall about five feet above the floor. That’s usually about eye level. Wherever you place it, make sure the alarm can be heard from sleeping areas and is loud enough to wake you up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should the monitor sound an alarm, exit the area and request help right away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Never try to tough it out indoors,” Wu warned. “Carbon monoxide is called the invisible killer for a reason. By the time symptoms hit, your body and/or mind may already be impaired.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And remember, carbon monoxide poisoning doesn’t distinguish between lodging types, whether it’s a bare bones cabin or an opulent five-star retreat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even luxury hotels and well-known resorts have experienced serious CO-related incidents,” Wu said. “The risk of carbon monoxide poisoning does not discriminate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This can lead them to pick a treatment that is not effective,” the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC said it is not known specifically why the surge is happening but suspects gaps in infection control such as hand hygiene, wearing gloves and gown during patient care, and proper cleaning and disinfection, and limited testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many hospitals and clinics do not have the tools to rapidly detect NDM-CRE infections or the presence of these dangerous germs in patients who aren’t yet sick,” the CDC said. “Delayed identification leads to slower treatment, increased transmission, and missed opportunities for infection control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SC Department of Health said, “Taking antibiotics when they are not needed or not following prescribed use can lead to increased antibiotic resistance, raising concerns about potential spread of these bacteria in communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most at risk are people in healthcare facilities, especially those who are on ventilators. urinary catheters, or intravenous catheters as well as those who have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is spread by person-to-person contact from dirty hands, wounds, or stool or contaminated medical equipment and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="20" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals can also get CRE but the risk of it being transmitted to pet owners is low, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-16" class="zone-el"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The State</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE90N2ZNRm8xREJmUUJoMElCenNHeVpNQ0poTlAtc0dMRGxBbTZ2V0tWNGlVeXR1aEZfclhnazJDRjBLLXpzUm1xQ1NxNkdITVZ5SXlwVXk1N2ZWZENvT3I2RWJ1ZEdUQjJnTXVHVUpFSmlra1ZtaGFEUENoLXfSAXxBVV95cUxQeGNSaG9OZ2VrZTR6cXpBdlJrUld1UVl3NkJXa1Q3V0tHS0tSLVpyWkNoS0ZOdnl3SG1hWGZBVkpDeWFFenR2c09ibEp3aUU5ckx0c0JlbDVYNy1XY0QtbnYyeTAtVkRCNU1fLXlhYXJEMnRZYkJLa3pmdGVZ</guid></item><item><title>以下是北卡罗来纳州医生说今年秋天拍摄的3张照片（ +何时拍摄） - Charlotte Observer</title><link>https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article312240243.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cooler weather sets in, so does the season for respiratory illnesses – and doctors say the best defense is already within reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina health experts are urging people to roll up their sleeves this fall, with three key shots that can help keep serious illness at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the timing of each dose can make a big difference in how well they work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the vaccines you need to prepare for the respiratory illness season this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Flu vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should get it:&lt;/b&gt; All children and adults six months and older, unless there is a specific medical reason to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you should get it:&lt;/b&gt; In September or October, before flu activity begins to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It takes one to three weeks to develop immunity from a vaccine&lt;/b&gt;, so if you’re going to travel for the holidays later this year, there’s still time to get that vaccine and immunity, Dr. David Weber, an infectious disease specialist at UNC Health, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article297224169.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously told The News &amp;amp; Observer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like mailing your letter to Santa if you want a Christmas present to arrive,” Weber said. “You can’t wait until Christmas Eve to mail it off.

        &lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, kids in America are safer than ever. But apparently, golf carts didn’t get the memo. New research this week finds that pediatric golf cart injuries are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia conducted the study, which analyzed golf cart injuries that sent children and young adults to the emergency room. They found that these injuries had increased in recent years, with almost half involving children under the age of 12. More needs to be done to beat back the golf cart menace, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The growing trend of golf cart use in residential areas, alongside the increased frequency of children driving and riding these vehicles, correlates with a concerning rise in both the number and variety of childhood golf cart injuries,” said study author Theodore Ganley, director of the Sports Medicine and Performance Center at CHOP, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1098920?"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The findings are being presented over the weekend at AAP’s national conference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why and how kids are getting hurt by golf carts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers pored through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a database of injuries treated at hospital emergency departments across the country. The data is intended to be nationally representative, so scientists often use it to gauge how many Americans are hurt by specific products or specific causes of injury.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They examined NEISS data between 2010 and 2023, focusing on golf cart-related injuries among children and young adults (aged 22 and younger). They counted 1,419 cases during that period—amounting to an estimated 53,855 such injuries nationwide during that period. On average, they estimated that around 3,800 golf cart injuries occurred annually, but they also found that these injuries had increased consistently during the past three years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average age of a golf cart victim was 11, and 90% of those hurt were boys. Roughly half of the injuries were caused by someone falling from the cart, while 36% involved a collision or cart overturning. Kids were most often hurt along the head, face, or neck, while half of all injuries were deemed superficial.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Notably, other research has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18541177/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the trend of rising golf cart injuries in general dates back to the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say their findings highlight the “inadequacy of robust safety features and the deficits in standard regulations.” But, leaving aside the possibility of waging a massive public campaign to dissuade kids from golf, that should also mean there’s plenty that can be done to reduce these injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Golf carts could be better designed to handle sharp corners, for instance, or to be less prone to tumbling over in general. Policy and lawmakers could also pass laws and regulations to encourage better safety.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some places have already started to do the latter. Just this year, South Carolina &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kids-sc-wear-seat-belts-100000821.html"&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; a law requiring children under 12 to wear a seat belt when inside these vehicles on public roads. In 2023, Florida also &lt;a href="https://www.motoelectricvehicles.com/blog/new-florida-law-raises-age-for-golf-cart-drivers/"&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; to require that teens have a permit or license to drive a cart (previously, kids as young as 14 could drive without any license at all).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also say that people should be made more aware of the potential dangers of golf carts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the urgent need for increased awareness and attention to these injuries among children and demonstrate the crucial role of education on safe golf cart operation,” Ganley said.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pet videos just make you smile before you even know why. This Instagram Reel is a perfect example of that. Gamja and Chip, two &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; siblings with an endless appetite for silliness, were supposed to be downstairs when their human called for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if you’ve ever shared a home with dogs, you know obedience sometimes takes a back seat to fun. Instead of bounding down the stairs, the duo cooked up their own entertainment — one that looks less like mischief and more like an impromptu comedy routine. It’s pure Golden energy at its finest: goofy, carefree, and entirely on their own schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-owner-proves-how-pup-siblings-brain-cells-are-connected-in-video"&gt;Owner proves how pup siblings’ brain cells are connected in video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clip has already pulled in nearly 12K likes, which makes sense once you see what was happening upstairs. The video starts with their human climbing the stairs, a little puzzled about why the pups were ignoring her calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the top, the mystery unravels. Gamja and Chip can be seen sprawled out on the bedroom’s rug, rolling around like they’d just discovered gravity for the first time. Both were on their backs, paws in the air, legs flailing in a rhythm so uncanny it looked rehearsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Golden Retrievers are often called the clowns of the dog world, and here’s proof. Their wiggly bodies moved in near-synchronization. At one point, they pause dramatically before resuming what looked like a “synchronized derp routine,” as one commenter put it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another laughed at “Gamja’s karate kicks,” while a user said, “Them twinning made my day!” The replies even built on their human’s caption about “connected brain cells,” with one cheeky fan suggesting the pups “lost the brain cell in the carpet and are trying to absorb it back.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes the video of the pups even funnier is how unbothered they are about their owner’s calls. Rolling, kicking, and flopping against each other was clearly more important. The furbabies’ bond is obvious in the clip — not just as siblings, but as partners in perfect nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

They can help to protect neurons — cells that transmit and receive messages to and from other tissues — during seizures and strokes, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21978" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21978" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;they prune unneeded connections between neurons&lt;/a&gt; during normal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microglia do a lot of important things,” says Chris Bennett, a psychiatrist who studies microglia at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “So, it’s not surprising that they are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those diseases include a suite of rare disorders caused by genetic mutations that directly affect microglia. Malfunctioning microglia have also been implicated in more familiar conditions with complex causes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01101-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01101-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson’s disease, as well as ageing, says Bo Peng, a neuroscientist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immune-cell swap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led researchers to investigate a tantalizing possibility: that replacing disease-causing microglia could treat some brain conditions. But swapping out microglia poses special challenges. Physicians typically replace a person’s immune cells by performing a bone-marrow transplant, which provides a fresh supply of stem cells that shelter in the bone marrow and give rise to many immune cells. Microglia, however, reside almost exclusively in the central nervous system, and typically replenish themselves by division rather than relying on stem cells in the bone marrow to send in replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03931-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03008-5/d41586-025-03008-5_27185970.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How CRISPR gene editing could help treat Alzheimer’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians already use bone-marrow transplants to treat some rare diseases that affect microglia, such as a condition called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The treatment can be effective, says Marco Prinz, a neuropathologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, but the results are inconsistent and typically replace only a small percentage of the recipient’s natural microglia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Peng’s team used bone-marrow transplants to replace abnormal microglia resulting from a fatal brain disease called CAMP (CSF1R-associated microgliopathy). The treatment was a success in both mice and in a small trial of eight people with the rare disorder: none of the eight participants experienced a decline in their motor or cognitive abilities in two years following the treatment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas members of a control group who did not receive the procedure experienced a deterioration of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason for the success of the CAMP trial is the nature of the disease itself, says Bennett, because people with CAMP tend to produce relatively few microglia. This could leave space for the transplanted cells to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Onerous regimen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating that niche for the new microglia is a pivotal step in microglia replacement — and a source of concern. To make room for transplanted cells, physicians must first wipe out as many of the brain’s resident microglia as possible. This can entail high levels of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both of which can leave the recipient vulnerable to infection during the procedure and raise their long-term risk of cancer. That means that microglia replacement is, for the moment, too toxic to be used except in severe, rapidly progressing diseases such as CAMP, says Colella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If left unchecked, it significantly increases the risk of heart attacks, stroke, and other life-threatening cardiovascular complications. While statins are a widely prescribed and effective medication for managing cholesterol, cardiologists emphasize that certain natural foods can also help lower LDL cholesterol levels and promote long-term heart health through diet and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation, incorporating oats and foods fortified with plant sterols and stanols into your daily diet can significantly reduce bad cholesterol and offer heart-protective benefits comparable to statins when consumed consistently and in appropriate amounts.

However, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—commonly referred to as “bad cholesterol”—can build up in your arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe dietary changes can significantly impact cholesterol levels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since high cholesterol usually does not cause symptoms, it is often only detected through blood tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists stress that adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, including dietary changes, is crucial for keeping cholesterol under control and reducing cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Natural foods proven to lower LDL cholesterol and support heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oats: A natural cholesterol-lowering food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are rich in soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucan, which plays a key role in lowering high cholesterol levels. When consumed, beta-glucan forms a gel-like substance in the gut that traps cholesterol-rich bile acids, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your liver then uses more cholesterol from the blood to produce bile, naturally reducing LDL cholesterol levels. Clinical studies suggest that consuming approximately 3.5 grams of beta-glucan from oats daily over 3 to 12 weeks can result in a 4.2% reduction in LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;All forms of oats—including rolled oats, steel-cut oats, and oat bran—are excellent sources of beta-glucan. Beyond cholesterol management, oats also support digestion, maintain steady blood sugar levels, and contribute to overall cardiovascular wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Plant sterols and stanols: Nature’s statin alternatives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Some dairy products, like fortified milk and yogurt, are enriched with these compounds to provide a higher therapeutic dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in the British Journal of Nutrition indicates that consuming up to 3.3 grams of phytosterols daily can reduce LDL cholesterol by 6–12% within a month. These compounds work by competing with cholesterol for absorption, effectively lowering the amount of LDL in your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While phytosterols are naturally found in fruits, vegetables, vegetable oils, nuts, and grains, the daily intake from these sources is usually below 600 mg—far less than the effective dose achieved through fortified foods. Cardiologists recommend including fortified foods with adequate plant sterols or stanols to achieve meaningful cholesterol reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate these foods into your diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To harness the cholesterol-lowering power of oats and plant sterols, consider the following practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your day with oatmeal or overnight oats topped with fruits and nuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include fortified dairy products like milk, yogurt, or spreads rich in plant sterols.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complement your diet with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to enhance overall heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before making significant dietary changes, especially if you have existing medical conditions or take medications, consult your cardiologist or a registered dietitian to ensure safe and effective cholesterol management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

She worked hard, managed daily stress, and brushed aside the little aches and discomforts that seemed part of a busy lifestyle. Headaches? Stress. Dry skin? Weather. Fatigue and muscle cramps? Probably overwork. Like many people, she never imagined these “ordinary” problems could point to something far more dangerous. But a routine checkup shattered that illusion: Unaiza was living with chronic kidney failure. Her story is a wake-up call for thousands who may unknowingly dismiss early symptoms of kidney disease, allowing it to progress silently until it becomes life-threatening. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29052380" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="kidney-failure-symptoms" source="keywords"&gt;Kidney failure symptoms&lt;/keyword&gt; that you might ignore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Unaiza says the signs were always there. Persistent headaches, itchy or dry skin, confusion, lack of concentration, chest-tightening anxiety, leg pain, and muscle cramps were all shrugged off as side effects of stress or overwork. “They felt too normal to be dangerous,” she recalls. Ignoring them meant years of hidden damage to her kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that kidney disease often masquerades as harmless issues like tiredness, back pain, or frequent urination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other early indicators include unexplained swelling around the ankles, puffiness around the eyes, changes in urination patterns (such as increased frequency, foamy, dark, or bloody urine), nausea, loss of appetite, and extreme fatigue. This overlap makes kidney disease especially tricky to detect early without medical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which symptom do you consider most concerning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why kidneys fail quietly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors often call kidney failure a silent killer because the early stages don’t cause dramatic symptoms. The kidneys keep working in the background, even when partially damaged, until the disease reaches an advanced stage. By the time severe signs like fluid retention, breathlessness, or extreme weakness appear, more than 80% of kidney function may already be lost. Regular check-ups, especially for high-risk individuals, can help detect problems early and prevent further damage through timely medical intervention and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quiet progression is what makes awareness crucial. People with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or a family history are at much higher risk. “The danger is not that kidneys stop suddenly, but that they decline gradually while you think everything is fine,” says one nephrologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One simple step that changes everything&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could have saved Unaiza years of decline? A basic blood and urine test. “It doesn’t take much time or money, but it can save your life,” she says. Doctors emphasize that a simple kidney function test can detect problems long before symptoms become severe, making treatment far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend that high-risk individuals get checked at least once a year. Regular monitoring not only prevents late detection but also helps in controlling other linked conditions such as high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes complications. Early diagnosis can reduce the need for dialysis or transplantation in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lessons to take away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unaiza now shares her story online to remind others not to downplay subtle changes in their health. She urges people to listen to their bodies and never ignore signs that persist. Doctors add that unusual urination patterns, unexplained swelling, puffiness around the eyes, persistent headaches, itchy skin, confusion, anxiety, muscle cramps, or extreme fatigue should always be checked promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early intervention doesn’t just slow kidney damage — it can completely change a patient’s quality of life. Lifestyle changes such as staying hydrated, reducing salt intake, eating balanced meals, and exercising regularly all contribute to healthier kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her message is simple: don’t wait until it’s too late. What feels like “just stress” might be something your body has been trying to warn you about all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also See: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/nighttime-symptoms-that-reveal-your-heart-liver-and-kidney-health-early-earning-signs-you-shouldnt-ignore/articleshow/124108226.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nighttime symptoms that reveal your heart, liver, and kidney health: Early earning signs you shouldn’t ignore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 04:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_gFBVV95cUxPa09zd1BrZnEtWUl4V2V2SDFjNG41aXh2RUFka2tvdDhmYjBqZGZwV1ZiZ2tDWE5GZEVtcndtcTZoeTBYc3lGNGZUelhtZERpM0dNWmd2NzEtLXhZSm9pcEowMjBfTjlKNnJOZmJjbF9RMXE2bW01X0xDa1BQNWJFWlZ5YzNZQkVLTmxWZ3NTVFl3RENYRjh6cEI0Zjkwa1JGcUFSaHVYdVZuRnhoNmEyNm11QVcyamtiZ2NQWk1NYmw1M1NNMWx4YUxiaVZsUG1SRS1LUnA1TFlwMHptSG1OVFFZSXhJdkl2UnREbjlwT2pkSkhEczFrR3ZYMVpTUQ</guid></item><item><title>你有没有给植物园附近的蝙蝠喝水？它有狂犬病-西雅图时报</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/rabid-bat-found-in-seattle-near-washington-park-arboretum/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-byline"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two unidentified people who gave water to a bat near Washington Park Arboretum in Seattle may have been exposed to rabies, public health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat was found Tuesday in the 1700 block of Boyer Avenue East, a residential road near the arboretum, according to Public Health — Seattle &amp;amp; King County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A resident found a note on their door alerting them to a sick bat and saying two unknown people had given it water, the health agency &lt;a href="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/09/25/rabid-bat-found-in-seattle-near-washington-park-arboretum/" data-type="link" data-id="https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/09/25/rabid-bat-found-in-seattle-near-washington-park-arboretum/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;said in an online alert&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bat was euthanized by an animal control agency on Wednesday and a test confirmed it had rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is life-threatening but treatable if caught early and treated before any symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health has not been able to identify the two people who gave water to the bat. No other people are known to have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any person or animal that touched the bat or its saliva could be at risk, the agency said. Anyone who might have had contact with the bat should immediately seek medical evaluation or call Public Health at 206-296-4774 to see if preventive treatment is necessary, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once they develop an infection, the symptoms will vary. NDM-CRE can cause such ailments as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections and wound infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms can include fever, chills with cough, shortness of breath if the bacteria infect the lung, and pain or blood when urinating if the bladder/kidneys are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the bacteria are resistant to most antibiotics, treatment options are severely limited, leading to slower recovery and higher risk of serious complications or death, Gohil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason health officials are concerned is because the bacteria can spread to others and survive on contaminated surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can test for NDM-CRE, but most people do not need to be tested unless they are at higher risk for having it, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those at risk are people who have been “in a hospital (especially in another country), had repeated antibiotics, hospital stays, or invasive medical procedures, or if you’re sick and been in contact with someone known to have NDM-CRE,” Gohil said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing for the bacteria is also difficult because many hospitals and clinics do not have the tools to rapidly detect it in patients even when the patient is not sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-ndm-cre" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against NDM-CRE&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;NDM-CRE is caused by overuse of powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be an opportunity for us to change the narrative where all patients typically want antibiotics,” Nanda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanda advises patients who are being prescribed with antibiotics to ask their healthcare provider:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why they’re getting prescribed the antibiotics? Why is it necessary? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about your options. Make sure you’ve exhausted all other treatments options before going straight to antibiotics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you need it, you need it, but then be judicious about it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because NDM-CRE infections happen to people who are very sick, patients in hospitals or in long-term care, experts recommend that patients, healthcare staff and visitors in these settings wash their hands and avoid contact with dirty surfaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 01:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2AFBVV95cUxQcDlJMENRU1RkOHlObHhmWVNaMksxekFZaHhIcTZKanJDLXZTem9EUVJ6cF95WEtNdk9wRTVMUGtoLVN2bFRoYTZSNWQ0cGJuR3dQSlpsVWxteGxVV1BTNzNPUl9ZSF9xMU5WWmRnUUw5b2ZHeGY5anpaLUpLNU1uZ3VkLUVZdkhyOEI1UUtmeGNKNk1zNXc4aExTdmpNV1Q1YW93dlhHUmI2UVJlTzhKQ2VHd3JNNFVuSmUxNGMyOVJidzFFY0tVdldXT04zVC1lMjlIR2tGTlg</guid></item><item><title>为什么自闭症真的在上升？科学说了什么-大自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03143-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-header__restrict"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eastern equine encephalitis virus has recently returned to Vermont, with mosquitoes in Orleans, Addison and Franklin counties testing positive for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging Vermonters to protect themselves from mosquito bites, warning the virus — while rare — can be serious and deadly to humans. Last year, one Chittenden County man in his 70s died of the virus in one of two cases of serious illness in the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, mosquitoes have tested positive for the virus in Swanton and Vergeness, and a horse in Brownington is also suspected of carrying the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Department of Health strongly encouraged Vermonters to take measures to prevent mosquito bites. Officials encouraged people to wear long-sleeve shirts and pants outdoors, use bug repellant that’s effective against mosquitoes, avoid leaving standing water and limit time outside around dawn and dusk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes may be more likely to carry the virus in areas where it’s been detected, said Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From June through October, technicians with the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets venture out to about 110 surveillance sites around the state, where they trap mosquitoes for testing, according to Patti Casey, who oversees environmental surveillance for the agency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists with the agency currently monitor the West Nile virus, the Jamestown Canyon virus and the Eastern equine encephalitis virus. It’s the first summer state scientists have tested for the &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/25/mosquitoes-test-positive-for-jamestown-canyon-virus-for-the-first-time-in-vermont/"&gt;Jamestown virus&lt;/a&gt;, with the first human case of the virus in Vermont &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/current-news-releases/first-human-case-jamestown-canyon-virus-confirmed-vermont"&gt;confirmed earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s rare, people who do experience serious illness from EEE suffer from symptoms like fever, headache, vomiting or body aches. “The risk is low because most people don’t tend to get sick, but among those who do, it could be very dangerous,” Kwit said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those with symptoms, only 5% get seriously ill, Kwit said. But one-third of people who experience serious symptoms die, she said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last year’s EEE surge was the first time scientists saw an uptick in the virus in Vermont since 2012, Kwit said. Then, alerts from health officials prompted organizers in Vermont’s Queen City to &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2024/09/03/eee-has-come-to-vermont-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-mosquito-based-virus/"&gt;cancel a number of outdoor events&lt;/a&gt; or move them inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus typically comes to the Northeast in 8-to-10-year cycles, often ramping up for several years at a time, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe that pattern happens because the virus “amplifies” in an exchange between mosquitoes and bird populations — and birds’ migration patterns bring the virus across the country, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary vector mosquitoes feed almost exclusively on bird populations. They transmit the disease among birds until many mosquitoes and birds are carrying the virus, Casey said. Then, bridge vector mosquitoes, which feed on birds and other animals, transfer the virus beyond birds — notably to humans and horses, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Horses cannot transfer the virus to humans and are recommended to be annually vaccinated for the virus, Casey said. Horses who are sick with the virus tend to suffer neurological symptoms, like falling over and stumbling, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month, one horse in Brownington is suspected to have had the virus, but tests weren’t able to explicitly confirm it was infected, Casey said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kwit said no vaccine exists for humans, and there’s no approved treatment for people with symptoms. To protect themselves, people should follow recommendations from health officials, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says that it receives little data on variants from the states every year, leading it to have 'low confidence' in the estimates, but it warns that the variant is likely causing an increasing proportion of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency's wastewater estimates are based on reports from hundreds of sites across the US that analyze the water for signs of Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An uptick indicates more people are shedding the virus, suggesting that infections are rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;XFG was first detected in January in Southeast Asia and was found in the US two months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, it accounted for just three percent of Covid infections in the US. But as of September 9, it now makes up 80 percent of US Covid cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a hybrid of two existing omicron strains, LF.7 and LP.8.1.2, meaning it carries genetic material from both variants, allowing it to more easily bind to cells in the body and trigger infection than previous variants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms are similar to previous variants, with major signs including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, body aches, headache, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the nine states with growing infections, South Dakota is the only one reporting 'very high' Covid activity in its wastewater, while Minnesota and Delaware reported 'high' levels. The remainder had moderate, low or very low levels, with the exception being North Dakota, which did not have data available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows a decrease in Covid viral activity in wastewater, according to the latest CDC data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wastewater levels increased 2.2 percent in Delaware and six percent in Minnesota compared to the previous weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite having the highest levels, South Dakota saw a decrease of seven percent compared to the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;South Dakota's 'very high' activity could be due to its high concentration of Native American reservations, which historically have less access to quality healthcare. As for Minnesota, the state's cold temperatures increase the amount of gatherings inside during the winter, which increases viral transmission rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Delaware, meanwhile, has a significant aging population, with 28 percent of residents being 60 and older. These groups are generally more vulnerable to infections due to having weakened immune systems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The variant is, however, showing signs of slowing nationwide. About 1.5 per 100,000 hospitalizations were due to Covid during the week ending September 13, the latest data available, down from 2.5 per 100,000 the week before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Test positivity is also down to 9.5 percent the week ending September 13 from 10.9 percent during the previous week, and emergency department visits are down from 1.6 percent to 1.2 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 21:14:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPamViMG9HNy1wNW9XaWVmelZDbk9veUR1LVZlMmxKcEd1QnJBV21MU25PMjVBTmNrWjBWNUZqTGNXMk9fVkxBSnkxbnIyeFZyZkxBRWpKTnh5ZF96d0xIOWZJQU9nUEh6ckdTX09tam9fR29VOUI4UXVIdjFlQ3BMb3JnWkJJVFEzUkt4NXUzN2dKVlhkSi1qNEhaMlRDeTc1WVZEa09zcGvSAa4BQVVfeXFMUDZvX1JDdUlPbE5XMFhWeUQwWjE2cnV4YWhlajJxMEF0VmxLcEVFQ1RDemdSTG1NSU1DOWRMTG03WkJPbHVWc25JZHVlZHB5bFlQRUhJaVBLbTFQc1N6ZS14ZGJGclVKZXlSRkQ5ZUJIN1N0QlRsU2t2ZWtSdk5qLVJEOXFwQjZ4Z0l1bjd0c3lYb1F0b2ctLVBlY0JidDd3eF9GSFdLUzQ1cUNSSHN3</guid></item><item><title>2岁的妈妈在认为自己患有鼻窦感染后分享了卵巢癌的诊断- ABC新闻-突发新闻，最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/mom-2-shares-ovarian-cancer-diagnosis-after-thinking/story?id=125812844</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;An Ohio mom is opening up about being diagnosed with &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/video/125515600" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt; after initially thinking she had a sinus infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In January, Jessica Gilbert, a mom of two from the Cincinnati, Ohio, area, was getting ready for a family trip to Disney World, a Christmas present for her 11-year-old and 7-year-old, when she starting feeling &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/suffering-flu-rsv-covid-19-difference-94211146" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I woke up with a fever, and I thought it was a sinus infection because I had a stuffy head all week," Gilbert told ABC News.
