                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s not unusual for a 20-something to text Mom in a panic from the doctor’s office, seeking help answering a question. And patients of any age can struggle to recall all their medicines — or forget to mention a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the most out of a doctor’s visit requires some advance preparation. Even the professionals plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really hard — even for me as a doctor going to see my own family doctor — to remember the things that I wanted to bring up,” said Dr. Sarah Nosal, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. “The worst is when you’ve had that moment with your doctor” only to recall another problem after walking out, she said. “You’ve lost that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her top tip: Bring a list of symptoms and questions to show at the start of the visit. The first item should be your top concern, but seeing the full list helps your doctor prioritize what’s most medically urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m actually going to be able to see, is there a red flag?” explained Nosal, who has some advice about prepping for a typical primary care visit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Your primary care doctor monitors your overall health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some illnesses require specialists like a cardiologist or rheumatologist. But regardless of your age or how healthy you are, research has long shown that a relationship with a primary care provider is important for overall health. It might be a family physician like Nosal, who cares for all ages, or an internist. Some patients choose gynecologists, geriatricians, or have a primary care team that includes nurse practitioners or physician assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary care is more than preventive checkups to help avoid illness, such as vaccinations, cancer screenings or health advice. It also includes detecting and treating common problems like high blood pressure, and helping to find and coordinate specialty care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That ongoing relationship also helps me know your ‘normal,’” Nosal explained. “If something’s different or changes or you feel off, when you tell me that information and I also have known you over time, we can really figure out together what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Quiz your family before the appointment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults navigating health care on their own for the first time may need help filling out forms with their personal medical history. Have you ever had general anesthesia? Is your tetanus shot up to date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you still have access to the patient portal at your former pediatrician’s office, you can see records of vaccinations and prior illnesses, or you may have to request them or quiz parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all ages, family medical history is critical — and needs regular updating. Ask what diseases your close relatives have had and how they fared. For example, if Type 2 diabetes runs in the family, or Grandma had a stroke, or someone had cancer at a young age, that information could help tailor your preventive care, Nosal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fill out your paperwork ahead of the visit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filling out paperwork from home makes it easier to check medicine bottles for the name and dose. Include both prescription and over-the-counter medicines, pills or creams — and don’t forget vitamins and supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are the latter important? Some can interact with prescription medicines. Nosal cited some patients whose longtime treatments quit working after they started taking turmeric, a spice also sold as a supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also before your visit, check if the doctor received records of recent lab tests, hospitalizations or visits to other health providers, since electronic medical records aren’t always automatically shared.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Keep a running list of questions before a doctor visit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms are bad enough to prompt an urgent visit. But if you’ve got a checkup coming, whether it’s routine or to follow up on health problems, start a list of questions in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice a pain when you move a certain way? Or chatting with a friend who just got a colonoscopy and wonder if you’re due? Pop those on your list right away, before you forget — and be specific in describing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosal keeps a running list on her phone and, ahead of visits with her own doctor, sends it as a heads-up through her patient portal. Patients also can include their list on visit check-in forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to address the most urgent questions first, rather than patients running out of time before raising a key concern. Nosal said questions about mental or sexual health and wellness especially tend to come up at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the medium, “please bring that list,” she said. “That’s the most critical of all pieces.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;It’s OK to ask again&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may know to ask questions about treatments, such as how well they work and what side effects to expect. But it’s also important to understand why a doctor makes a particular diagnosis or, conversely, isn’t as worried about a symptom as you might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to say, “Explain to me what else could be going on,” Nosal advised. “What would be the next step? How would you evaluate that for me, to know if it’s this or that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most health advocacy groups also advise bringing along a friend or relative, especially if you have serious or multiple health problems. They can help ask questions and take notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are 20 or you are 85, you will not remember everything from your medical visit,” Nosal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But mid-plank, the instructor’s comment caught me off guard, and didn’t sit well with me the rest of the day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Let’s work off all that Halloween candy!” she shouted into her mic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The nonchalant phrase of “let’s work off ___,” while surely intended as a lighthearted joke, is seriously problematic, according to experts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The idea that you need to out-exercise food or earn any treats isn’t just prevalent during Halloween ― it’s also extremely common to hear during the holiday season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s why this mentality needs to stop, and how you can feel good in your body instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Experts explain why it's important to overcome the damaging notion that you have to work out in order to eat holiday meals or treats.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It discredits the more important benefits of exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I definitely wasn’t at the gym that morning to burn off Sugar Daddys and Dots.

We should exercise for cardiovascular health, for mental health, for emotional health. It gives structure to your day.

Instead, regular exercise can help you feel more motivated in other areas of your life and that you’ve started the day off in a productive way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What that walk and that workout class is not going to do is burn off what you ate right before,” she said. “That way of thinking is big, big trouble.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“There are so many reasons to exercise.

Hopefully simply excited, and not anything else. According to Alyssa Royse, owner of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rocketcommunityfitness.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rocket Community Fitness" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rocketcommunityfitness.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rocket Community Fitness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Seattle, the mindset that you have to deserve that pie or undo the damage is “really dangerous.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It links us to this idea that we have to earn the right to eat and have to earn the right to have pleasure. Both of those things are innate in simply having a body ... by virtue of being alive, you are allowed [both],” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we moralize food, we trigger all sorts of dangerous thoughts and behavior patterns in people,” she continued. &lt;/span&gt;This includes eating disorders, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/eating-disorders" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="major long-term health complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/eating-disorders" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;major long-term health complications&lt;/a&gt; like heart damage, hair growth issues, brain damage, lethargy and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Instead of creating these negative connections, trainers in her gym don’t mention food. If the holidays do come up, they try to focus on positive aspects like, “go have fun and enjoy the bounty, go feel the joy ... that’s the primary purpose of your body ― to experience joy,” Royse said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Royse added that people already have these damaging thoughts on their own around the holidays, as a result of years of toxic messaging in media where people are pushed to be thinner. She encourages her clients to challenge these connections they and others have made, and move instead toward body and food neutrality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Food doesn’t need to be an emotional or moral experience. You are allowed to just have it,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keefe also noted that shaming yourself for what you ate can have an additional physical consequences. As a result of the stress hormones you release through that thought pattern, you can experience &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="stomach pains and digestive problems" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;stomach pains and digestive problems&lt;/a&gt; (along with so many other issues like headaches, heart palpitations and more).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; “You’re really making yourself suffer twice,” she said. Instead, she emphasizes enjoying it and moving on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Food doesn’t need to be an emotional or moral experience.

This process, also known as mindful eating, is where you pay close attention to your food ― mentally noticing how it tastes and how enjoyable it feels to eat it. It also has you listen to your natural hunger and fullness cues. Food is not something you’ve “earned” and there is absolutely no expectation that you need to “work it off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Royse said she specifically tries to drink more water (one glass per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/holiday-drink-recipes_n_5a2818d8e4b02d3bfc3774ae" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="holiday cocktail" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6939aeb8e4b007ac563b48db" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5a2818d8e4b02d3bfc3774ae" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;holiday cocktail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and take more walks, not as a penalty but as a way to counteract any physical discomfort she might be feeling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keefe enjoys whatever holiday foods she wants, while also prioritizing nutrition.

        &lt;p&gt;Want to visualize radioactive particles? You don’t need a boatload of lab equipment. Just a cloud chamber. And [Curious Scientist] is showing off an &lt;a href="https://curiousscientist.tech/blog/diy-cloud-chamber-with-hv-grid" target="_blank"&gt;improved miniature cloud chamber&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to replicate using a 3D printer and common components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build uses a Peltier module, a CPU cooler, an aluminum plate, thermal paste, and headlight film. The high voltage comes from a sacrificed mosquito swatter. The power input for the whole system is any 12V supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud chamber was high tech back in 1911 when physicist Charles T. R. Wilson made ionizing radiation visible by creating trails of tiny liquid droplets in a supersaturated vapor of alcohol or water. Charged particles pass through, leaving visible condensation trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-885801"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the post, the cost of everything is under $100. He hasn’t made the 3D printed parts freely available, but there are enough pictures that you can probably work it out yourself. Besides, you’d almost certainly have to rework it for your particular jar, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, a cloud chamber’s construction isn’t a state secret. We’ve seen some fancy &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/09/desk-top-peltier-powered-cloud-chamber-uses-desktop-parts/"&gt;Peltier-based designs&lt;/a&gt;. If you manage your expectations, you can build one for even less using a &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/02/11/maybe-the-simplest-cloud-chamber/"&gt;plastic bottle and ingenuity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	            &lt;/div&gt;

He loves his humans and life in general, and as far as Golden Retrievers go, he’s as loyal as they come. Anyone who meets Boone can tell instantly that he takes his role as a family member very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine his surprise when his family betrayed that loyalty by having a backyard photo shoot without him. There they were, dressed nicely and standing arm in arm in front of the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-loses-ball-bushes-120000740.html" data-ylk="slk:bushes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;bushes&lt;/a&gt;—and where was 5-year-old Boone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the house, dramatically making a scene in the window for all to see! Boone made sure his humans could not miss how he was feeling about the obvious oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluffy Golden Retriever spotted his humans out in the yard and clearly felt like he belonged out there, too. He propped himself up at the &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news/goldendoodle-conducts-neighborhood-trash-truck-watch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:window;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;window &lt;/a&gt;and performed his best air bicycle routine against the glass, desperately trying to get their attention.

You forgot me!” or “How dare you leave me out of the photo—I make everything better!” And he’s not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let's Check in With the Comment Section&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TikTok video, recently shared by @golden_boy_boone, quickly captured viewers’ attention. Many of the Golden Retriever’s fans were flabbergasted that he’d intentionally been left out of the portrait. @blah asked, “Now, why would you leave him out?” while @feegs23 summed it up perfectly with a simple, “How rude!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of Boone’s fellow four-legged TikTok stars also took his side. @RebaandDolly declared, “Rude! Your family photo is missing the main character!” while @Mygoldennuggettito exclaimed, “What!!! Get him out there now!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite not being in the actual photo, Boone let everyone know that he was the star of the show, nonetheless!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news/golden-retriever-left-out-of-family-photo-everyone-upset" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PawNation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PawNation&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 20, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; section.

There are questions about what happens over Christmas when everyone meets up and it's easier for the virus to infect older people who are more at risk. There are also signs a different strain of flu - H1N1 - is picking up in Europe and may lead to an increase in cases here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But a "broadly typical flu season" is probably not the sense you'd get from watching or reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Statistical artistry was used to compare an early flu season to one that started much later allowing claims of flu cases being &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-ready-double-whammy-winter-fludemic-strikes/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"an incredible 10 times higher"&lt;/a&gt; than in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It was technically true, but is like saying your train to Glasgow got you there in record time… but the journey time was identical, you just booked an earlier train. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;NHS England was not the first organisation to start calling it superflu, but Prof Meghana Pandit, national medical director at NHS England, did label it an "&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8r30787e76o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;unprecedented wave of super flu&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It has been suggested by the British Medical Association that flu has been used to scaremonger while resident doctors were deciding whether to continue their strike action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Superflu isn't a scientific description and the BBC Health Team has not found any expert who thinks it is an accurate one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I don't think it's a helpful term, there isn't a particularly unusual set of symptoms, there's no indication of it being associated with exceptional severity, exceptionally rapid spread or exceptional health impact," says Prof Fraser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One of the UK's top flu scientists, Prof Nicola Lewis, the director of the World Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, said the virus was "not particularly unusual" and that she saw "no evidence" the virus was "particularly different" and superflu "wouldn't be my description".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The former deputy chief medical officer for England through the pandemic, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7405275742994919424/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7405275742994919424%2C7405516492009676800%29&amp;amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7405275742994919424%2C7406388088220065792%29&amp;amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287405516492009676800%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7405275742994919424%29&amp;amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287406388088220065792%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7405275742994919424%29" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm very unclear what is meant by the rather silly term of 'superflu'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Crying wolf?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Persuading people to get the flu vaccine saves lives and last winter the jabs were estimated to have kept around 100,000 people &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-prevented-around-100000-hospital-admissions" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;out of hospital&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, experts have started to question whether the escalation in language used since the Covid pandemic could harm trust in official health advice. Previous winters came with warnings of a tripledemic of flu, Covid and RSV; then it was upgraded to a quademic adding in norovirus; this year it's superflu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Simon Williams, who researches psychology and public health at Swansea University, says there are issues with the "current language around every winter being 'the worst' in some way or another" and risks a "cry wolf" effect that damages trust and means people become "numb" to the advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said there was a danger of "over-using the narrative that viruses will overwhelm the NHS" when "ultimately the NHS hasn't got overwhelmed to the point of not being able to carry out emergency and basic functions".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Instead he argues a "fine balance" is needed between raising awareness and "not falling into the trap of fear-messaging or being overly alarmist, which can backfire".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University, agrees saying: "I think it is a concern to use words like super flu, when we may one day experience a real super flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to be very, very careful about how we communicate these things to the public, because there is a risk that we can cry wolf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:06:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5tSUo1a2tSTFFDTzVSLTZSSDJlUWxzVTNnZU9ZczdvbEZOZHRtZXN6MlY2UUs2TkVmWTRtc3JvTm1ZeFJibnZwRWJZTXV2OVRTd1dvd3FiOGliZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9ncGlJaU55Rm9xR3dHS1JIZmpVTkJUN0lCNmd6UFllOWJZM19nSFo3cVdCYXZtSGl0UlQ0RUJZNy1VNUFSTG5NdmlRUXFyc1RyTEtQeEdBSGplWE1lUUR3</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，随着年龄的增长，这种早晨的习惯可以支持您的骨骼健康- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-bone-health-study-11873585</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests morning tea drinkers may have stronger bones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tea is linked to improved bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study excluded decaffeinated or herbal tea, but included all other varieties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis seems to be one of those often overlooked conditions that takes a back seat to more urgent ones, like heart disease and cancer. But in the bigger health picture, osteoporosis can also impact quality of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis is a disease that develops when your bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass decrease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s often referred to as a "silent" disease because it typically has no symptoms—until you break a bone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The risk of osteoporosis increases with age, especially after menopause. Based on the latest data, about 13% of U.S. adults over 50 were diagnosed with osteoporosis; this number jumps to almost 18% for those 65 and over.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If we consider just women, 13% of those in the 50 to 64 age bracket had osteoporosis, and 27% of those aged 65 and over had the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors influence one’s risk for osteoporosis, many of them lifestyle-related. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercises-women-over-50-for-strong-bones-11833636" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight-bearing exercise&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and walking, may help prevent osteoporosis. Smoking and heavy alcohol use increase your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;what you eat also plays a role in bone health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that foods, like dairy, are rich in bone-supporting nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin D, some beverages have not yet locked in their bone-health status. Take coffee and tea, for example. Studies have been inconsistent in their results regarding coffee and tea consumption and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-every-week-for-stronger-bones-11853649" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone mineral density&lt;/a&gt; in postmenopausal women. That’s why researchers in Australia took a closer look at this topic, trying to clear up some of the confusion. They published their findings in &lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew about 10 years of data from a 20-year study called the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), which included more than 9,700 women aged 65 and older. At clinical visits during years two, four, five and six of the study, the participants had their femoral neck and total hip bone mineral densities measured, which are common BMD measurement sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same clinical visits, participants also completed self-administered questionnaires regarding coffee and tea consumption. Specifically, for coffee, they were asked, "Do you currently drink regular coffee? If yes, on average, how many cups of regular coffee do you usually consume per day?" For tea consumption, participants were asked "Do you currently drink tea or iced tea (excluding herbal or decaffeinated varieties)? If yes, on average, how many cups of tea do you usually consume per day?"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Demographics, which would be adjusted for during statistical analyses, were also collected, including age, BMI, cigarette smoking status, age at menopause, lifetime alcohol intake, lifetime physical activity and oral estrogen and steroid use. Medical histories were also taken, and weekly calcium and protein intake were calculated based on a 20-item dietary scale that participants completed at baseline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found no positive benefits of drinking coffee on bone mineral density. However, they did find potential negative effects on bone mineral density for those who drank more than five cups of coffee a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tea drinkers, however, may have an advantage over coffee drinkers, as researchers found an association between tea consumption and higher total hip bone mineral density in older postmenopausal women.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note a few limitations to their study, starting with participants' self-reporting of coffee and tea consumption. Related to this, participants were not asked more detailed questions, like the size of their beverage cups and beverage strength. In addition, due to the length of follow-up (10 years) and the ages of the women, some died before the study’s end, and others were unable to finish due to health reasons. The dwindling participant pool may have weakened the study results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee and tea are some of the most widely consumed beverages globally. Because they’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt;, they contain antioxidants and the potential to lower inflammation and disease risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coffee has been linked with&lt;/a&gt; a healthier heart and brain, among other benefits. It might also boost your mood and give you more energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a regular tea sipper, you might even live longer and have a stronger immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The great thing about tea is that there’s a flavor for everyone. From green, black and white to jasmine, rooibos and mint, teas span the flavor spectrum—and they're all loaded with powerful plant compounds. If you want to go beyond traditional hot or iced tea, brew up some of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8050463/how-to-make-thai-iced-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Thai Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266309/warm-honey-green-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Warm Honey Green Tea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/berry-green-tea-smoothie-8746131" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Berry Green Tea Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to bone health, other foods also have an influence. For example, you’re aware that dairy is good for your bones, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-protein-for-bone-health-11719674" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;canned salmon&lt;/a&gt; is also a great bone builder.

They look kind of dazed. They’re miserable. There’s a glassy look to their eyes,” he said.

While anyone of any age can be affected, H3N2 tends to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6c3fd" class="body-graf"&gt;There is concern that kids who are sick now with flu will spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;“With schools going on break for a couple of weeks and family gatherings happening, it’s quite possible that some of the existing mixing of viruses amongst the school groups are going to change to a different population,” Budd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fdf" class="body-heading"&gt;Where is flu spreading? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-96f626"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1238" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg" alt="U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512050" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu activity is high or very high in 14 states — including Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey and South Carolina — as well as New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecda59" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu doesn’t need to be widespread, however, to be deadly. While the CDC’s latest report shows “minimal” flu activity in Wisconsin, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/121825.htm" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that a child in the state died of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3493" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/17/ncdhhs-announces-first-pediatric-flu-death-2025-26-season-urges-vaccination-children-6-months-and" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bac42a" class="body-graf"&gt;Those cases are likely not counted among the CDC’s latest report, which shows three pediatric flu deaths so far this year, as the data is current through Dec. 13. The CDC’s next flu update will release on Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c71f8" class="body-graf"&gt;The 2024-2025 flu season was particularly deadly, especially for children. According to the latest data, 288 children died of flu — tying a record set during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b0029" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report published in September&lt;/a&gt; found that half of the children who died of flu last year were otherwise healthy. About 89% hadn’t received the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d434f" class="body-heading"&gt;Will the flu shot work this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1aecc" class="body-graf"&gt;The annual flu shot is notoriously imperfect when it comes to matching the exact strains of flu that circulate. This year, a strain called H3N2 subclade K emerged, making changes on the surface protein of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896c6d" class="body-graf"&gt;The surface protein is important because that’s what the body looks for to recognize whether it’s seen the virus before. If the protein looks even slightly different, the body may not be able to fight it off as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-571039" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s hard to predict how well this vaccine will ultimately work. Even though the strain has “drifted” a bit, the vaccines do contain protection against H3N2 virus in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9904a1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve had past seasons where there have been what we call drifted viruses, which is how we would categorize this subclade K,” she said. “In some of those instances, there have been impacts on vaccine effectiveness, but there have also been seasons with drifted strains where we’ve seen the vaccine continue to provide protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9de3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s important for everyone, including children, to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7605af" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is still the primary preventive measure against flu, severe illness, and we absolutely continue to recommend it this year, even in light of the drifted strain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-527bf3" class="body-graf"&gt;Demand for Tamiflu, an antiviral used to help treat the flu, is slightly higher than it was this time last year, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research/flu-season-tracking-tamiflu-fills" target="_blank"&gt;according to GoodRx.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31e609" class="body-graf"&gt;People generally only get prescription antivirals when they’re sick enough to go to the doctor, not just because they tested positive for the flu, said Tori Marsh, senior director of research for GoodRx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e97017" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“What stands out this season is how early Tamiflu use is climbing,” she said. “When we see prescription antiviral use rise sooner than average, it often points to flu activity building earlier and potentially lasting longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:42:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxORnhRcmJjVjJpVVlaM0N1S1hYeUxCazA0OFlfNnhQUVUzeXZlMTZmYjFPMl9wc0ZhMjRkdFNmbWFCWl9KVW9JbENONUlnRE5GYXhhRTMyZ05Ib28wSjlndG9xZ2VxUElWSVItMjV2Z3VHYlNIdjU2UHhvOUZjZHp1WWNWbEE3em1aVHlqSlVoSC1vRFhmVXhGR0tDTkdObXJORGZGQnhadU5lRm5O0gFWQVVfeXFMT3FFR0pETzRtRWdmV3N4cjVOLTJpU2UtTGNJNmVxWEhaWFh1U29BbnpwME1FQWVQS3dIckFiUXJfWlZoTi1od2h3UkphbVpxMzVEekIxQ0E</guid></item><item><title>随着流感开始蔓延，湾区学区近三分之一的孩子生病--《旧金山纪事报》</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/marin-flu-outbreak-schools-21252876.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration has awarded a $1.6 million, no-bid contract to a Danish university to study hepatitis B vaccinations on newborns in Africa that is raising ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual contract was awarded to scientists who have been cited by anti-vaccine activists and whose work has been questioned by leading public health experts. Some experts have suggested the research plan is unethical, because it will withhold vaccines that work from newborns at significant risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract did not undergo a customary ethics review, The Associated Press has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded the grant to a research team at the University of Southern Denmark that has been lauded by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-12-18/pdf/2025-23245.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal notice posted this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team’s leaders is Christine Stabell Benn, a consultant for a Kennedy-appointed committee that recently voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;stop recommending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a dose of hepatitis B vaccine for all U.S. newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The study is to begin early next year in Guinea-Bissau, an impoverished West African nation where hepatitis B infection &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746078/#:~:text=Results:%20A%20total%20of%202715,enqu%C3%AAtes%20dans%20la%20population%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The researchers are funded for five years to study 14,000 newborns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s to be a randomized controlled trial, with some infants given the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and some not. Children will be tracked for death, illness and long-term developmental outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children will be followed for less than two years to look for side effects, but the first 500 enrolled will be followed for five years to look for behavior and brain development problems. There is no placebo involved, according to a copy of the study protocol prepared earlier this year that was obtained by the AP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can be passed from an infected mother to a baby. It also can be spread by other infected people a baby comes in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Research and widespread medical consensus holds that the hepatitis B vaccine protects newborns, so withholding it from some babies — in this case, Black babies — has raised ethical alarms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical evidence is clear that the vaccine protects infants from developing liver disease and an early death. The well-documented infection risk far outweighs hypothetical concerns about side effects, said Dr. Boghuma K. Titanji, an Emory University infectious diseases doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called the study “unconscionable,” and said it likely will exacerbate existing vaccine hesitancy in Africa and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much potential for this to be a harmful study,” said Titanji, who is from Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benn did not respond to an email seeking comment about the proposal. An automatic response said she is out of the office until early January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the research team said the study “will be the first and likely the only one of its kind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said it takes advantage of an unusual window of opportunity: Guinea-Bissau doesn’t currently recommended a birth dose of the hep B vaccine, but the nation will be implementing universal vaccination of newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine skeptics and opponents have suggested that all the vaccine’s possible side effects were inadequately studied before the CDC began recommending it for newborns in 1991. Public health experts counter that over more than three decades no serious side effect has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award is highly unusual. The CDC did not announce a research funding opportunity and invite proposals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was unsolicited and the award did not go through customary review, said a CDC official with knowledge of the decision. Department of Health and Human Services officials told CDC officials to approve it and said HHS would provide special funding for it, the CDC official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private communications channels, CDC staffers were expressing outrage about the award, said the official, who is not authorized to talk about it and spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those CDC scientists have compared the work to the infamous &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/30ba57133d6b47618eff042285b54d0e"&gt;Tuskegee Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which the agency oversaw in its later stages. In that decades-long study, health workers withheld treatment from unsuspecting Black men infected with syphilis so doctors could track the horrible ravages of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Like Tuskegee, this study involves the prospect of researchers watching people grow ill when a medical intervention could have kept them healthy, Titanji echoed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is an apt comparison,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study’s researchers say the trial was approved by a national ethics committee in Guinea-Bissau. But it did not undergo a customary ethics review within the CDC, the agency official told the AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said “we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists noted questions have been raised in the past about research led by Benn and her husband, Peter Aaby, in their &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this year, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calling a 2017 study co-authored by Aaby and Benn “fundamentally flawed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several researchers had harsh words about the latest award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aaby and Benn are doing the Guinea-Bissau HBV vaccine depravation trial,” Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist, wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlbergstrom.com/post/3mac5tfh4722v" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Bluesky. “Did RFK Jr. just call up the first name in the antivax yellow pages?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/angierasmussen.bsky.social/post/3mablyin5is2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was giving taxpayers’ money to his “cronies” for a “grossly unethical study that will expose African babies to hep B for no reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Researchers found that GABAergic neurons in the BNST activate glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe, causing immediate arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the DpMe neurons were removed, the arousal response weakened dramatically, proving they are essential for this stress-to-wake circuitry. These findings reveal how fear and anxiety can instantly disrupt sleep and point to new therapeutic targets for stress-related insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; BNST GABAergic neurons trigger fast arousal via DpMe glutamatergic neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing DpMe glutamatergic cells sharply reduced stress-induced wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting this circuit may help treat stress-related insomnia and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tsukuba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional states and stress strongly influence sleep-wake regulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala and its related structures have long been implicated in regulating arousal. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers examined how GABAergic neurons in the BNST interact with glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe to induce rapid arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of BNST GABAergic neurons during NREM sleep resulted in immediate arousal, accompanied by a robust increase in DpMe neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, selective ablation of glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe significantly reduced this response, demonstrating their essential role in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to thoroughly describe a BNST-DpMe neural pathway mediating emotional signals to arousal centers. In addition, the findings offer novel insights into how mental stressors such as fear and anxiety can disrupt sleep and highlights potential therapeutic targets for stress-related insomnia and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI), a JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (JP 18H02595) (TS), Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Exploratory) 21K19287(TS), JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (JP 21H05036) (TS), JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 23H04941 (TS), AMED Moonshot Research and Development Program, Grant Number JP21zf0127005 (TS), JSPS Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research 22K213511(TS) and JST, CREST Grant Number JPMJCR24T4, JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A) 23H04941(TS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178162286"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;How does emotional stress wake the brain so quickly?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: By activating a BNST-to-DpMe circuit that instantly shifts NREM sleep into wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178163874"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;Which neurons are required for this arousal response?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe are essential for transmitting the wake-up signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178163665"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;Why does this matter for insomnia?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It identifies a concrete neural pathway that may be overactive in stress-related sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this stress and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c575354534f5548497c495212484f4957495e5d125d5f12564c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Similarly, an aversive air-puff activated GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, suggesting engagement by emotionally salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ablation of GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons markedly attenuated arousal responses triggered by GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; stimulation, underscoring their essential role in this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed local input neurons to GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; cells, in situ hybridization identified few &lt;em&gt;Vgat-&lt;/em&gt;positive interneurons among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons may influence GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through noncanonical GABAergic mechanisms or via more complex local circuits beyond a simple disinhibition model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings delineate a previously uncharacterized BNST–DpMe circuit that allows emotionally relevant stimuli to override sleep and promote arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway may contribute to stress-related sleep disturbances and represents a potential target for therapeutic treatments for sleep disorders associated with emotional dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:15:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9FTzZXdm94cW9FRjRnMERibndvajdHQWszQm91SmdQVGowSExsaUxJbHhXN3h2U3JiQlZrTEZzOXJhbG55ZHJNYTUwaUxlc3pnNm12YVptcm5qMmtkdmUzdmdaNHBmT0w3VGc</guid></item><item><title>R.F.K.

	Richard Eby knew things were getting bad when the schools shut down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Eby is a family medicine doctor based in Andrews, in West Texas. It’s a quiet town of 14,000, chock full of all-American touches — a Buffalo Wild Wings sits a few doors down from La Hacienda, a bottomless Mexican buffet with neon cacti on its facade and brightly colored &lt;em&gt;papel picado&lt;/em&gt; strung across its interior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Like many other towns nestled in Texas’ Permian Basin — of &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights &lt;/em&gt;fame — it is also unapologetically high-school-football-crazy: Andrews High School’s astroturfed Mustang Bowl, capacity 8,000, sits at the northwestern border of Mustang Drive, which forms a necklace around town. (The Mustangs, who have a long legacy of district championships tracing back to 1953, went 5-7 last year — though they refused to go down without notching three blowout wins against district rivals.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Come last January, there were new whispers around town. Eby had heard from colleagues that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; was circulating in Gaines County, 30 miles north. And by the end of the month, he’d seen a few cases himself.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That was, in some respects, to be expected. After a 2019 outbreak in West Texas, a couple more confirmed cases in the South in 2023, and given that neighboring counties’ school districts have some of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state —13 times the national average — Eby has gotten used to keeping the potentially life-threatening virus on his radar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s always at the back of your mind,” he says.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But it wasn’t until some local schools started shutting down in the ensuing weeks that Eby realized how bad this outbreak could get. Something felt off to the pediatrician — he says that, at the time, he recalls the official case count being a dozen. “That just tells you how far undercounted the cases were,” Eby says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the months that followed, more than 750 measles cases were diagnosed — 414 in Gaines County alone. Ninety-nine patients were hospitalized for severe symptoms such as inability to breathe and inflammation in the brain. Two otherwise healthy, stone-cold-normal children died.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To pediatricians like Eby, the outbreaks meant every typically innocuous symptom in clinic — every cough or sniffle, every hive or wheal or welt — put him and his staff on high alert. That’s because measles can start as just a stuffy nose and a red dot on the abdomen, but the illness rapidly evolves into whole-body bumps and blisters accompanied by difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it produces a child so sleepy they can’t be woken up, or seizures that won’t stop, because of swelling in the brain. And it can all happen within days of the itch starting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	So, Eby hasn’t been taking chances. “All of a sudden, a same-day appointment that’s on the schedule as a cough and rash,” he says, “you need to ask, ‘Did anyone clarify?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That style of medicine — the kind where a previously largely-forgotten foe was now lurking in the community, in the waiting room, and in doctors’ minds — also felt a bit like a step back in time, Eby says. At various points during the outbreak, he found himself thinking, “Is every kid going to have measles for the next couple weeks?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That style of medicine is also becoming the norm, and not just in Texas. Even as attention has turned elsewhere — shutdowns, boat strikes, Epstein — the measles outbreak continues to rage throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As of Dec. 2, almost 2,000 cases have been confirmed across 43 states. (The Centers for Disease Control is not publicly sharing the number of so-called probable cases — ones that were not tested. During previous international outbreaks, between 10 percent and 70 percent of cases were not tested.) That number is the highest in the United States since 1992. And after a summer lull, cases are climbing again: The week before Thanksgiving, the number of cases was the highest since May.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Should the spikes continue into January, the U.S. will lose its “measles-free” designation from the World Health Organization — a label achieved in 2000. That’s part of a larger trend: In November, the WHO stripped the Americas of its measles-free label amid historic outbreaks in both Canada and Mexico. (Mexican officials say their outbreak was seeded from Texas; Canadian officials say theirs started with an “internationally imported” case, but did not specify whether it was American.)

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“This loss represents a setback,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, the region’s WHO oversight body, said of removing the measles-free label. “We call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccination/" id="auto-tag_vaccination" data-tag="vaccination"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases. Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To some domestic public health officials, the issue isn’t just that the outbreaks are a step backward. It’s that they’re entirely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Life has enough curveballs and trauma that to have a tragedy like someone passing away from a completely preventable disease — that’s just hard to believe,” James McDonald, pediatrician and commissioner of the New York Department of Health, says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s not just measles. Cases of whooping cough increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, above pre-pandemic highs. Hospitalizations from flu this past year were at the highest rates in more than a decade. In 2024, almost 4,000 infants were born with syphilis infections — a figure eight times higher than the 2015 number. “We’re still dealing with things that First World nations shouldn’t even be talking about,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But under the current Trump administration, health officials say, it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under them — from under public health, as an institution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There have been the obvious, explicitly damaging measures. Take, for instance, the administration’s all-out assault on vaccines, which most recently, in early December, led the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to nix the decades-long recommendation to immunize all newborns against hepatitis B. The same day, a presidential memo directed Department of Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to “review best practices” related to vaccines and update the childhood immunization schedule accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There have also been less obvious measures. Billions of dollars in cuts to the CDC, buried in the fine print of federal budgets. Billions more public health dollars to states clawed back, hidden in cases winding their way through the federal courts. Mass layoffs to the epidemiologists, and lab workers  and data collectors responsible for responding to, diagnosing, and tracking disease outbreaks in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Taken together, experts worry that the steps to hamstring the CDC (and other state departments) have imperiled the public’s health for political purposes. These actions are “seeding doubt …[and] hijacking resources away from families…[with] significant consequences,” says Susan Kressly, pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the meantime, the measles outbreak is “continuing to grow,” she adds, “with no end in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 id="code-lavender" class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-primary-l   "&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Code Lavender&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Somewhere in Lubbock, Texas, stashed away in the corner of a hospital closet, there’s a cart stocked to the teeth with lavender-scented products. There are rollerballs and brushes. There are sachets and steamers. There are lavender-colored journals and pens, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The cart — and the team of counselors, chaplains, peer coaches, and therapy dogs that accompany it — was borne out of necessity during the Covid pandemic, says Shannon Bates, chief nursing officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital. The goal, she says, was to use aromatherapy, reflection, dialogue, and community to combat the “secondary trauma response” associated with death after death from that virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For a while after the height of the pandemic, the cart got less mileage. But during the measles outbreak, the Covenant team has been pulling it out again. That’s partially because, in some ways, the script has flipped on clinical staff. With the unavoidable, politically charged conversations around vaccines that accompany the outbreak, “it’s kind of the opposite of Covid, where everyone was the health-care hero,” Bates says. “Now, you’re seen as the bad guy, the one who can’t be trusted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s also because, in addition to staff enduring rhetoric around health workers that’s ranged from distrust to resentment, they’ve witnessed firsthand just how harmful the measles outbreak can be. In February, a six-year-old girl died after being admitted to Covenant — the nation’s first death from the outbreak. That “definitely has taken a toll on staff,” Bates says. Since then, she adds, “we have done some proactive rounding.” In other words, rather than waiting for someone to ask for a rollerball or a sachet, they’ve taken to roaming the halls with the cart, the chaplains, and the puppies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Summer Davies also recalls the start of the outbreak, when the first call came in. It was the early afternoon, just after the team finished rounding. Davies, a pediatrician and associate professor at Texas Tech University, was patched through to a doctor who told her the child had a fever, and a rash, and needed to be admitted precautionarily. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘I don’t know, maybe it’s not measles,’” Davies says. That changed within moments of seeing just how sick the child was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Davies was there when the six-year-old died, too — an experience she calls “devastating.” The death stuck with her: Long after it happened, she and her colleagues wondered, “Could we have done something different to help that child?”

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Amid the circumstances, Davies says her hospital, as well as the county and state public health departments, was incredibly supportive. “We have had people…advocating for us, taking all of the right steps, making sure we’re safe and that patients are safe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Off the wards, though, things were harder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As the outbreak raged, federal agencies&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; ignored pleas for help&lt;/a&gt; from Texas officials. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, wrote in emails obtained by &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; just days after&lt;/a&gt; children with measles started getting hospitalized. “We weren’t allowed to do anything,” a CDC official told &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;. It took weeks until any agency officials dispatched to Texas — at which point HHS pressured them to highlight Vitamin A, rather than vaccines, as a solution to the outbreak. (In multiple interviews since January, Secretary Kennedy has claimed that Vitamin A can reduce measles deaths. Studies have consistently found that the salve demonstrates no effect in the greater than 99 percent of Americans who have adequate levels of the vitamin.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“As a health-care professional, that’s scary to hear,” Davies says of being all but abandoned by the federal government. “[But] it makes a big difference to feel supported by your hospital system,” she adds, “to know that they’re in our corner, if nobody else is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Then there are the anti-vax politics — including &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;baseless allegations&lt;/a&gt; made by Robert Malone, a pathologist turned biotechnology executive, on his personal Substack. Malone’s influencer era kicked off in part thanks to a 2021 Joe Rogan interview in which he claimed, without evidence, that antacids cured his case of Covid and that the vaccine could cause narcolepsy. When it came to measles, he claimed that the two deaths from measles were the hospitals’ fault, the result of “medical mismanagement” rather than anything to do with vaccination. Those allegations were never refuted by the administration. And two months after they were posted, Secretary Kennedy appointed Malone as vice chair of the CDC vaccine advisory committee. “It’s impossible not to read some of those comments,” Davies says. Since then, though, she’s tried to stop reading the news.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Despite it all, Davies and her colleagues have pressed on. “We’ve really had tunnel vision: Let’s take care of our patients and do our job, boots on the ground,” she says. And on Aug. 18, the Texas outbreak was declared over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	While that means Covenant’s staff can breathe a little easier — for now — in hindsight, Davies says, “it makes it even harder to know [that] this could have been prevented.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Likewise, her experience has made her fear for colleagues across the country. “With the nature of the disease and the high mortality rate from it,” Davies says, “more kids will die.”&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 id="purposeful-chaos" class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-primary-l   "&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;‘Purposeful chaos’&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Across the country, Davies’ compatriots are steeling themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist at University of Kansas Medical Center, every child with a cough is “very high stakes” right now. “It’s only a matter of time” until an outbreak happens in his state, too, Hawkinson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Alexandra Cvijanovich, pediatrician at Presbyterian Medical Group in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in today’s environment, “well child checks aren’t always well child checks.” Cvijanovich isn’t leaving any stones unturned: “I always worry: When am I going to have a child in my waiting room who has measles?” she says. The level of vigilance is in part from a deadly measles case she saw during residency that she described as  “the worst death of my pediatric career.” The current outbreak, Cvijanovich says, “has brought back all those memories.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	And to Douglas Fleck, pediatrician and medical director of quality at University Hospital Rainbow Babies &amp;amp; Children’s in Ashtabula, Ohio, even figuring out where to put sick patients is “straight-up a challenge.” Fleck doesn’t want to put them in the waiting room because “we take an oath to do no harm,” he says. But he also doesn’t want to turn them away, since that could lead patients who already distrust the health-care system to become even more entrenched. As a result, “we’re dusting off the Covid playbook,” Fleck says — doing as much as they can by telehealth, triaging patients in the parking lot, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Try as they may, all three doctors know their clinics may need help should things get out of hand. But ever since the first days of Trump’s second term, whether counties and states will have the resources to do so remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	One of the earliest threats came on March 24, when HHS summarily terminated $11 billion  in funding to states under the premise that those dollars, initially granted during Covid, were “no longer necessary…now that the pandemic is over,” according to a notice issued by the agency. That “immediately triggered chaos for State and local health jurisdictions,” according to an April 1 lawsuit brought by nearly two dozen states against HHS and RFK Jr. In May, a district court judge ruled in favor of the states; by July, HHS had appealed that ruling. As of this writing , the case continues to snake its way through the courts.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to Sameer Vohra, pediatrician and director of the Illinois Department of Health, HHS’ logic is nonsensical. All the public health measures required to combat Covid — promoting vaccination, purchasing essential equipment, expanding labs, conducting contact tracing, assisting localities during outbreaks — serve as “infrastructure to allow us to be prepared for future emergencies as well,” Vohra says. His state saw nearly $500 million disappear overnight, $125 million of which had already been allocated. “This will have a debilitating impact,” Vohra says , should the federal government win its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In New York, commissioner McDonald is reckoning with similar whiplash. In the immediate aftermath of the clawback, they laid off the majority of contract employees needed to support the department’s efforts. Other states, like Utah and Maine, likewise were forced to fire dozens of employees — further intensifying public health workforce shortages that the federal Government Accountability Office, in January , described as so severe as to threaten the nation’s ability to “conduct key public health functions…[and]respond to emergencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Nationally, public health is really being threatened,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Simultaneously, at the federal level, HHS — the backstop for states in situations of crisis — is roiling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In late March, HHS slashed over 10,000 jobs, closed half its regional offices, and shuttered entire divisions, like those responsible for ensuring workplace safety standards, monitoring levels of environmental toxins, and supporting children with birth defects. National databases upon which public health departments, researchers, and clinicians depend are also fading to black as the data collectors are fired. Some of the gold-standard labs responsible for performing testing on illnesses like measles were shuttered, smack in the middle of the measles outbreak. And the disease detectives responsible for on-the-ground response in places like Texas were gutted, too. Which is perhaps in part why Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, heard crickets in response to her pleas for help in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It is unheard of that, in an active outbreak, [CDC] just says, ‘No…we’re not going to send people,’” Demetre Daskalakis, physician and former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says. “[But] I don’t know who’s left.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“[They] are paralyzing the organization,” Daskalakis adds in reference to the federal government’s actions. “It is purposeful chaos.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For doctors like Fleck in Ashtabula, it’s hard not to notice all of this — or, what it means about how the administration sees public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s hard to feel we’re being supported,” Fleck says. “Actions speak louder than words…and I think there are a lot of actions that they’re taking that raise a red flag.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Still, Fleck will keep seeing the kids with the fevers, the coughs, the rashes. He’ll keep juggling the safety of that child with the others in the waiting room. And, even as it seems the scales are increasingly tilted against him, he’ll keep doing what he does. Because, for kids’ sake, there’s no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Day by day,” Fleck says, “patient by patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;The research, published in the &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343"&gt;journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed dietary habits and health outcomes among tens of thousands of people and found that those who regularly consumed high-fat cheese were less likely to develop dementia than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Researchers examined data from more than 27,000 participants and found that people who consumed high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of all-cause dementia.

Low-fat cheese, low-fat cream, and other low-fat dairy products showed no significant association with dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Researchers also observed that participants who consumed more high-fat cheese tended to have a lower prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, and were less likely to use lipid-lowering medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She noted that the study focused on a Swedish population, where cheese is more often eaten on its own rather than as part of heavily processed meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Experts emphasized that while the findings are notable, high-fat foods should still be consumed in moderation due to their potential impact on cholesterol and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 224 people are in quarantine amid an outbreak that has sickened 144 people. Most are unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, or CHD, which Kennedy led from&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Kennedy,as%20an%20afterthought." data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 2015&lt;/a&gt; to 2024, produces a daily stream of articles and videos stoking fear about vaccines and falsely suggesting that the risks associated with vaccine-preventable diseases are exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the height of the South Carolina outbreak this month, when more than 200 people were in quarantine, CHD published an article circulating anti-vaccine tropes and arguing that criticism of Kennedy over the spread of measles was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The article says CHD’s chief scientific officer “questioned whether measles needs to be prevented in the first place”. It quoted the host of a CHD.TV show saying it was “absurd” to blame Kennedy for outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CHD did not respond to a Guardian request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As measles spread through the US this year, Kennedy has made statements that undermined confidence in the measles vaccine and the public health response, experts said. In one interview with CBS, he said “people should get the measles vaccine”, but then raised concerns &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/o2U0csKvqMY?t=553" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about whether it was adequately safety-tested&lt;/a&gt;. In an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HVk-14n-VRE?t=2020" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;appearance in Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, he said the vaccine waned in effectiveness and was “leaky”, and suggested the case counts in the US were not so bad, compared with larger numbers overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR,97%25%20effective%20against%20measles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, is 97% effective. Most people do not experience side-effects and those that do occur are usually mild, like a fever or soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HHS and CDC continue to support strong measles containment through active monitoring and coordination with state and local health departments,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy, said in an email, adding that the US was faring better than Mexico and Canada in its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective protection against measles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said the article published by CHD this month was just the latest example of how the group was working off a familiar anti-vaccine playbook to defend Kennedy, downplay the dangers of disease and exaggerate the risks of vaccines – making it seem that it was worse to get vaccinated than to get sick, when the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These kinds of posts served multiple purposes, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine law expert at UC Law San Francisco, who has tracked CHD and Kennedy for years. They were trying to convince themselves and people on the ground that measles was not so bad, while also defending Kennedy and themselves, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nobody wants to believe that they’re hurting children,” Reiss said. “They will be blamed for this, and they will be rightly blamed for this, because most of the cases are in the unvaccinated and they have been promoting anti-vaccine misinformation for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said Kennedy’s leadership had hurt efforts to contain measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even if he’s not responsible for the actual start of the outbreak, he is most certainly responsible for the spread of the outbreak,” said Amy Pisani, CEO of the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not the first time CHD has mobilized this year around an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year, CHD encouraged people not to get vaccinated and traveled there to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;produce videos&lt;/a&gt; saying measles wasn’t so dangerous. “Measles is not a grave threat to America’s children,” Mary Holland, chief executive officer, said in one article. It also published videos, articles and social media posts suggesting that the people who died of measles died of something else. Kennedy later echoed CHD’s assertions, suggesting that one child’s death &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263#:~:text=He%20said%20the,two%20weeks%20before.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;may have been caused by some other reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She got over the measles, according to her parents, and according to the medical reports, I saw a report on it today, the thing that killed her was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection,” he told CBS News. He told Fox News her death was caused by pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pneumonia is one of many possible &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31490?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOw7CVleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFIbnYyYmtEZGp3bXgzTGNXc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHkxc2DG-fVqPatJsatp4v9fzapThbI32mxsh5PoW4PeLNsqAJVvKvVaSEs6d_aem_CRs2YmnIynERUz7ACplVbw#:~:text=Other%20measles%20symptoms%20may%20include%20small%20spots%20in%20the%20cheek%20area%20inside%20the%20mouth%2C%20diarrhea%20and%20ear%20infection.%20Measles%20can%20lead%20to%20pneumonia%2C%20swelling%20of%20the%20brain%2C%20deafness%2C%20intellectual%20disability%20and%20death." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complications of measles&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Those false assertions become a distraction from the reality that vaccines can help keep children alive and protected from disease, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The group’s work is notable at a time when a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/cdc-social-media-silence-during-2025-measles-outbreak-left-void-filled-news-media-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found what researchers called an emerging online “health communication void” around measles. They said the CDC had posted just 10 times about measles across three social media platforms between January and August, far less than the average of 45.8 posts during that time frame in the past four years. From 2021 to 2024, 82% of posts promoted routine or “catch-up” measles vaccination, but not a single post from 2025 emphasized routine vaccination, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By contrast, they found CHD posted 101 times about measles on X alone during the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In South Carolina, 18 more people have been reported infected since 12 December. State health officials said this week that children from four schools remained in quarantine, and some would be quarantined until 2 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMXliTjl5X3dCejQ5UVNzTnhXXzVJa3FfSURhUTFzOTE5VVJZdlBTdWkzQ3pCOEVVRURsazdlcXhLSEhEb2JoNUcycU00d2xVTElyRTFINVE5SUR3QWV2WEdLMXdtYVZncnFoY21vS0hxNjI1cS1CcDhDdWRXQUlZSGJGYUtWcGppS0R2LW4wNEhnREpG</guid></item><item><title>大约90%的人报告器官移植后的性格变化–为什么？ - IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/around-90-percent-of-people-report-personality-changes-after-an-organ-transplant-why-81969</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strange phenomenon that’s gaining doctors’ attention is the way in which &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/iflscience-we-have-questions-can-transplants-change-your-personality-80631" target="_blank"&gt;organ transplants can change your personality&lt;/a&gt;. A particularly &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-donor-organs-transfer-memory-heart-transplant-patients-report-strange-personality-changes-77153" target="_blank"&gt;unusual case study&lt;/a&gt; involved a woman who, having lived a mostly vegetarian life, found herself suddenly drawn to Kentucky Fried Chicken after receiving a donor heart from someone who loved nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taste changes have been reported among people receiving bone marrow transplants, too, such as the person who went from hating pickles to loving them, and another who switched from white wine to red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transplant changes aren’t limited to dietary preferences, either. People have reported a change in preferences for everything from food to music, art, and sexual orientation. So, why might that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a phenomenon &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/health-and-medicine/about-us/people/adam-taylor" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, Professor and Director of the Clinical Anatomy Learning Centre at Lancaster University, UK, has questions about, too. Writing for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-an-organ-transplant-really-change-someones-personality-228923" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, he explains how the placebo effect could be a contributing factor as the overwhelming joy of getting a second shot at life leads to a fresh perspective. There is, however, reason to believe that some of these changes could run deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a new part – say a heart transplant – your donor heart might produce 20 percent more of something like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or it might be more susceptible to the ANP that's circulating in your body already, so your resting heart rate goes up because your physiology is adapting and changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that donor organs are capable of influencing what’s going in the body for many people,” Taylor told IFLScience. “People report these personality changes (sometimes not a complete personality change but little changes) and it's feasible that – because of a transplanted organ – you are going to have changes in your physiology, and those changes in physiology then influence other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality changes have been reported among heart transplant patients, which is a particularly interesting organ to consider. There’s the capacity for a kind of placebo effect, as many cultures consider the heart to be more than just a big pump, forming a part of who we are from bravery to our capacity to love (“she had a heart of stone,” etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart is also a great candidate for altering our physiology, however. Its chambers release peptide hormones that work with our kidneys to regulate fluid in the body, but it can also influence our hypothalamus, acting on our "&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-actually-is-fear-find-out-more-in-issue-39-of-curious-out-now-80703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fight or flight&lt;/a&gt;" response and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fn7qhAxPCKs??si=ibI62NXvAC3aAxRO&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the brain requires exposure to various hormones and signalling molecules,” said Taylor. “If you get a new part – say a heart transplant – your donor heart might produce 20 percent more of something like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or it might be more susceptible to the ANP that's circulating in your body already, so your resting heart rate goes up because your physiology is adapting and changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example Taylor gives is that of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antidepressants-all-you-need-to-know-from-serotonin-to-psychedelics-73941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; – often touted as the “happiness molecule”. Most people think it’s all about the brain, but in truth, the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut and it has a systemic effect across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early studies are reporting somewhere in the region of 90 percent of people who undergo organ transplantation notice a change in personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be said that no organ is an island, and our constituent parts are as interconnected and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/social-frailty-is-a-strong-predictor-of-dementia-but-two-ingredients-can-put-the-brakes-on-cognitive-decline-81659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;interdependent&lt;/a&gt; as we are. It would almost be more surprising, then, if it were possible to replace an organ without noticing some kind of change in your body and in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve a lot still to learn about how much of these self-reported changes are rooted in physiology, or if certain organs are more likely to result in personality changes than others. But with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/organ-transplants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;organ transplants&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, early research suggests we’re going to have a lot more data to work from going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's absolutely something that requires more investigation,” said Taylor. “The problem is that so many more people are now [experiencing this phenomenon] that we're only just beginning to get enough [data] to be able to look at it, but it's definitely a thing.

                &lt;p&gt;When you picture nuclear disasters, you probably envision Chernobyl and Fukushima, but the worst nuclear accident in American history actually occurred in the hills outside Los Angeles in the summer of 1959. An experiment caused a meltdown at the nuclear reactors at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, spewing up to 300 times the radiation as the famed Three Mile Island incident. Six decades later, the environmental and political fallout of the Santa Susana disaster continues to plague the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), formerly known as Rocketdyne, is a testament to the innovation that defined America's post-war period. Even after the 1959 disaster, the plant continued to operate until 2006. Despite these operations, clean up has been severely lacking. Environmental advocates have pointed to the field's pollution as a prime example of the government's inability to protect communities. The field's new corporate owners, however, have largely brushed off these worries as overblown, and are looking to transform the former nuclear site into a nature reserve. Activists argue, however, that the move actually does more to ease the company's cleanup burden due to lower decontamination requirements, thus preserving the site's toxic pollutants rather than removing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disaster is a key example of the pitfalls plaguing &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1945647/big-tech-nuclear-energy-ai-data-centers/" target="_blank"&gt;America's growing nuclear energy sector&lt;/a&gt;. Featuring clandestine military research, blatant cover-ups, and a cleanup process languishing in bureaucratic limbo, this story reads like a movie script. In fact, the disaster spurred an award winning documentary, "&lt;a href="https://www.inthedarkofthevalley.com/" target="_blank"&gt;In the Dark of the Valley&lt;/a&gt;." Sixty years after the meltdown, Santa Susana poses critical questions regarding government transparency, corporate accountability, and environmental protection laws, particularly as the &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1985493/next-gen-nuclear-reactors-coming-us-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;United States continues to explore the efficacy of next-generation nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;The Santa Susana meltdown was an epic disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On Monday, July 13, 1959, workers in the infamous Area IV section of the SSFL noticed the reactor was experiencing extremely high temperatures. Fearing a runaway reaction, the scientists undertook extreme cooling measures, plunging the reactor's control rods into the core and venting radioactive gas to alleviate the chance of explosion. Once temperatures cooled, the team brought the reactor back to life, unaware that it was still undergoing a mini-meltdown. Lacking modern containment structures,  plant scientists diluted the fission products with outside air before filtering them through a ventilation system, ultimately releasing an estimated 130–13,000 curies of iodine-131 and 260–2,600 curies of cesium-137 into the atmosphere. For reference, Three Mile Island only released 17 curies of iodine-131, making Santa Susana potentially one of &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-the-most-contaminated-nuclear-location-in-america/" target="_blank"&gt;the country's most contaminated nuclear locations&lt;/a&gt;. Critically, the wide range of these estimates underscores the lack of clarity scientists still have regarding the accident's scale and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelievably, news of the disaster didn't reach the public until 20 years later, when UCLA student Michael Rose discovered the Atomic Energy Commission's records, and subsequent cover up, of the accident. Over the next 50 years, at least three additional incidents occurred across is 10 nuclear reactors. The lab also emitted contaminants through its hot lab, a disposal facility where the country's nuclear fuel and reactor components were disassembled. Similarly, advocates later discovered the lab's plutonium fuel fabrication facility illegally burned contaminated reactor components in open air pits, releasing contaminants into the ever-nearing local community. The lab's tens of thousands of rocket tests caused millions of gallons of toxic chemicals to percolate into the site's soil and water, which stormwater runoff, wind, and other environmental factors have carried into the surrounding community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;Addressing contamination at Santa Susana&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scientists are split on the degree to which the site's toxins have negatively impacted local communities. For instance, a 1997 UCLA study found SSFL workers experienced severely elevated rates of radiation-related cancers and death, but was quickly contradicted eight years later by a Boeing-funded survey which found no significant linkage. Two years later, however, researchers at the University of Michigan discovered a 60% increase in certain cancers within two miles of the lab, while researchers at USC's Keck School of Medicine found no measurable evidence supporting the claim in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address potential contamination, California's EPA struck deals with NASA and the Department of Energy to cleanup the facility by 2017. Boeing, which now owns the site, declined to sign a similar agreement, and the state's deadline passed without decontamination efforts breaking ground. A year later, a nearly 100,000-acre wild fire which began at the lab site unearthed toxic waste in the field's soil, blanketing surrounding communities with radioactive smoke and spreading contamination over nine miles away.  Meanwhile, advocates have criticized the public authority tasked with holding the site's owners accountable for its cleanup, California's Department of Toxic Substance Controls, for enabling much of the site's toxic chemicals to remain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, CalEPA &lt;a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2022/pr05092022-dtsc-calepa-swrcb-ssfl.html" target="_blank"&gt;imposed&lt;/a&gt; stricter cleanup requirements for Boeing. In December 2025, the LA Water Board took steps toward holding Boeing accountable for these standards, seeking to fine Boeing nearly $600,000 over the site's contaminated stormwater runoff. The action comes shortly after an LA Superior Court ruled against the Boeing in its lawsuit challenging stricter contamination requirements for the site. Whether such measures spur a mass cleanup as the field transitions to a nature reserve remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

Researchers note that the effect is driven by the mental demands of controlling movement, rather than physical exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human perception of time rarely aligns perfectly with clock time. Everyday experiences, such as waiting in line or enduring a monotonous task, can feel longer than they truly are. Research has shown that physical activity, including cycling, walking, and running, can influence these distortions of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying mechanism has remained uncertain. Some scientists have argued that physiological changes, such as elevated heart rate or hormone release, are responsible. Others have proposed that cognitive factors, particularly the attentional resources required to manage complex movements, play a more significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Tommaso Bartolini from the Italian Institute of Technology, the research team sought to clarify whether distortions in time perception during running are primarily physiological or cognitive in origin. Running on a treadmill requires careful motor control, which may place additional demands on attention. By comparing running with other conditions that involve less physical effort but still require cognitive resources, the researchers aimed to isolate the source of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 22 participants (10 females), with an average age of 26. Each participant was asked to memorize a two‑second visual stimulus (a blue square displayed on a screen) and then judge whether subsequent stimuli lasted the same amount of time. This task was performed under four conditions: standing still (baseline), running on a treadmill at 80 percent of maximum heart rate, walking backwards on the treadmill, or standing still while performing a concurrent visual memory task (dual task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate was monitored throughout the running and backward walking sessions to measure physical exertion**, while it was recorded for one minute prior to the baseline and dual task sessions.** The researchers then analyzed the accuracy and precision of participants’ time judgments across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a consistent pattern. In all three experimental conditions (running, walking backwards, and the dual task) participants overestimated the duration of stimuli compared to the baseline. For example, during running, a stimulus lasting approximately 1.8 seconds was perceived as equal to the two‑second reference, representing an overestimation of nearly nine percent. Walking backwards and the dual task produced similar distortions of about seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these distortions did not correlate with changes in heart rate. Although running elevated heart rate substantially more than walking backwards, the magnitude of the time distortion was nearly identical. This strongly suggests that the effect is not driven by physiological exertion but by the cognitive effort required to control movement or divide attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, participants’ precision—i.e., the consistency of their judgments—remained stable across conditions. This indicates that while their perception of duration was biased, their ability to reproduce that bias reliably was unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartolini and colleagues concluded, “the results of the current study suggest that we should be very cautious in interpreting perceptual timing biases observed during physical activities as reflecting physiological alterations. The results also encourage the scientific community investigating time perception in ecological sensorimotor contexts to consider the potential confounding role of cognitive factors implicated in the execution of complex motor routines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some limitations are to be noted. For instance, the study focused exclusively on running and visual stimuli, leaving open questions about whether similar effects occur with other activities or sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-07814-9" target="_blank"&gt;The role of physical and cognitive effort on time perception&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tommaso Bartolini, Irene Petrizzo, Roberto Arrighi, and Giovanni Anobile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOVkdfZC1qRXY3UlBhRmplY1ZnakV3Mm5qM19SNlNaWkFNUTNMZzBEa3dlWXlLRWRVamdfYmRHWVEyOTdWSm41ajNIaHlScWdHbWQxdWlCQWx1ZzBHNjczV2pySTc1WXAwU0twV2FOR2VvQTJxM0Q4cVg3WGtPMV9uTW54MjVwUQ</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府实际上可能会对慢性病做一些好事--除非是小RFK。挡道-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/chronic-lyme-disease-rfk-jr-could-help-patients-or-could-be-a-disaster.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2bw2e007y2gkp0bvj1gfv@published"&gt;When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001u3b7blifp16jj@published"&gt;But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings/card/rfk-jr-i-did-probably-say-that-lyme-disease-was-a-bioweapon-uQVxXUN67wwWnw2nw93Y"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; Lyme disease was &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/may/16/tucker-carlson/was-lyme-disease-spread-as-a-bioweapon-no-that-the/"&gt;developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon&lt;/a&gt; in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001v3b7b4ig8marn@published"&gt;This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001w3b7bmbl9hznn@published"&gt;Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the &lt;em&gt;aftermath&lt;/em&gt; of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001x3b7bhl1gth1y@published"&gt;Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001y3b7byhiehniw@published"&gt;The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme &lt;em&gt;infection&lt;/em&gt;, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001z3b7bhqyxm23z@published"&gt;But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00203b7bzow664o1@published"&gt;But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00213b7bj8gtgrfi@published"&gt;“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00223b7b5wwtcrh4@published"&gt;It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/03/rfk-new-vaccine-policy-changes-maha"&gt;accordingly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00233b7bawmxfkhe@published"&gt;There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00243b7bgie6us9u@published"&gt;“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/durland-fish/"&gt;Dr. Durland Fish&lt;/a&gt;, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00253b7bgblr45w5@published"&gt;These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00263b7bs86fldy0@published"&gt;And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00273b7bk8m8hdat@published"&gt;“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00283b7b86mkgwoj@published"&gt;Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/defense-bill-directs-gao-to-probe-tick-conspiracy-promoted-by-rfk-jr/"&gt;slipped a provision&lt;/a&gt; in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/17/gop-lawmaker-thinks-rise-lyme-disease-is-due-secret-tick-experiment-scientist-squashes-that-idea/"&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.&lt;/p&gt;

As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/09/vaccine-covid-coronavirus-safety-fda/"&gt;deaths to the COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, connected both Tylenol and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/10/circumcision-tylenol-autism-rfk/"&gt;circumcision to autism&lt;/a&gt;, and linked &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/29/ssris-mass-shootings-science-rfk/"&gt;SSRIs to mass shootings&lt;/a&gt;. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002a3b7ba0ciyk17@published"&gt;The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002b3b7b30zuvel9@published"&gt;Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002c3b7bzej9xqvp@published"&gt;“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002d3b7bjg1tv8ct@published"&gt;Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002e3b7boma1oia8@published"&gt;Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002f3b7beqrac170@published"&gt;For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002g3b7b80rl10w0@published"&gt;Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002h3b7b89dqz06s@published"&gt;But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “He will do everything he can to try and prove that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"CDC ends recommendation for all US newborns to receive hepatitis B vaccine","elementId":"ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-cdc"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Testing established vaccines in a country with high rates of hepatitis B and a fragile health system “reeks of a neocolonialist attitude” and risks expanding global mistrust of the US and science, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00079/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; made an alarming claim: the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine caused death in young girls in Guinea-Bissau. It was published by a group of Danish researchers, including a married couple named Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But when Kennedy made his announcement in 2025, he did not mention a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X21007209" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from some of the same authors on the same topic finding completely different results, essentially nullifying the first study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is one example of their questionable research, which has drawn criticism from other researchers and journalists examining their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now those same researchers will be the ones carrying out the new study on hepatitis B vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. US funding will go to the &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;, led by Aaby and Stabell Benn, at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and Stabell Benn did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about the details of the five-year study, set to begin in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Babies in the randomized, controlled trial will or will not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Researchers will then compare early-life mortality, illness and development between the groups, according to the &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;award announcement&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the vaccine to all babies at birth, but Guinea-Bissau has struggled to roll out the shots to every newborn, instead &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.14045#:~:text=Examples%20of%20risk%2Dfactors%20of,Bissau%20between%202005%20and%202007." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; the dose at six weeks of age. The country has pledged to fill that gap and plans on recommending hepatitis B vaccines to all newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. “It’s highly unethical to choose to give a vaccine to some children but not others,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yamey noted: “There’s already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study does not appear to be looking at whether the vaccine is more effective at birth, which Jacobs said was “concerning” as “nowhere in this do they say that they’re going to study the efficacy of the vaccine itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the trial will examine whether there are “overall health effects” – not specific outcomes, such as preventing infection from the virus – when the shot is given at birth, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Bandim Health Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is not clear what the research question is. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He also questioned whether participants could truly give informed consent, given the ethical concerns about how the study is being conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Among adults, about 5% have a chronic infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39187275/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of toddlers in Guinea-Bissau, about 11.2% already had hepatitis B infection, which means not enough babies are getting the shots, said Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The priority should be to increase vaccination with the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and protect more babies from the risk posed by this virus,” Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US, recommending the vaccine at birth to all babies – not just those who appeared to be at risk of infection – caused rates among children to drop precipitously, from 20,000 to about 20 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The experts voiced concerns about how the study would take place. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; instead of the United States or Denmark, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Why on Earth is this study happening in a high-endemic setting where the birth dose matters the most?” Yamey asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Denmark, where only &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36221255/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three in 1,000&lt;/a&gt; people have the virus, the shot is not currently recommended at birth either, which means the same study could be conducted there. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it’s still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “It seems to say we don’t value your lives enough to continue to provide support overall, but we won’t hesitate to experiment with your population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is single-blinded, which means the patients will not know who got the vaccine and who didn’t, but the research team will – which can affect the way they collect and interpret the data. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. And the endpoints – “overall health effects” – are “very squishy”, which leaves the results vulnerable to manipulation, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red flags&lt;/a&gt; in Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has also &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they’re now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Because &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, children will bear the brunt of these decisions, Offit continued: “This breaks my heart. It really does. It’s hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm’s way by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPMklZRDZ3YzROa0xGdVdzQkJlLXA4U0hTV3F6S0pCSUZURTF0WFlvdUNpZ2ZUN3ZHQXNvaWlOZnRQV2dMYnlYaWFkSlQ0R1BIVEIwTDdLczRTRk1EX1ZsV05iMWpKSHduVjN4ZlF2WXZKLW1VeW0yRWg2SkU4TTgyRnJCdnhsaVA3THFNVkszSVpHRWpxRUE</guid></item><item><title>奶酪可能有助于避免痴呆症，建议对超过25年的2.7万人进行研究-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheese-may-help-stave-off-dementia-suggests-study-of-27k-people-followed-over-25-years/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Sweden found a link between eating more high-fat cream and high-fat cheeses and a lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia than those who consumed none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who ate 50 grams or more of high-fat cheese—containing more than 20% fat—had a 13% lower risk of dementia than those eating less than 15 grams daily, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No association was found for low-fat dairy products, butter, milk or fermented milk, which includes yoghurt, kefir and buttermilk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that the study, published in the journal Neurology, does not prove that eating high-fat cheese and high-fat cream lowers the risk of dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For decades, the debate over high-fat versus low-fat diets has shaped health advice, sometimes even categorizing cheese as an unhealthy food to limit,” said Professor Emily Sonestedt, of Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study found that some high-fat dairy products may actually lower the risk of dementia, challenging some long-held assumptions about fat and brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers analysed data from 27,670 people in Sweden with an average age of 58 at the start of the study. They were followed for an average of 25 years. A total of 3,208 participants developed dementia during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants kept track of what they ate for a week and answered questions about how often they ate certain foods during recent years. They also talked with researchers about how they prepared their food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical serving of cheese is one ounce. Of those who ate more high-fat cheese, 10% developed dementia by the end of the study. Of those who ate less, 13% developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, education and overall diet quality, the research team found that people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who ate less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, they found people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 29% lower risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/full-fat-cheese-linked-lower-risk-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; also found&lt;/a&gt; a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease among those who ate more high-fat cheese, but only among those not carrying the APOE e4 gene variant, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also compared people who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily to people who consumed none. After similar adjustments, researchers found that those who consumed high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia compared to those who consumed none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, observational studies that show links and associations are not considered useful unless the association reaches above 60%. In that sense, the value of the findings is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO CHEESE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="26 Years of Research Shows Cardiovascular Health in Dairy Lovers is Not Aversely Affected by Choosing Cheese" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheese-actually-reduces-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-provides-a-lot-of-health-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;26 Years of Research Shows Cardiovascular Health in Dairy Lovers is Not Aversely Affected by Choosing Cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthy user bias is a feature of observational studies that can affect the outcome. It describes a phenomenon whereby people who are willing to make one choice regarding their health are more likely to make others, and that as their potential effects become difficult to separate out of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, one would guess a study influenced by healthy user bias would find a negative association with cheese and cream, since those who eat no cheese or cream will usually be making that choice in conjunction with several others to try and improve health, such as exercise or a higher quantity of vegetables at meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Trendy Type of Norwegian Cheese May Stave Off Bone Thinning, Shows New Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/norwegian-cheese-may-stave-off-bone-thinning/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Trendy Type of Norwegian Cheese May Stave Off Bone Thinning, Shows New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who don’t focus on health in their lifestyle and diet choices won’t exclude cheese cream—an inference because they won’t make any other choices. The results, being counter-intuitive, make the study results compelling even if the association with dementia was small&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fermented foods like yogurt and kefir, generally eaten for health reasons, showing no association only adds to the curious direction the data took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team says further research is needed to explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy offers some level of protection for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE CHEESE NEWS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="First Ever Cheese Museum Opens in Paris: ‘It’s Gouda Brie a Delicious Visit’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-first-ever-cheese-museum-opens-in-paris-see-learn-and-taste-of-course/" rel="bookmark"&gt;First Ever Cheese Museum Opens in Paris: ‘It’s Gouda Brie a Delicious Visit’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that when it comes to brain health not all dairy is equal,” said Professor Sonestedt. “More research is needed to confirm our study results and further explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy truly offers some level of protection for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonestedt noted that in Sweden, cheese is often eaten uncooked, while in the United States, cheese is often heated or eaten with meat. She says it is important that studies also be conducted in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy, Jr., removed 17 members of the committee earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bagdasarian said that Michigan and more than a dozen other states now use the immunization schedules from the AAP and other national medical organizations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health experts across the country, including myself, are not in agreement with recent federal vaccine recommendations,” Bagdasarian said in a statement “For decades, vaccines have played a critical role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases and have led to the elimination of several diseases and significant reductions in illnesses and fatalities. As the state’s chief medical executive, it is my duty to protect and promote public health, and I find the vaccine schedule recommendations produced by the AAP and AAFP well-evidenced and based on rigorous review. This Standing Recommendation will help encourage vaccine accessibility and availability in Michigan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bashar Yalldo, the president of the Michigan chapter of the Academy of Family Physicians, said in a press release that children should also make sure to get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. It comes after Kennedy's committee voted to change guidance on the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Routine childhood immunizations, including the hepatitis B birth dose, are supported by decades of real-world data and an exceptional safety record. The MAFP encourages parents to follow evidence-based medical guidance and to speak with their family physician about protecting their newborns, families and communities," Yalldo said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bagdasarian wrote in the recommendation, “Employing these schedules will contribute to the advancement of the health of Michigan’s residents and prevent severe, potentially fatal, negative outcomes. I encourage health care providers, health care systems and health care payers to limit barriers to vaccine access where possible.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
