One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We really know that vaccines are the single most important public health intervention for preventing infectious disease," Harrington said.

Kennedy Jr. will direct federal health agencies to explore potential new treatments for the disease, including vitamins, according to an H.H.S. spokesman. The decision is the latest in a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/health/kennedy-vaccines-confidence-access.html" title=""&gt;series of actions&lt;/a&gt; by the nation’s top health official that experts fear will undermine public confidence in vaccines as an essential public health tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The announcement comes as Mr. Kennedy faces intense backlash for his handling of the outbreak.

When he struggled to perform in the bedroom, she got him to take Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing being labeled a 'sex addict', she avoided discussing it with friends — but quickly started to feel isolated, and became depressed, and then suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After seven years, she ended the relationship and filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14640391/FDA-effects-hair-loss-drug.html"&gt; sold by telehealth companies &lt;/a&gt;for as little as $30 for a month's supply, with doctors saying it can prevent hair loss with little more than a pill a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thammika Songkaeo has revealed how finasteride destroyed her marriage, saying it left her ex-husband with low libido and erectile dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug was originally developed for men with an enlarged prostate, but it has since become a popular hair loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 2.6million men in the US take the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by blocking the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a compound thought to cause hair loss by shrinking hair follicles on the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But DHT is also crucial for sexual arousal, erectile function, and genital tissue health, and its reduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the drug shows a remarkable ability to promote hair growth, some men pay a steep price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some say the drug ruined their sex life, genitals and relationships — even long after they stopped taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo's husband was prescribed the drug by an unnamed health clinic and took it before they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe he was suffering from post-finasteride syndrome,&lt;span&gt; a condition of persistent sexual, neurological, physical and mental adverse reactions in patients after they take finasteride to treat hair loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her experience inspired her to write a book about a woman stuck in a marriage with an asexual husband in Singapore, titled: &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.penguin.sg/book/stamford-hospital/"&gt;Stamford Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. It was launched in the US on April 15 this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, Songkaeo said her husband told her he was suffering from side effects of the drug after they became a couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We noticed... that there was something off about the physical intimacy,' she said. 'There just wasn't the amount or intensity that there would be in my experience of a relationship.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She revealed the damage it had caused on the YouTube channel Moral Medicine, where patients who say they were harmed by finasteride publish their stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I thought it was something that could be overcome, as in I did not think it would be a lifelong thing — and from what I understood from my ex-partner there was no way for him to know if it would be a lifelong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought, "maybe it will be ok. Maybe what it is will be ok ". It turns out, it was not ok.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple met on the East Coast, and initially dated there before moving to Singapore together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo said in an&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXnH0qZ30Y0&amp;amp;t=359s"&gt; interview with Moral Medicine &lt;/a&gt;— which raises awareness over harms caused by finasteride — that the couple tried Viagra to help with intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the birth of their daughter, she felt that what physical intimacy there was had now almost gone — and that there was just too little in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt extremely lonely at that point,' she told this website, 'I've never felt that kind of loneliness in my life and never knew loneliness like that could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like a loneliness that had no place on this Earth. It was very intense and harrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And became like something that I could not live with, because it became very intense and harrowing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Millich said that after taking finasteride his genitals shrunk, and he also suffered from serious mental health problems &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After speaking to her husband about their differences, the pair decided to amicably end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo said she experienced opposition from her family, who are from Thailand, when she revealed she was ending her marriage over intimacy problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But since the relationship was resolved, she and her husband have remained best friends — and now happily co-parent their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would never, however, re-enter the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride works by blocking the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT, which — according to the Cleveland Clinic — is typically found in the genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About two to three percent of finasteride patients experience side effects, doctors say — with the most common being problems getting an erection, less interest in sex and problems with ejaculation, such as little or no semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors tend to tell patients that these will subside after they stop taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giving other women advice on how to handle the issue, she said: 'Letting compassion for both people guide the conversation leads to the best results. A conversation that is led by love and understanding for both people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really don't think that people who suffer from post finasteride syndrome should be treated as anything other than victims of a very dangerous drug in terms of the side effects it can give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, I don't think that any partner needs to endure the effects as if they were inconsequential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I think that if both parties arrive at the conversation and carry the conversation with love, care, respect and empathy... even the way the relationship dissolves can become a beautiful part of a couple or ex-couple relationship.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:09:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQVF9MeTlMT05tUkdZZzJHWWNYZnF5dlJTeWZsbERETl9WaTVKUUtmTDZFNFE1MjRjWlpMWEU2SnFKOG9xS2p0eUpaOE5CWlNzQjJ0VDRVN0pYWlVmRHI1bjlxNGthbnpndmlGNzVjRHFGclRYbjlMakVSNGk4UDhBUlB2LU1acGdqSURCSDNhUVVEUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPZndNSzhLSlI4Z2tFMlJyMEJsUUJ3dVF6QnZOMnZZeTdBb0IyV2dfZXV3cEVmQmoxQ09XNV9jUzF0MUh6TldRMHNxRmNSdDRFSFBjdHJzLTNNLUNTNWotcHVVYzk0ZGpiRW9hcW9yd0JkUHA3ZE1jOWFjcGpfVFpmQ2tPTlZtYXdubXh1OXFQUnVJYUVRR2pF</guid></item><item><title>“我甚至不敢吃冰箱里的蔬菜” ：关注食品纯度的饮食失调--《卫报》 | ‘I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge’: the eating disorder that focuses on food purity - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNOXU5dFFkNUVDdXg4UklPenkwNjg4a1hfZmZ5ZW42QVpKcU5zajU2QWNJUmh3U0VoUmNxT1U1TmJ5TnAyZG9FWnZwSDNDNUVZYnhOTVpEemRfamdTVDh1ZXhPeTZxM21Oc0ZOb3NwZFJkYnk0NzhOWl9IUFJRNjg0NEkySWZZTDgz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Katie Lundgreen Urness’s struggles with disordered eating began when she was just 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A gymnast, she put a lot of value in being petite.

Urness’s hard-won recovery was driven by her dream of motherhood – she knew she wanted a baby and worried it “would suffer and not develop right because I was restricting food”, she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Urness became pregnant at 25, her relationship with food was the healthiest it had ever been. Soon, TikTok and Instagram began serving her motherhood wellness content, even though she hadn’t searched for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One common theme was food purity. Posts warned against the “dangers” of common grocery items – that there was high-fructose corn syrup in most baby formula and harmful levels of pesticides in a box of cereal (&lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/high-fructose-corn-syrup-in-formula?utm_campaign=scarymommy&amp;amp;utm_content=TIMESTAMP_EPOCH&amp;amp;utm_medium=owned&amp;amp;utm_source=SOCIAL_NETWORK" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;both claims&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/no-your-cheerios-arent-filled-with" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have been debunked&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another theme: the corrupt medical system. “The content is telling you not to trust your doctor, saying the system is outdated and vicious, misogynistic,” says Urness.

By the time she delivered her son in 2023, she was obsessively fixated on the healthfulness, safety and purity of food. “I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge” because of pesticides, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I thought it would be safer for me to risk going back to restrictive food patterns to protect myself and my breastfed baby from all these bad things,” says Urness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to experts, anxious preoccupation with the safety and purity of food is a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36436144/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;form of disordered eating&lt;/a&gt; called orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Orthorexia nervosa was coined in 1997 by an integrative physician named Steven Bratman,” says Harrison, the dietitian. “He was seeing a lot of obsessive thinking about food and nutrition in his patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Being mindful about food isn’t inherently disordered – many people want to eat healthily. By contrast, “orthorexia can be defined as an obsessive and extreme fixation on food, like purity of food, healthfulness of food, cleanliness,” Harrison says. “It’s a very common way people can be disordered about eating,” she says. Chemophobia, an irrational, broad distrust of chemicals based in misinformation, is another common symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nonetheless, orthorexia remains under the radar. It is not yet listed in psychiatric classification systems such as the DSM-5, and can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from basic health-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Orthorexia can present on a spectrum and be harmful regardless of severity, explains Harrison. Severe orthorexia presents as a level of obsessiveness that can “interfere with people’s lives”, disrupting major factors such as social relationships and work, she says. It can lead to nutritional deficiencies, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921564/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;co-occur&lt;/a&gt; with body dysmorphia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not just healthy eating. It takes over your entire brain,” says Urness, who still considers herself orthorexic, but is working on recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that orthorexia is prevalent across genders, and that “the proportion of orthorexia nervosa symptoms seems to be increasing”. Men are more likely to frame restrictive eating around performance and fitness (think raw-meat diets and biohacking) and women around food-purity concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8a1d8d4c-1574-4dd0-b8b1-0c0f47cc684e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Orthorexia is politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.’&lt;/span&gt; Composite: Guardian/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Clinically significant orthorexia – cases where obsessive “healthy” eating causes impairment in daily life – is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26902744/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; in research studies. But the current literature does not capture what’s happening right now, says Danielle Shine, an Australian registered dietitian and PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation in social media, who is working with several clients in recovery from orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Social media is causing more and more people to develop disordered beliefs and behaviors” around food, says Shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 49% of Instagram users who followed health food-oriented accounts displayed orthorexia symptoms. Since then, short-form video platforms including TikTok have risen in popularity, supercharging the reach of alarmist food-purity content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;llison Hume, 40, an elementary school teacher and mother of two in Ontario, found herself acutely anxious about her and her family’s health and safety after a difficult second birth during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While rocking my new baby, I spent hours on social media,” she said. In particular, she consumed information from Hari and Bobby Parrish. Parrish, a creator without formal nutritional qualifications, has been criticized by &lt;a href="https://labmuffin.com/parabens-fragrance-colorants-talc-debunking-bobby-parrishs-tiktok-misinformation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chemists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E8ileCrLlY&amp;amp;t=20s&amp;amp;ab_channel=AndresAyesta" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dietitians&lt;/a&gt; for spreading alarmist misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These creators “made me feel safe at the time, because their information was so black-and-white”, says Hume. “They would say: ‘Stop eating x, y and z and you won’t get cancer.’ It felt comforting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hari has a “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodbabe/p/CGa3UTtFoC5/?hl=en" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;no-no list&lt;/a&gt;” that includes many common ingredients generally recognized as safe when consumed in typical amounts, including natural flavors, emulsifiers and MSG. Many of these additives are found in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ultra-processed-foods" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which the National Institutes of Health generally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8217149/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; everyone to eat less of due to their frequently high fat, salt and sugar content. But seeing these additives framed as outright threats, Hume began to fear them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She tossed all foods containing these “no-no” ingredients, and shopped exclusively at high-end natural food markets. This doubled her grocery spending, “which was a big financial strain”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f3d20915-4c22-4833-ba0a-e7b6ce66c0e0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"My secret life as a model: ‘High fashion loved me most when I was visibly bony’","elementId":"f3d20915-4c22-4833-ba0a-e7b6ce66c0e0","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/20/my-secret-life-as-a-model-high-fashion-loved-me-most-when-i-was-visibly-bony"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To check whether products contained forbidden additives, Hume used ingredient-scanning apps. If she had to purchase something “bad” because an approved item was unavailable, “it would be hard to sleep at night”, she says. “I really did think that our health was at stake if I didn’t follow these rules. The idea was that if we did get sick, it would be my fault and mine alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the time, she didn’t know there was a name for the obsessive, disordered thinking she was experiencing. “I was in denial that anything was wrong with me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But her family noticed huge mood changes. Hume became irritable and controlling. “I remember asking myself why everything was so hard,” she says. “Why aren’t other people following the same food rules? Why don’t they care about their health as much as I do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When she reflects on these habits now, Hume feels guilty. “It did end up affecting others around me as well, in particular my mom,” she says. “She also has a lot of health anxiety and it increased due to my influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, Hume is working with professionals to overcome orthorexia, and believes that content creators intentionally manipulate people like her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They are very aware of what they are doing. They are making a lot of money off vulnerable people like me … people like parents, the elderly and the chronically sick, and I really don’t think they care,” says Hume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the Covid-19 pandemic, trust in American health institutions has &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, creating fertile ground for wellness misinformation. In its place has risen a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/5g-coronavirus-and-contagious-superstition" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;conspiratorial digital ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/feb/27/how-anti-vax-parents-changed-their-minds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-science&lt;/a&gt; rhetoric promoted by figures such as RFK Jr – whose &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/13/rfk-jr-moms-health-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“Make America healthy again” (Maha) slogan&lt;/a&gt; has been adopted by his supporters, including a subset of self-described “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/her-voice-movement-jenny-donnelly-ziklag-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mama bears&lt;/a&gt;” who see themselves as family protectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If I’m nursing a baby and my brain is tired, it’s really easy to fall for these emotionally charged videos that are designed to target the ‘mama bear’ within me,” says Urness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alarmist Maha posts can trigger or perpetuate orthorexic behaviors in viewers, even if that is not the creators’ intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In food-purity culture, personal vigilance is the only safeguard against threats to health; sickness is caused by being lazy, ignorant and poisoning yourself.

But Maha mom creators also spread misinformation; in one viral post, a creator falsely claimed that propylene glycol – used as a food additive in salad dressing – was the same as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEnZgFnvIR2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;antifreeze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The underlying message of much Maha food content is that mothers must try to cook from scratch as much as possible, not just because it’s tasty or pleasant to do so, but because food in the US is inherently “dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet according to the 2022 &lt;a href="https://impact.economist.com/sustainability/project/food-security-index/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Food Security Index&lt;/a&gt;, the US ranks third in global food-safety standards, behind Canada and Denmark. “We have an incredibly safe food supply in the US in general. Historically, the FDA has done a pretty good job of keeping us safe,” says Harrison. “And I’m no apologist for the food industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My issue with it is that they’re using food as a way to try to entrap women and give up certain types of political and economical power,” Dr Alex Ketchum, a professor at McGill University’s Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies, whose work explores food and culture, says of Maha ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More domestic work means less time for community engagement, activism and ambitions. In her 1995 work Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body, philosopher Susan Bordo describes dieting as a form of self-deprivation that aligns with broader cultural narratives requiring women to limit their presence in the public sphere, both physically, by being smaller, and socially, by conforming to restrictive ideals. For Bordo, this shrinking is less about weight than about diminishing women’s agency and visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c645cebf-4655-4c0d-9d49-f1f40098f932" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":49,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Ozempic is hailed as a miracle drug.

It is also politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Holding citizenry in fear and making them anxious around food in particular is one of the ways authoritarian or totalitarian leaders exert their power,” observes Dr Emily Contois, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy of the 1920s-40s, says Contois, food became a political tool used to reinforce women’s roles in the home. The regime relied on women as domestic caretakers – what Contois calls “home-front civic engineers”. Mothers were expected to make do with food shortages, masking policy failures with their sheer force of labor as the government failed to provide basic care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;avigating the medical system can be frustrating for people with chronic illnesses who don’t feel like they’re getting satisfying answers from their doctors. The idea of experimenting with alternative paths to relief, like “cleaning up” one’s diet, can feel like a matter of survival. But attempts to get better can spiral into a harmful place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Anna Zambreny, 29, a Maryland-based healthcare recruiter, says she has spent at least six years with orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny cut out foods including gluten, dairy, eggs and meat while trying to heal various ailments, including eczema, Lyme disease and fatigue. The safest way to try eliminating food groups is with the help of a registered dietitian who can ensure adequate nutrition; Zambreny took advice from social media food-purity influencers and an allergist who recommended &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/wheat-belly-arguments-are-based-on-shaky-science-critics-say-1.2974214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientifically uncredible&lt;/a&gt; books like Dr William Davis’s Wheat Belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The idea that we weren’t being told the truth about food and that it was poisoning us started to affect my relationships. I didn’t really want to eat out … I didn’t really enjoy anything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny’s health symptoms progressed despite her efforts; now she reflects that many of them were likely rooted in self-inflicted malnourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I felt like everything I was eating could make or break my health,” she says. “I don’t think I was getting enough variety of food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Today, Zambreny feels angry and frustrated with the influencers she once trusted, some of whom she’s seen flip-flop on their messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They were vegan and then they’ve gone completely carnivore, or they were anti-medication and now they say getting on anxiety medication is the best thing that ever happened to them.

Although mood improves post-recovery, hidden deficits in reward processing and decision-making linger, potentially contributing to relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using computational models, researchers found that these individuals tend to opt for low-effort choices in daily scenarios unless strong rewards are guaranteed. These insights could help develop targeted treatments aimed at enhancing motivation and sustaining recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Motivation Lingers:&lt;/strong&gt; Even after recovery, effortful choices are often avoided unless rewards are large and certain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relapse Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Persistent motivational deficits may increase vulnerability to depressive relapse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target for Treatm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research shows that individuals who have recovered from depression are generally less willing to exert effort to pursue potential rewards compared to those who have never experienced depression, unless the rewards are large and highly likely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;, published by Elsevier, provides deeper insights into subtle motivational deficits that persist in individuals who have recovered from depression, potentially explaining relapse vulnerability and guiding targeted treatment for sustained recovery and overall patient well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have experienced depression in the past are often at a higher risk of experiencing another depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite improvements in mood after recovery from depression, they continue to exhibit some cognitive and motivational deficits, such as alterations in reward processing, impairing daily activities and functional recovery. The reasons behind this remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of the current study wanted to better understand the hidden processes in decision-making and motivation that might contribute to relapse vulnerability and identify ways to help people stay healthy after recovering from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator Diego A. Pizzagalli, PhD, formerly Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, now Founding Director, Noel Drury, MD, Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries, Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior &amp;amp; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Noel Drury MD Endowed Chair, University of California at Irvine, says, ”Imagine an everyday scenario: deciding whether to meet a friend after work or simply stay home because going out feels too exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with a history of depression might more often opt for the less effortful choice—staying home—missing out on rewarding experiences and social interactions. Over time, repeatedly choosing the low-effort path could unintentionally reinforce behaviors or thought patterns that increase the risk of falling back into depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research entailed asking individuals who had previously experienced depression (but have recovered and are not currently using medication) and a group of participants who had never experienced depression to make a series of choices between low-effort tasks with smaller rewards and high-effort tasks with potentially larger rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given evidence that antidepressants can blunt reward-related neural processes, only unmedicated individuals with remitted major depressive disorder were included to minimize potential confounding effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices were then analyzed using computational methods to understand motivation and decision-making. The most significant results showed that recovered individuals generally preferred less effortful options, but notably, they became equally or even more motivated than healthy individuals when rewards were large and highly certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that while motivation may be reduced in everyday tasks, providing clear and highly valuable incentives can effectively boost motivation in individuals with a history of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt; Cameron S. Carter, MD, University of California Irvine, notes, “Reduced motivation is a core feature of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Utilizing the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task test, researchers examined how individuals weigh the potential benefits of rewards against the cognitive or physical effort required to obtain them, providing valuable insights into motivational processes underlying major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this study suggest a nuanced picture of decision-making in recovered depression, highlighting conditions under which motivation may actually surpass typical levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Manuel Kuhn, PhD, Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, concludes, “This research is novel because it applies advanced computational modeling techniques, allowing us to identify latent decision-making processes—such as how reward magnitude and effort cost are integrated—that conventional analytical methods have not yet been able to uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important now, as it provides deeper insights into subtle motivational deficits that persist in individuals who have recovered from depression, potentially explaining their vulnerability to relapse triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By pinpointing these underlying motivational mechanisms, our findings can inform the development of more targeted treatments designed to enhance sustained recovery and overall patient well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and motivation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a626779676f6e636b4a6f66796f7c636f7824696567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elsevier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Leahy – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Computational Phenotyping of Effort-Based Decision Making in Unmedicated Adults with Remitted Depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego A.

Yet, the extent to which this deficit persists in remitted MDD (rMDD) remains unclear. Here, we examined effort-based decision making as one aspect of amotivation in rMDD using computational phenotyping to characterize decision-making processes and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmedicated adults with rMDD (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 40) and healthy control (HC) participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 68) completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated-measures analysis of variance and computational modeling—including hierarchical drift diffusion modeling and subjective value modeling—were applied to quantify decision-making dynamics in effort allocation across different reward magnitudes and probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to HC participants, participants with rMDD made overall fewer hard task choices, with an attenuated effect when accounting for anhedonia. However, specific to high reward, high probability conditions, participants with rMDD chose to expend effort more often than HC participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was supported by the drift diffusion model results revealing that participants with rMDD showed a drift rate biased toward selecting the easy task, counteracted by heightened influence of reward probability and magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probed with the subjective value model, this was not driven by group differences in decision strategies with respect to magnitude and probability information use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these findings suggest that while individuals with rMDD exhibit persistent motivational deficits, they retain a heightened sensitivity to high-value rewards, requiring more substantial or certain rewards to engage in effortful tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern may reflect impairments in reward processing and effort-cost computations, contributing to motivational dysfunction. Targeting reward sensitivity and effort allocation could be valuable for interventions aimed at preventing MDD relapse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:01:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9xR3U3Z3I2Wm05Z0dvUmE1MlhILXlUNm0tNm1md2tRTUZKZTlNVXJ5TzhlaUc5emllTTgtcTVRcEJnM1lhZkVxSnFOc3BkcnUwajFQNk9Qa1loR1VQcHBMdjJCZUNtV09RNEdzd0otMG5BdWZkcDM0</guid></item><item><title>有些苍蝇会失眠以抵御寄生虫- Ars Technica | Some flies go insomniac to ward off parasites - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPUmdNSVZVb0pNNWNwQjUtblVxeGlYTWJTWGxYaUpaalI0UktFY01ISHFTREFLWEV0VzJyRldUYjJGM3V4SDl6cTFtYXJfRGpvSVQ0dlF5ZmRqWXM3UXE1WXBSV1hTRWdtbjdQSGlNMGdZQy0tT2htX1NqZTBwYmJRZnpHaWhSanNLTkFPV3VYVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those genes associated with metabolism were upregulated, meaning they showed an increase in activity. An observed loss of body fat and protein reserves was evidently a trade-off for resistance to mites. This suggests there was increased lipolysis, or the breakdown of fats, and proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins, in resistant lines of flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parasite paranoia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depletion of nutrients could make fruit flies less likely to survive even without mites feeding off them, but their tenaciousness when it comes to staying up through the night suggests that being parasitized by mites is still the greater risk. Because mite-resistant flies did not sleep, their oxygen consumption and activity also increased during the night to levels no different from those of control group flies during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping mites away involves moving around so the fly can buzz off if mites crawl too close. Knowing this, Benoit wanted to see what would happen if the resistant flies’ movement was restricted. It was doom. When the flies were restrained, the mite-resistant flies were as susceptible to mites as the controls. Activity alone was important for resisting mites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mites are ectoparasites, or external parasites (as opposed to internal parasites like tapeworms), potential hosts like flies can benefit from hypervigilance. Sleep is typically beneficial to a host invaded by an internal parasite because it increases the immune response. Unfortunately for the flies, sleeping would only make them an easy meal for mites. Keeping both &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/fruit-flies-have-super-resolution-stereo-vision#:~:text=The%20team%20discovered%20that%20flies,surroundings%20than%20previously%20thought%20possible"&gt;stereoscopic eyes&lt;/a&gt; out for an external parasite means there is no time left for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pattern of reduced sleep likely allows the flies to be more responsive during encounters with mites during the night,” the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44323-025-00031-7?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oa_20250402&amp;amp;utm_content=10.1038/s44323-025-00031-7"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in their study, which was recently published in Biological Timing and Sleep. “There could be differences in sleep occurring during the day, but these differences may be less important as &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;sleeps much less during the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies aren’t the only creatures with sleep patterns that parasites disrupt. Evidence of shifts in sleep and rest in birds and bats has been shown to happen when there is a risk of parasitism after dark. For the flies, exhaustion has the upside of better fertility if they manage to avoid bites, so a mate must be worth all those sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;

Biological age, measured through biomarkers like lung function and cholesterol, reflects how the body’s systems are aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that individuals with higher biological age also showed brain changes, such as reduced gray matter, which are linked to dementia. Although the study does not prove causation, it suggests that slowing biological aging through lifestyle changes could reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Advanced biological age is linked to a significantly increased dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Changes Observed:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher biological age was associated with dementia-related gray matter loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Biological age can be influenced by diet, exercise, and healthy living habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People whose biological age is higher than their chronological age may be more likely to develop dementia than people whose biological age matches or is lower than their chronological age, according to a study published on April 30, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age is based on biomarkers of aging such as lung function, blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not prove that advanced biological age causes dementia; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109422"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of two people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dementia-biological-age-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also found that people with advanced biological age also had changes in their brain that are associated with dementia, such as loss of gray matter volume. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the rising impact of dementia around the world, identifying risk factors and implementing preventive measures is essential,” said study author Yacong Bo, PhD, of Zhengzhou University in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While none of us can change our chronological age, we can influence our biological age through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 280,918 participants in a United Kingdom database who were an average chronological age of 57 at the start of the study and did not have dementia at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were followed for an average of 14 years. During that time, 4,770 people developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used two methods to measure biological age. In addition to lung function, blood pressure and cholesterol, the methods measured other biomarkers in the blood, such as average cell volume and white blood cell count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These methods show how different parts of the body, like metabolism, immunity, liver, kidneys, heart and other systems, work together as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the people who later developed dementia had an average chronological age of 65 at the start of the study compared to 57 for those who stayed free of dementia, their average biological age was 55 by one of the methods, compared to 45 for those with no dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dividing the participants into four groups based on biological age, researchers found that those with the most advanced biological age were about 30% more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as age, education level and smoking status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that people with advanced biological age also had changes in their brain that are associated with dementia, such as loss of gray matter volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These brain structure changes explain some, but not all, of the association between advanced biological age and dementia,” Bo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results support the hypothesis that advanced biological age may contribute to the development of dementia by causing a widespread change in brain structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that participants in the database tend to be more health conscious than the general population, so they may be less likely to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by Henan Province and Zhengzhou city governments in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1062647563637d717e5071717e3e737f7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

health officials are sounding the alarm after confirming a measles case in an adult who recently attended a baseball game at Globe Life Field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Denton County officials, the unidentified patient was among a crowd of 39,244 people at the Texas Rangers vs &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-e23078a0-275b-11f0-9cbd-2f7dc6378ac8"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; Dodgers game on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient, whose vaccination status remains unknown, visited several locations between April 19-22 around Denton County and has now become the first case in the area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 800 cases of measles and three deaths from the disease have been reported this year, according to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-9615f1c0-1ac7-11f0-b736-177f0806b2d9" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and experts fear it could be the worst outbreak in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Texas alone, 663 cases of the disease have been recorded since January, out of which 87 have been hospitalized. Two unvaccinated girls, aged six and eight, from the state have also died from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It remains unclear whether the patient who attended the game is currently under hospital care or isolating at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since measles symptoms appear within seven to 14 days after contact with the virus, Denton County officials are asking locals in the county to monitor themselves for 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is transmitted through direct contact with airborne droplets that spread when a person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Without vaccination, it is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The unidentified patient was among a crowd of 39,244 people at the Texas Rangers vs Los Angeles Dodgers on April 19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If one person has measles, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average measles patient would infect up to 18 others if they were also not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had the original Covid strain, by comparison, infected on average just two people, though this number rose considerably with new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the locations the Texas patient visited include Guitars and Growlers restaurant in Flower Mound, a WalMart store in Lewisville, Rangers Republic at Texas Live! restaurant in Arlington and Pho Tay Do restaurant in Richardson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who develops symptoms is encouraged to immediately contact health services for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Matt Richardson, Denton County Public Health Director has since asked residents to ensure they are vaccinated in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted: 'Today's case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While we haven't linked this case to an existing outbreak, it highlights two realities: vaccines are important and if you have signs and symptoms, you should be tested.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC states that the best way to protect children and adults against measles is to get two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 93 percent effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97 percent effective after two doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles is transmitted through direct contact with airborne droplets that spread when a person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Matt Richardson, Denton County Public Health Director&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time the disease was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, the affected states are: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data suggests that 97 percent of the patients had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14568905/infants-die-whopping-cough-disease-vaccination-louisiana.html"&gt;not been vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against the virus, while one percent had received only one dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest number of cases have been reported in Texas and New Mexico, while Kansas and Ohio have also seen a mounting number of reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To date, there have been 884 confirmed measles cases reported by 33 jurisdictions, new CDC data shows.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three women have spoken openly about using weight loss medications, with the slimming results clearly visible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of male celebrities, Dr Green adds: 'Actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has also been open about taking Zepbound, another weight loss medication, which has led to increased sagging skin and jowls in the face after he lost a staggering 120lbs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic, along with similar drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy, is approved to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d3311cc0-2755-11f0-b076-a9400e4cbdee"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; but is widely used off-label for weight loss - especially among celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures from 2024, which are likely an undercount, suggest one in eight Americans have taken a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the growing concern about 'Ozempic mouth', Dr Green reveals that she has had an increasing number of patients asking about dermal &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fillers/index.html" id="mol-5fcb3700-26a8-11f0-8cff-2fcb153fa254" class=""&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; around the mouth area to help restore lost volume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert says that Ozempic depletes the subcutaneous fat. This is the visible fat layer just under the skin which you can pinch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By depleting the subcutaneous fat, the skin appears thinner, with more wrinkling and often lipstick lines,' New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Barry Weintraub told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fillers - gel-like substances injected beneath the skin to restore lost volume, smooth lines and enhance facial contours - can 'restore volume to the face, smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and plump the skin to create a more youthful-looking appearance,' Dr Green explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just as the number of people taking semaglutide (the active substance in Ozempic) has skyrocketed, the number of women using fillers has increased close to threefold in the US over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, 1.8 million filler procedures were performed, increasing to 5.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fxing Ozempic mouth can be an expensive task, with filler costing between $700 and $2,000 per syringe, depending on the location and provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another treatment Dr Green recommends as a fix is Thermage, which is a non-invasive radiofrequency treatment that uses heat to tighten skin and improve its appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Like many experts, Dr Green has noticed a number of celebrities suffering from Ozempic mouth as the result of taking weight loss drugs, with one of her standout examples being Whoopi Goldberg. Signs of Ozempic mouth include deep lines around the lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebel Wilson dropped more than 70lbs back in 2021 after turning to Ozempic, and she's committed to keeping the weight off. Sagging around the chin area is one sign of Ozempic mouth the experts point to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by stimulating collagen production, which helps to reduce wrinkles, improve skin laxity, and create a more youthful look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Green adds: 'As the body's collagen levels increase, the skin becomes firmer and tighter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, it takes four to six months to see results from Thermage, after which the results can last for approximately one and a half years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients on Ozempic should ideally undergo a Thermage procedure early in treatment or before treatment begins to prevent the development of loose, sagging skin on the face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But like filler, Thermage can be pricey, with the 30 minute treatment costing between $1,500 and $3,500. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To minimize the &lt;span&gt;aging effects on your smile and mouth due to Ozempic, Dr Green recommends 'consulting with your doctor about adjusting your medication dosage to prioritize gradual weight loss rather than rapid weight loss.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Ilana Ramer Bass of Mount Sinai Health System told this website she recommends eating 'small, well-balanced meals with a focus on fiber and protein' to help keep the skin hydrated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She adds: 'Before any skin conditions develop, causing wrinkles or dryness, I would also recommend seeing a dermatologist before turning to cosmetic surgery.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In terms of male celebrities, Dr Green says: 'Actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has also been open about taking Zepbound, another weight loss medication, which has led to increased sagging skin and jowls in the face.' Fierstein lost 120lbs in total thanks to weight loss medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic mouth is just the latest body part to be warped because of the rapid and drastic weight-loss turbocharged by Ozempic and similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon, previously told DailyMail.com a loss of fat can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fans speculated stars like Sharon Osbourne and Oprah Winfrey - both of whom have admitted to taking weight-loss dugs - were among the first to show signs of the surprising side effect deemed 'Ozempic feet'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ozempic face' has increasingly been seen on celebrities, who look gaunt with sunken eyes, hollow cheekbones and sagging faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katy Perry, Scott Disick and Jessica Simpson have all been labeled as suffering from the side effect after fans noticed their slimmed-down looks while the stars were out and about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the term 'Ozempic butt' has been coined to describe the deflated look of a person's buttocks after GLP-1 weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some users who have lost large amounts of weight said their backsides have now 'completely disappeared' and shrunk so much they can 'feel every bone'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some even said the problem was so bad they were constantly covering up their buttocks because they are self conscious of the way it looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 14:35:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>与心理健康障碍相关的免疫系统-神经科学新闻 | Immune System Tied to Mental Health Disorders -

Using Mendelian randomisation, scientists linked 29 immune-related proteins to seven neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting the brain is not the only organ involved in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20 of these proteins are targets of drugs used for other diseases, opening potential avenues for new treatments. These findings challenge long-standing brain-only models and point to mental health as a whole-body issue shaped by both brain and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Involvement Found:&lt;/strong&gt; 29 immune proteins linked to seven mental health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Target Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; 20 proteins are already targeted by existing drugs for other diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Mental Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings challenge traditional brain-only views, suggesting whole-body involvement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression, schizophrenia and other mental health conditions affect 1 in 4 people in their lifetime, but mechanisms underlying these conditions are poorly understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research led by researchers at the University of Bristol has linked the body’s immune response with schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109410"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response related proteins in these 7 neuropsychiatric conditions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates mental health conditions might be affected by the whole body as well as changes in the brain. The findings could pave the way for better treatments of some mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with depression or schizophrenia are treated with drugs that work on brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine. However, 1 in 3 people with these conditions do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study led by Dr Christina Dardani and Professor Golam Khandaker in Bristol’s MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) used Mendelian randomisation – a computational approach that uses genetic information from large datasets – to examine whether immunological proteins are likely to be involved in 7 neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team looked at the relationship of 735 immune response related proteins measurable in human blood with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response related proteins in these 7 neuropsychiatric conditions. From the identified biomarkers, 20 showed potential as targets of drugs approved for other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers could potentially be used in the future for novel therapeutics in the area of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a fundamental change in the understanding of causal mechanisms for neuropsychiatric conditions. To date causal explanations for depression and schizophrenia have been predicted on monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, but this study suggests that overactivity of the immune system could also contribute to the cause of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golam Khandaker, Professor of Psychiatry and Immunology and MRC Investigator in the Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences (PHS), said: “Our study demonstrates that inflammation in the brain &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the body might influence the risk of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings challenge the centuries-old Cartesian dichotomy between the body and the mind, and suggests that we should consider depression and schizophrenia as conditions affecting the &lt;em&gt;whole &lt;/em&gt;person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to examine biomarkers identified through genetic analysis using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes research based on health records, animal studies, and  proof-of-concept clinical trials in humans, to further evaluate causality; understand precise mechanisms from inflammation to symptoms of mental health conditions; and therapeutic potential – does modulating immune pathways improve symptoms of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by a Medical Research Council programme grant for immunopsychiatry to Professor Golam Khandaker.

The identified biomarkers suggest a role of both brain specific and systemic immune response in the aetiology of schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the identified biomarkers, 20 are therapeutically tractable, including &lt;em&gt;ACE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TNFRSF17&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SERPING1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;AGER&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CD40&lt;/em&gt;, with drugs currently approved or in advanced clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the largest available selection of plasma immune-response related biomarkers, our study provides insight into possible influential biomarkers for the aetiology of neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genetically prioritised biomarkers now require examination to further evaluate causality, their role in the aetiological mechanisms underlying the conditions, and therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 13:59:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5FSVlNYUFMVC00RXBlLWlvRnJIc1dMQjFpR215c0FUMWtJQjhjdzc2Zk5CX1JuRWtyY0tSYjJjZURXWWxMZFdENUl2VGZxcnI3YjZmNXRtdFhkRFNabUUxV2ppTW83bGlVY0lhWWV1cnE</guid></item><item><title>科学家可能已经找到了Ozempic的天然替代品- ScienceAlert | Scientists May Have Found a Natural Alternative to Ozempic - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWEs5cTY4RHdxekljOTBicW9rd19WRnJkRGxBTDhTTHh3UXY0a1NCakZMa1pnZkFoLThqWGRySTJHTV9pTWduSDNadVJHVnBxZDlEME9BVVowR2dBMHZ3bE0wUnFETWVqZkJNdXNBQzFTNlpUd1RBNjV0SFFzTVRzeGdpUzREQTZTTGxZTE1FcTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1j6Sw8vPE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159966" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank. This, in turn, decreased the release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png" alt="New Study Hints at Natural Alternative to Ozempic Hiding in The Gut" class="wp-image-149407 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-729x415.png 729w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-768x437.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-1536x875.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-600x342.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of GLP-1 agonist pathway and FGF21 pathway. (Ayesh, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/10/2328"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomedicines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies of mice taking GLP-1 agonists, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10006666/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the drugs stimulate FGF21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in humans, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.62"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that those with genetic variants for the FGF21 hormone are about 20 percent more likely to be top-ranking consumers of sweet foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blood analysis of 60 participants with type 2 diabetes and 24 healthy controls, the researchers in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Ffar4 mutations, which reduce FGF21 production, are linked to an increased preference for sugar, "which may be an important contributor to the development of diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the gut microbiome could be a key mediator of that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the research team found that when mice were treated with a metabolite of &lt;i&gt;B. vulgatus,&lt;/i&gt; it boosted GLP-1 secretion, which then also triggered the secretion of FGF21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, this meant more blood sugar control and fewer sugar cravings in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the same will extend to humans remains to be seen, but the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; their study "provides a strategy for diabetes prevention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in January 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Traits such as higher neuroticism, higher agreeableness, and lower conscientiousness were particularly associated with general mental health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that while personality is a strong predictor, it is only one factor among many, including genetics and life experiences. The findings suggest that understanding personality could help create better-targeted mental health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality Predicts Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; About 25% of mental health risk is tied to personality traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism Linked to Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, and higher agreeableness predicted general mental health issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Factors Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Personality is a strong factor but does not solely determine mental health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common mental health conditions are more closely related to people’s personalities than previously thought, a study suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality traits explain about a quarter of the overall risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and phobias, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the findings show personality is one of the most reliable predictors for the onset and persistence of mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Tartu in Estonia analysed data from more than 16,000 members of the Estonian Biobank – a collection of health data from volunteers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They surveyed people’s personality according to the five traits psychologists define as the main dimensions of human personality: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at more nuanced personality traits – such as tendencies to feel embarrassed, needing reassurance and needing help from others – as predictors of general mental health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at both the general risk of experiencing different types of mental health problems and the risk of some specific problems that only some people experience, such as fear, sleeplessness, fatigue, inattention, and hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant described their personality traits and mental health, and each participant was also rated by someone else who knew them well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that personality traits were more strongly related to mental health problems than suggested by previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 25 per cent of the differences in people’s risk of mental health problems could be traced to their personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the general risk, personality traits explained another quarter of the risk for specific mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a higher general mental health risk tended to have higher neuroticism – a tendency to feel negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tended to have higher agreeableness – a positive orientation towards other people – and lower conscientiousness – a tendency to be organised and hardworking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, specific mental health problems varied in their associations with personality traits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some areas of mental health, such as sleep problems, were not particularly strongly correlated with any aspect of personality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Researcher, Professor René Mõttus, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, said: “By combining data from two sources, we were able to overcome common problems in personality assessments, such as response bias and other types of measurement error. This allowed us to estimate the associations much more accurately.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that people’s personalities do not determine their mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Helo Liis Soodla, of the University of Tartu, said: “Many people whose traits might statistically predict poor mental health report great well-being. Conversely, many people who experience mental health problems at some point in their lives do not appear to be at risk based on their personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In any given individual, a number of things can affect mental health, from genetic risk variants to stressful childhood events. Each factor on its own accounts for only a tiny proportion of the risk of poor mental health. And much is simply down to luck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the more we know about the potential of traits to increase mental health risk, the more likely we are to be able to design successful interventions to reduce the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was funded by the Estonian Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and personality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cf6f3fdf2f2f9b2f1f3eeeef5eff3f2dcf9f8b2fdffb2e9f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joanne Morrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ed.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Joanne Morrison – University of Edinburgh&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/abn0000967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Assessing the Overlap of Personality Traits and Internalizing Psychopathology Using Multi-Informant Data: Two Sides of the Same Coin?&lt;/a&gt;” by René Mõttus et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing the Overlap of Personality Traits and Internalizing Psychopathology Using Multi-Informant Data: Two Sides of the Same Coin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality and psychopathology share a hierarchical dimensional structure, developmental trajectories and correlations with varied outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, quantifying the extent and details of their direct empirical overlap has been hindered by overreliance on self-reports and broad construct domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multimethod data, we estimated the Big Five personality domains’ and nuances’ (items’) “true” correlations (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt;) with, and true predictive accuracy (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;truePRED&lt;/sub&gt;) for, various psychopathology state domains, free of single-method and occasion-specific biases, random error, and direct content overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sample included Estonian Biobank participants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 16,226) who completed psychopathology and comprehensive personality questionnaires, and whose personality traits were also rated by close informants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality nuances out-predicted the Big Five domains for psychopathology, with items’ &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;truePRED&lt;/sub&gt; = .31 … .58 for specific psychopathology domains of distress, fear, inattention, hyperactivity, insomnia, and fatigue, and &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;truePRED&lt;/sub&gt; = .52 for the general &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual items had various meaningful &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt;s with the psychopathology domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Big Five, neuroticism was the strongest correlate of distress (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .29) and fear (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .13), while inattention was most correlated with conscientiousness (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = −.56), hyperactivity with extraversion (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .25), fatigue with openness (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .12), and insomnia with conscientiousness (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .12).

While IIT emphasizes deep integration of brain regions and GNWT highlights widespread broadcasting of information, data from 256 human subjects did not fully support either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, results suggested sensory and perceptual processing areas, rather than the prefrontal cortex, may play a more central role in conscious experience. This discovery could advance efforts to detect covert consciousness in unresponsive patients and reshape future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Clear Winner:&lt;/strong&gt; Neither Integrated Information Theory nor Global Neuronal Workspace Theory fully explained consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Areas Highlighted:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest consciousness may be rooted in sensory processing, not prefrontal control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding consciousness pathways may aid detection of covert awareness in brain injury patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Allen Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An experiment seven years in the making has uncovered new insights into the nature of consciousness and challenges two prominent, competing scientific theories: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published today in&lt;em&gt; Nature&lt;/em&gt; and mark a pivotal moment in the goal to understand the elusive origins consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IIT suggests that consciousness emerges when information inside a system (like the brain) is highly connected and unified, for as long as the information is consciously perceived, acting as a single whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, GNWT suggests a network of brain areas will spotlight important pieces of information in the brain—bringing it to the forefront of our minds—broadcasting it widely the moment it enters consciousness, and this produces conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two competing theories were tested against one another in 2019 in a collaborative experiment involving 256 human subjects, and the findings were just released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute’s mission of team science, open science and big science, in service of one of the biggest, and most long-standing, intellectual challenges of humanity: the Mind-Body Problem,” said Christof Koch, Ph.D., meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unravelling this mystery is the passion of my entire life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Findings &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research showed that there’s functional connection between neurons in early visual areas of the brain (the areas that process vision, which are at the back of the brain) and the frontal areas of the brain, helping us understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings de-emphasize the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it’s important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, intelligence is about doing while consciousness is about being. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This discovery has implications for how we understand consciousness and may shed light on disorders of consciousness such as comas or vegetative states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying where consciousness comes from could help detect “covert consciousness” in unresponsive patients with severe injuries—a condition known to occur in about one-quarter of cases as reported in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neither Theory Came Out on Top  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated Information Theory (IIT) says consciousness comes from the interaction and cooperation of various parts of the brain as they work together to integrate information, like teamwork. It arises from how these parts are connected and how they share information with each other rather than any one individual area or part of the brain generating consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, however, did not find enough lasting connections in the back of the brain to support this idea. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) supports the idea that consciousness happens in the front of the brain, but the study didn’t find enough support for this idea either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was clear that no single experiment would decisively refute either theory. The theories are just too different in their assumptions and explanatory goals, and the available experimental methods too coarse, to enable one theory to conclusively win out over another,” said Anil Seth, Ph.D., a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having said all this, the findings of the collaboration remain extremely valuable – much has been learned about both theories and about where and when in the brain information about visual experience can be decoded from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 256 subjects, which is unprecedented for this kind of experiment. Researchers showed them various visual stimuli and then used three common human brain measurement tools that track blood flow as well as magnetic and electrical activity to study their brains while they looked at the stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly collaborative experiment is the result of a large-scale, open science collaboration that began at a workshop at the Allen Institute in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This innovative approach brought together researchers with differing perspectives to test two theories in a collaborative, yet critical, environment aimed at reducing confirmation bias and accelerating scientific progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adversarial collaborations are a powerful social process, little used because of its challenging nature, within any field that has competing theories,” said Koch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bio-medical field could hugely profit by ‘friendly’ competition among theories—neurobiological or others. But it requires a great deal of cooperation and work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this consciousness and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c000516420819091b0907092c0d0000090205021f18051819180942031e0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Dueweke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Allen Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Dueweke – Allen Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;” by Christof Koch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT) and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) via a theory-neutral consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1OM01ra3VKYktYYTlaamZsaUxKR3VSZnRGNUtHWGFjUjhhM0NuZzc0Z2hFcWwtSWNuZXE3LWlqQ29KZlR3NFpmS0pwNW1ucFFxcklJUGFwZFFOSDNhWWpyUDBWVTdGQnZCeUhSNEwwUmNsdWYyRnpuaA</guid></item><item><title>死是什么感觉？明尼苏达大学的虚拟现实体验提供了一些答案。- Star Tribune | What is it like to die?

&lt;p&gt;Recent research is revealing that the earliest stages of human development, even before birth, may hold the key to predicting &lt;strong&gt;life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Adelaide&lt;/strong&gt; suggests that the length of &lt;strong&gt;telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; at birth could be a significant marker of how long an individual may live — and how susceptible they might be to &lt;strong&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/strong&gt; as they age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of &lt;strong&gt;Telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; are crucial components of &lt;strong&gt;chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt; that play a central role in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-reveal-newly-discovered-protein-could-be-the-secret-to-reversing-aging-%e2%8f%b3/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73951" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt; structures protect the ends of chromosomes, and each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, as telomeres become too short to protect chromosomes, the cell can no longer divide and dies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This process has long been linked to aging, and the length of telomeres at birth could be a critical factor in determining an individual’s &lt;strong&gt;lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/newsroom/news/list/2025/03/17/embryo-development-holds-key-to-healthy-lifestyles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Rebecca Robker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a leading researcher at the University of Adelaide, some babies are born with shorter telomeres than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shorter telomeres are observed in children of women with obesity or metabolic syndrome,” Robker explained. “As adults, these individuals are at increased risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular events, such as a heart attack or stroke, even when they are not obese themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight how the biological clock begins ticking before birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;Maternal Health&lt;/strong&gt; Impacts Telomere Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed a striking connection between the health of the &lt;strong&gt;mother&lt;/strong&gt; and the telomere length in her offspring. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Factors such as maternal &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/soda-daily-why-you-should-think-twice/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76015" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;or metabolic syndrome, which are known to affect a mother’s health, appear to directly impact the telomere length of the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/chicken-embryos-dinosaur-gene-switch/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83638" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;developing embryo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This means that a woman’s health prior to and during &lt;strong&gt;conception&lt;/strong&gt; can have lasting effects on the future health of her child, influencing their risk for &lt;strong&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that maternal health and &lt;strong&gt;environmental conditions&lt;/strong&gt; during the early stages of conception play a critical role in determining telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process is highly responsive to signals from the mother’s body,” said Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Yasmyn Winstanley&lt;/strong&gt;, co-lead author of the study. “Our findings show that maternal health and environmental conditions at the time of conception can have long-term consequences and can even influence the offspring’s susceptibility versus resilience to aging-associated diseases in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanism of &lt;strong&gt;Telomere Resetting&lt;/strong&gt; in Embryos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating findings of the study is how embryos can &lt;strong&gt;reset&lt;/strong&gt; the telomeres they inherit from their parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Shortly after &lt;strong&gt;fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;, the embryo inherits telomeres from both the egg and sperm, which may already be shortened due to the age of the parents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the embryo has a natural mechanism that extends these telomeres, essentially resetting the biological clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reset process can be disrupted by &lt;strong&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/strong&gt;, which can shorten telomeres even further. The researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;mitochondrial health&lt;/strong&gt; plays a significant role in this process, as mitochondria are responsible for producing the energy needed for telomere extension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By studying embryos in mice, the team discovered that when mitochondrial function was impaired, telomeres did not reset properly, leading to shorter telomeres at birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential &lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic&lt;/strong&gt; Approaches to Influence Telomere Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the shortening of telomeres before birth can increase the risk of chronic diseases, the researchers also discovered promising &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using existing &lt;strong&gt;medications&lt;/strong&gt;, like the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-finally-crack-60-year-mystery-behind-diabetes-wonder-drug-metformin/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73996" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antidiabetic drug metformin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it is possible to help reset and lengthen the telomeres in embryos, potentially improving their future health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Robker&lt;/strong&gt; emphasized that “There are therapeutic opportunities to optimize this biology, which is a key determinant of chronic disease risk.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This opens up a potential avenue for interventions that could mitigate the long-term effects of shortened telomeres, offering hope for improving the health of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are continuing their work in collaboration with &lt;strong&gt;Vitaleon Pharma&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on developing treatments that can improve telomere length through pre-conception and early embryo development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings not only offer a new perspective on the origins of aging but could also revolutionize how we approach &lt;strong&gt;reproductive medicine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;public health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;If you ask the personal trainer Hilary Hoffman her top tip for gym-goers, it's simple: Stop working yourself to total exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman came to this realization while she was working a high-pressure job as a financial analyst in the mid-2010s, often having just &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-fit-5-minute-workouts-tips-trainer-wall-st-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;five minutes a day for exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became fixated on designing an exercise regime that was intense without exhausting her or making it hard to keep up with her demanding career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tried-expensive-54d-workout-review-pros-cons-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ideal workout&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the perfect job: tough enough to spark growth and reward big ambitions, but supportive enough to overcome the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got to work hard, but if you're working hard at something that has no upward trajectory, that's not on you in terms of your ability to succeed — it's really on your environment," Hoffman, the founder of the fitness program SotoMethod, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/burn-fat-build-muscle-workouts-diet-personal-trainer-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;make more gains&lt;/a&gt; by working out just hard enough that you feel the burn without burning out, Hoffman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to tell you to push through a challenge, push through a burn," she said. "If you feel pain or if you feel discomfort, those are your signs to stop. But you've got to determine what resistance looks like versus pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to tell if a hard workout is doing more harm than good — and how it should feel when you're doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="59993e5f-36c1-4bfd-ac9d-fe740e65a96a" data-toc-id="59993e5f-36c1-4bfd-ac9d-fe740e65a96a"&gt;Red flags: total exhaustion and inconsistency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common gym mistake is thinking you need to be exhausted to get a good workout, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/if-not-sore-after-workout-was-it-still-good-doms-2020-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fatigue and soreness&lt;/a&gt; don't necessarily mean you'll get results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="59993e5f-36c1-4bfd-ac9d-fe740e65a96a"&gt;Warning signs that you're &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warning-signs-exercising-too-much-2021-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;overtraining&lt;/a&gt; or pushing too hard include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You feel pain or discomfort in your joints or areas that aren't supposed to be working, such as back pain during a core workout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're completely drained after working out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You dread working out, are consistently tempted to skip a scheduled workout, or often consider cutting it short.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working out feels overwhelming; you struggle to maintain your exercise schedule over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective workout strategy is to find exercise you can do consistently over the long term so you can keep making progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If something isn't working, check in to make sure you're keeping good form, consider easing up on the intensity, or shorten the workout, Hoffman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strongest thing you can do when you feel pain is to stop because you're just protecting your body so that you can come back tomorrow and do this again to build more strength," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Carmen Aiken of Chicago made an appointment for an annual physical exam in July 2023, planning to get checked out and have blood work done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment was at a family medicine practice run by University of Illinois Health. Aiken said the doctor recommended they undergo a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Aiken, who works for a nonprofit and uses the pronoun they, was also encouraged to get the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’d tested positive for HPV in 2019 and eventually cleared the virus but hadn’t gotten the vaccine to prevent future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sounds like a good idea,” Aiken, 37, recalled telling the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also needed some lab work — part of routine monitoring for one prescription. After being examined, Aiken said, they were directed to a different part of the office building to get blood drawn and receive the first dose of the vaccine before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the bill for what Aiken thought would be a free yearly exam: $1,430.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The medical procedure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The services at Aiken’s appointment included a pelvic exam, a vaccination and blood work to check, among other things, glucose levels and liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yearly physical typically includes a variety of services, many that insurers are &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-adults/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;required to cover&lt;/a&gt; under the federal Affordable Care Act, such as reviewing the patient’s health history, screening for high cholesterol and performing a Pap smear to check the cervix for signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updating immunizations is also a common and typically covered service that’s a part of checkups. The vaccine for HPV — the human papillomavirus — provides protection against an infection that can cause several types of cancer. &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Federal health officials recommend&lt;/a&gt; being immunized for HPV at 11 or 12, though the vaccine also can be administered later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The final bill&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was $1,430.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That broke down to $1,223.22 for lab services and pathology, plus $206.91 for “professional services,” which included a charge for a 40-minute “High Mdm” outpatient visit — indicating a high level of “medical decision-making” — as well as charges for immunization administration and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A hospital price tag for blood work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billing issue for Aiken is that not all services that might be provided as part of a yearly physical necessarily will be covered by insurers as preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who needs blood work for a specific medical concern — as Aiken did, for medication monitoring — could be required to pay part of the bill. That’s true even if the blood work is performed during a checkup alongside preventive services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health insurers pay for standard blood work as part of a preventive visit. But that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiken had purchased a health insurance plan on the federal marketplace and thought the visit would be covered at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bill came for more than $1,400, Aiken thought, “How did this happen?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said they called their insurer, BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois, and then, after an initial inquiry went nowhere, filed an appeal for the $1,223.22 amount owed for lab services, thinking: “Surely, this is a misunderstanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the insurer sided with UI Health’s position that the blood work wasn’t preventive. In a letter denying Aiken’s appeal, BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois said that “the labs were billed correctly as diagnostic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer decided that Aiken was on the hook for 50% of the cost of outpatient labs performed in a hospital setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Van de Walle, a spokesperson for BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois, wouldn’t discuss Aiken’s bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Sacco, a UI Health spokesperson, said Aiken scheduled the appointment for “medication monitoring and to obtain a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Medication monitoring is not considered a wellness benefit under the Affordable Care Act,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacco also said Aiken’s labs were sent for processing to University of Illinois Hospital, more than a mile from the family medicine practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That left Aiken owing more. Hospitals typically charge much more than doctors’ offices or independent commercial labs for the same tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between a preventive visit and a diagnostic one is important for billing purposes: It dictates who’s on the hook for the bill. A preventive visit generally comes at no cost to patients. But a visit for an ongoing medical issue is usually classified as diagnostic, leaving the patient subject to copays and deductibles — or even charged for two separate appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients might not notice a difference in the exam room. Much of that nuance is determined by the medical provider and captured on the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still confusion about such billing matters 15 years after the ACA’s preventive services protections took effect, according to Sabrina Corlette, a founder and co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an outrageous bill for what should have been routine care,” Corlette said. “People just don’t have this kind of money lying around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The resolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the insurer denied the billing appeal, Aiken “fell down a hole into despair about it for a while. And then someone really wise was, like, ‘You can pay it, and then just stop thinking about it.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s what Aiken did: “I put it on my credit card.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacco said UI Health works with insurers to resolve cost-sharing disputes, “however, it is the insurance company’s sole discretion whether a service is fully covered or subject to cost-sharing. In this case, the insurer determined that cost-sharing would be applicable to a specific portion of the services provided to the patient. Based on this determination, the patient was billed accordingly by UI Health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience had a lasting impact on Aiken, who said that last year they walked out of an urgent-care visit after a doctor recommended a Pap smear — fearing that would result in another big bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying or avoiding care can lead to worse outcomes, which is why lawmakers tried to ensure that patients generally would pay nothing for preventive services like immunizations under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearly checkups are a key element of preventive care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, most adults who never got the HPV vaccine don’t know they’re still eligible, so it’s critical to inform them of their options, said Dr. Verda Hicks, a gynecologic oncologist in Kansas City, Missouri. The vaccine offers protection against nine types of HPV and against HPV-related cancers in men, so the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that boys get the shot, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Get vaccinated,” Hicks said, pointing out the difference it makes for HPV. “We just do not have the same tools for many other cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some insurance companies won’t cover the cost of the vaccine &lt;a class="Link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21613-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;for some older patients&lt;/a&gt; — and the same services might be subject to different cost-sharing rules depending on whether they are conducted for prevention versus diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, prices can vary depending on where you go for care and where the tests are performed. If you need a blood test, ask that your doctor send the requisition to a commercial, in-network lab. People might not realize that labs drawn at a clinic could be sent to a hospital for testing, opening them to higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a push in Congress to eliminate this price variation through “site-neutral” payment policies under which, regardless of location, the price for routine care would be reimbursed at the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Site-neutral reforms could potentially have significantly reduced Carmen’s expenses,” said Christine Monahan, an assistant research professor at Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially upending the current systemm a case before the Supreme Court could eliminate the requirement that insurers cover preventive services like vaccines and annual screenings at no cost to patients. If the justices — who &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-316.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;heard oral arguments on that on April 21&lt;/a&gt; — side with the plaintiffs, Corlette said, “Then, we all potentially lose access to free, high-value preventive care. And that would be a real shame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/samantha-liss-kff-health-news" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Samantha Liss &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/lauren-sausser-kff-health-news" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lauren Sausser&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; are reporters for KFF Health News.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He has won more than a dozen national journalism awards and is a four-time Pulitzer finalist.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was the culmination of my career, the pinnacle of my research” over the last 38 years, DeCarli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/alzheimers-research/news/news-grant-for-dementia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$53-million study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, paid in annual allotments, was approved during President Trump’s first term. But in Term Two, the administration has taken a chain saw to universities, federal jobs and federal funding for scientific research, which has prompted talk of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00938-y" target="_blank"&gt;brain drain,&lt;/a&gt; with scientists looking for work in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The termination letter from NIH informed DeCarli that his study, with its “artificial and non-scientific categories,” was on the chopping block because it “no longer effectuates agency priorities.” The UC Davis study was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/alzheimers-research-nih-funding" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of 14 such research projects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notified in March that funding was being terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 7 million U.S. residents aged 65 and older have Alzheimer’s, the nation’s seventh-leading cause of death. Given the cresting age wave, the number is expected to roughly double in the next 35 years. So it doesn’t make sense that a deeper understanding of a complex set of unremittingly cruel brain diseases that decimate the lives of victims, and their loved ones, is no longer a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3f20ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2712282/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f60bf7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bd7a58/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee40ec6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Mannie Rezende, suffering from Alzheimer's, walks with Rose Shalom at home in 2023." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09cd7e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed6c2d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43646c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07103e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07fba4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07fba4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Mannie Rezende, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s, walks with his wife Rose Shalom in June 2023.

But in this case, “diverse” was a reference to a spectrum of health and age, and educational and racial backgrounds of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of UC Davis lawyers, DeCarli appealed the decision, but he also had to begin shutting down the study in anticipation of a second rejection or a long appeal process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeal was successful, and funding was restored on April 11, but DeCarli is still playing catch-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were big-time disruptions,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical partners, who each had to contact as many as 100 patients with news of the termination, had to reach out again to tell them the green light was back on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for how long?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody seems to know, said Russ Paulsen of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.usagainstalzheimers.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UsAgainstAlzheimer’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit advocacy group.

And the official word at Health and Human Services is that the administration remains committed to “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/30/congress/collins-says-trumps-research-cuts-must-be-reversed-00318301" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;robust biomedical research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” and “maintaining our global leadership in science and technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that claim doesn’t square with the dismissal earlier this year of 1,000 NIH employees, or with news accounts of a plan to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/trump-administration-mulls-sharp-funding-cuts-at-health-agencies-00294781" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;slash 30% of the Health and Human Services budget&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 40% of the NIH budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to imagine somebody opposed to finding cures, and yet we have no explanation for why they’re proposing a 40% cut,” Paulsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that funds are flowing out the door far slower than they have in many years, and we know that researchers are submitting high-quality research and getting ‘answer pending’ or getting rejected,” he added. “And we know that existing multi-year grants are being canceled or payment is being delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Rose Shalom of Sunland lost her husband, Mannie Rezende, who had slowly deteriorated from Alzheimer’s over several years. Shalom called the disruption of research egregious and immoral, and she said those who control the purse strings on research should “spend some time with someone with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers to understand the unique horror of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-17/mannie-and-rose-one-couples-journey-through-alzheimers-a-very-tricky-thief"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rose and Mannie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 at their home and at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.opica.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OPICA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the West L.A. adult day-care center where Mannie spent his days with a few dozen others on the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we are living longer, more and more people will be diagnosed with this disease,” Shalom said. “The emotional and financial toll on the patients and their caregivers is beyond description.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, no cure on the immediate horizon. But DeCarli said there have been some encouraging advances, including medication that can help slow the progression of cognitive decline, and improved diagnostics that can lead to earlier intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is both a world leader and a collaborator in medical research, DeCarli said. The process is integrated, “with people working on different parts … of the same question, and true discovery sometimes comes from interacting” with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration seems to have a different agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Dismantling the U.S. role in solving medical mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/climate/national-climate-assessment-authors-dismissed.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;· Dismissing hundreds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of researchers studying the impact of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/scientists-fleeing-america-trump-cuts-funding-jobs-1235324006/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;· Driving scientists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to look for work in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew there’d be so many backwater swamps, potholes and detours on the road to making America great again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;steve.lopez@latimes.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxQSExFaHRWN3FTdlVZQ0FPVkZTd1dFQ3I4X09sMEQ3c2tGN2JGYWwxMFdyMmllRXVlMDRrNlYzYnFMeVBOTWJjeng4bTBqOGNWZS1qZW1oZ3ZQdV92eWRycmRzcmRYNU9Tb3hfSDJWOFZlTWhuQWVqVTA0RUZLaE90ek9DRDBBQXVIOHE4cWRxc2Y4dlFQQXJKTERVZll6OW95VVhudDBCaEpoUUJCS1hSTUIyWDBRY1JTWWdSOUFUWVlJamtUeG1iaGx6MA</guid></item><item><title>通过吃大多数人每天吃的1种食物可以增加痴呆症的风险- Surrey Live | Dementia risk can be increased by eating 1 type of food most people eat every day - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOeU1mN0t6RXVfYTRKQW16Y0FVRHhHLUwzQkp4QVA3WEdfaXVTdUtWQjFnemRvbXh6LWp6OXFyeW84ZjY4LTlmalB3Z1FpTFlMUnRLSjh5R2k3QzBHUjVWYm80ZUU3X0FuRUgzR1BaQ3A1d01Sd0VMbW12RjBBLWhHd3JXNkcxQTZoTV9j?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, growing research has raised concerns about the impact of ultra-processed foods on brain health - particularly their potential link to dementia. These highly engineered products, often packed with added sugars, artificial ingredients, and unhealthy fats, are designed for convenience and long shelf life but may come at a cost to cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have begun to show that diets high in ultra-processed foods are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, memory loss, and even dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/diet-high-in-ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-dementia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, previously shared how processed foods can also be linked to dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said: "We don’t know for sure why people who eat ultra-processed foods show an increased risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The researchers suggest it could be because these diets involve lower levels of important nutrients like fibre, because they include too much sugar and sodium, or because they may lead to high blood pressure or inflammation, which can be bad for long-term brain health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31556821" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2022 Chinese study on the effects of UPFs showed that out of 72,083 people, 518 went on to develop a form of dementia, with 287 being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and 119 with vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, it showed that those who consumed ultra-processed foods did have an increased risk of developing dementia, compared to those who did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This same research suggested that if people were to replace their intake of ultra-processed foods with minimally processed food by as little as 10%, they could potentially reduce their risks of developing dementia by 19%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rosa Sancho further explained: “We know that what is good for our heart health is also good for our brain health, so we encourage people to stay active, socially connected and involved in activities and hobbies that they enjoy. It is also important to maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has also revealed links between ultra-processed food and high risks of depression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by Dr Raaj Mehta of Harvard Medical School, alongside Massachusetts General Hospital, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; focused on over 31,000 American women and the impact of eating a poor diet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team tracked middle-aged women who had no sign of depression from 2003 to 2017, assessing their diets every four years, and the results were shocking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study, a diet rich in ultra-processed foods - such as bacon, sausages, and artificially sweetened drinks - has a high chance of increasing your chances of suffering from depression. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These foods typically contain five or more ingredients, often including additives and preservatives that aren't normally used when cooking at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the study it was revealed that the women who indulged in a higher proportion of UPF had larger BMIs and were also more likely to smoke and far less likely to exercise regularly. Not only this, but they had an increased prevalence of diabetes and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also found that those women who decreased their intake of the 'bad foods' by at least three daily servings had a decreased likelihood of developing depression, in comparison to those who continued to eat a UPF-rich diet, over the course of the four-year intervals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly what element of ultra-processed foods is linked to depression, but their findings suggest that artificial sweeteners may be what is affecting the brain’s chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 09:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOeU1mN0t6RXVfYTRKQW16Y0FVRHhHLUwzQkp4QVA3WEdfaXVTdUtWQjFnemRvbXh6LWp6OXFyeW84ZjY4LTlmalB3Z1FpTFlMUnRLSjh5R2k3QzBHUjVWYm80ZUU3X0FuRUgzR1BaQ3A1d01Sd0VMbW12RjBBLWhHd3JXNkcxQTZoTV9j</guid></item><item><title>参观儿童博物馆后，帕萨迪纳居民百日咳检测呈阳性-洛杉矶时报 | Pasadena resident tests positive for whooping cough after visiting children’s museum - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQOE5VbjctaklLUkwzQ3BzWnBmT0JmLUpBR3lKZGQ0RTRpdWsyenZPQUJhZWQzMlhpeTZtQlNKQWNPNjRzSXZIS1FwNkl0VlJJeS1xUDk3TVpRNmswNTBqLW0xbG1vbXRsdTVfMTQxZ05WZXVKeFBGNVNBOGxlMGpNV0RmbjI5VHpEZS1JZ3dJMGwxRXpGVFh2N09XSGJ3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-body font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 text-primary-text-color clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Pasadena resident has tested positive for whooping cough, a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-22/highly-contagious-whooping-cough-rises-in-california-to-highest-levels-in-years"&gt;highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; that can be lethal in infants, after visiting the Kidspace Children’s Museum last week, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pasadena Public Health Department announced the infection on Thursday as whooping cough cases &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;continue to rise&lt;/a&gt; across the United States. There have been more than 8,470 cases reported nationally  in 2025, which is about double the cases reported in the same time period last year, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/177663" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials warned anyone who visited Kidspace from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on April 25 to monitor their household, and especially children, for symptoms such as a runny nose, a low-grade fever and difficulty breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone feeling ill after visiting the museum during this window is urged to visit their healthcare provider and avoid contact with babies and pregnant women. Infections can be confirmed with a nasal swab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk individuals, such as infants younger than 1 and pregnant women, may need preventive antibiotics even if they are not showing symptoms, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, which attack the upper respiratory system and can cause airways to swell, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin five days to three weeks after exposure with a mild cold and a fever of less than 100.4 degrees. In severe cases, symptoms will progress to coughing fits that cause gasping or whooping sounds and vomiting. Infants may not display the telltale whooping cough, but turn blue, red or gag due to difficulty breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California whooping cough cases more than quadrupled last year — from 644 in 2023 to 2,753 in 2024, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/Pertussis_Report_DEC2024.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt;. In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana and a 5-year-old in Washington have died from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are vaccines for whooping cough. As early as 2 months old, babies get the first in a series of DTaP shots, which also protects against diphtheria and tetanus. The vaccine is administered again at 4 months, 6 months and then again at 15 to 18 months and when the child is between 4 and 6 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine series is part of school-entry immunization requirements in all 50 states, and a booster shot is recommended for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts attribute the uptick in infections to decreasing vaccination rates. Last year, the share of children with exemptions to school-entry vaccinations across the country hit an all-time high of 3.3%, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s unfortunately been increasing anti-vaccine sentiment in the United States,” Dr. Ericka Hayes, who works at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Associated Press. “Our recovery is not nearly as quick as we expected it to be and we needed it to be. And again, when you fall below 95% for vaccinations, you lose that herd immunity protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

The modified procedure only needs an incision of 2-3cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The Royal Free Hospital is now one of the few centres in the world which can offer this type of surgery," said Mr Nikkhah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's more difficult to perform but improves recovery.

even bullying or perceptions of unfair treatment and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a presentation of the report's findings, staff were told that "some of the behaviours

class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is the key component of weight loss and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-benefits-and-risks-revealed-in-new-study"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, and an international team of researchers has now discovered it can also do wonders for people who have developed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-estimates-millions-in-us-risk-liver-damage-from-herbal-remedies"&gt;liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research"&gt;phase 3 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 800 participants and lasting 72 weeks, a weekly dose of semaglutide was effective in almost two-thirds of patients at treating a serious form of fatty liver disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_dysfunction%E2%80%93associated_steatotic_liver_disease"&gt;Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt; (MASH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results from this landmark study across 37 countries provide strong evidence that semaglutide can help patients with MASH by not only improving liver health, but also addressing the underlying metabolic issues that contribute to the disease," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arun Sanyal, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159960" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart.jpg" alt="Liver treatment chart" class="wp-image-159960 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart-600x276.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159960" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The treatment had benefits for reducing inflammation and scarring. (Sanyal et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were split into two groups. Of those given the semaglutide treatment, 62.9 percent saw improvements in their MASH, compared to 34.3 percent of the group given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; treatment instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, liver fibrosis (scarring) – which happens as the liver tries to repair damage – was reduced in 36.8 percent of patients given the semaglutide treatment, compared to 22.4 percent of patients given placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvements in both MASH and fibrosis were seen in 32.7 percent of the participants on semaglutide, compared to 16.1 percent of the placebo group. It's a comprehensive win for the drug, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drug-semaglutide-shows-promise-as-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;showing potential&lt;/a&gt; in many different areas of health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That placebo effect is fairly typical, by the way, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/incredible-placebo-study-shows-fake-pills-can-reduce-stress"&gt;often happens in trials&lt;/a&gt;: it's thought to be a combination of the psychological boost of thinking you're being treated, plus a tendency to live more healthily and carefully if you know you're part of a study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If approved, this could offer an additional therapeutic option for patients with MASH and fibrosis," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanyal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is crucial, given the strong link between MASH and cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal conditions, where semaglutide has already shown established health benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a GLP-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;) receptor agonist, essentially acting like the natural GLP-1 hormone to help regulate key metabolic processes – including reducing appetite and lowering blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes it effective for treating obesity and diabetes, but this boost in biological regulation seems to have plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-just-weight-loss-8-conditions-drugs-like-wegovy-might-treat"&gt;other benefits too&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to liver disease, the thinking is that the metabolism and anti-inflammatory improvements triggered by the drug help to treat some of the key drivers of MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; is continuing, expanding to a larger group of people for a full five years to see if these initial improvements continue. With only one approved treatment available for MASH, new options are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2413258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the United States’ top public health official, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/rfk-mmr-vaccines-fetus-claim"&gt;recently claimed&lt;/a&gt; some religious groups avoid the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine because it contains “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4i7kGh63jo"&gt;aborted fetus debris&lt;/a&gt;” and “DNA particles”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1917748575267602924"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is facing its worst measles outbreaks in years with &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/robert-f-kennedy-jr-revives-measles-vaccine-claims/105242968"&gt;nearly 900 cases&lt;/a&gt; across the country and active outbreaks in several states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Kennedy, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, continues to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/wtf-rfk-jr-even-talking-133618630.html"&gt;erode trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we make of his latest claims?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;There’s no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said “aborted fetus debris” in MMR vaccines is the reason many religious people refuse vaccination. He referred specifically to the Mennonites in Texas, a deeply religious community, who have been &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/robert-f-kennedy-jr-revives-measles-vaccine-claims/105242968"&gt;among the hardest hit&lt;/a&gt; by the current measles outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many vaccines work by using a small amount of an attenuated (weakened) form of a virus, or in the case of the MMR vaccine, attenuated forms of the viruses that cause measles, mumps and rubella. This gives the immune system a safe opportunity to learn how to recognise and respond to these viruses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, if a person is later exposed to the actual infection, their immune system can react swiftly and effectively, preventing serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s claim about fetal debris specifically refers to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine. The rubella virus is generally grown in a human cell line &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/how-are-vaccines-made/human-cell-strains-vaccine-development"&gt;known as WI-38&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally derived from lung tissue of a single elective abortion in the 1960s. This cell line has been used for decades, and no new fetal tissue has been used since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues"&gt;vaccines for other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, such as chickenpox, hepatitis A and rabies, have also been made by growing the viruses in fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cells are used not because of their origin, but because they provide a stable, safe and reliable environment for growing the attenuated virus. They serve only as a growth medium for the virus and they are not part of the final product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think of the cells as virus-producing factories. Once the virus is grown, it’s extracted and purified as part of a rigorous process to meet strict safety and quality standards. What remains in the final vaccine is the virus itself and stabilising agents, but not human cells, nor fetal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So claims about “fetal debris” in the vaccine are false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting the world’s major religions &lt;a href="https://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2022-12/Vaccine%20componenets%20fact%20sheet%20December%202022.pdf"&gt;permit the use of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; developed from cells originally derived from fetal tissue when there are no alternative products available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The US is currently grappling with measles outbreaks.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Annie Rice/EPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are there fragments of DNA in the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy claimed the Mennonites’ reluctance to vaccinate stems from “religious objections” to what he described as “a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles” in the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter claim, about the vaccine containing DNA particles, is technically true. Trace amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-dna-fetal-cells-vaccines.pdf"&gt;DNA fragments&lt;/a&gt; from the human cell lines used to produce the rubella component of the MMR vaccine may remain even after purification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with this claim, there’s an implication these fragments pose a health risk. This is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any DNA that may be present in this vaccine exists in extremely small amounts, is highly fragmented and degraded, and is biologically inert – that is, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-dna-fetal-cells-vaccines.pdf"&gt;it cannot cause harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if, hypothetically, intact DNA were present in the vaccine (which it’s not), it would not have the capacity to cause harm. One common (but unfounded) concern is that foreign DNA could integrate with a person’s own DNA, and alter their genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing DNA into human cells in a way that leads to integration is very difficult. Even when scientists are deliberately trying to do this, for example, &lt;a href="https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/genetherapy/challenges/"&gt;in gene therapy&lt;/a&gt;, it requires precise tools, special viral delivery systems and controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember our bodies are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4348004/"&gt;exposed to foreign DNA&lt;/a&gt; constantly, through food, bacteria and even our own microbiome. Our immune system routinely digests and disposes of this material without incorporating it into our genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1906629553373458844"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has been extensively studied over decades. Multiple health authorities, including Australia’s &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/addressing-misinformation-about-excessive-dna-mrna-vaccines"&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt;, have addressed the misinformation regarding perceived harm from residual DNA in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the idea that fragmented DNA in a vaccine could cause genetic harm is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what Kennedy would have you believe, there’s no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine, and the trace amounts of DNA fragments that may remain pose no health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the evidence does show, however, is that vaccines like the MMR vaccine offer excellent protection against deadly and preventable diseases, and have saved &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/154-million-lives-saved-in-50-years-5-charts-on-the-global-success-of-vaccines-229707"&gt;millions of lives&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma64wev2000m27p9fnd66eqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, is asking the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an agencywide “scientific process” on treating measles and other conditions with medications as well as alternative therapies such as vitamins, HHS said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pat00083b6mxu23pykm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS statement notes that “the CDC continues to recommend measles vaccination as the most effective way to prevent the disease,” and Kennedy himself &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas"&gt;has publicly encouraged&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination – while saying it’s a “personal” choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau00093b6mbpzod70s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, “we recognize that some individuals and communities across the U.S. may choose not to vaccinate,” the HHS statement says. “Our commitment is to support all families – regardless of their vaccination status – in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000a3b6mlww0rdlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,” the statement says. “This effort will involve collaboration with universities nationwide to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000b3b6muf0xl23q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a measles outbreak centered in West Texas continues to grow, reaching nearly 800 cases as of this week, disease experts fear that Kennedy’s continuing emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html"&gt;unconventional therapies&lt;/a&gt; such as cod liver oil, the antibiotic clarithromycin and the steroid budesonide might take away from efforts to boost vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000c3b6mp7g2nilh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve got doctors now in these communities that are teaching other doctors how to treat this disease with aerosolized steroids, with budesonide, with clarithromycin and others,” Kennedy said Monday at a town hall event hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000d3b6m0eec841a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after the recommended two doses, but there is no specific treatment for measles once someone is infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000e3b6mphmmg2jl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;also recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000f3b6mnxg23eqo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/media/pdfs/2025/05/HCP_Caring-for-Patients-with-Measles_Fact-Sheet_FINAL_3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;measles treatment overview&lt;/a&gt; posted Thursday, the CDC says that “vitamin A may be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider” and that “other therapies, such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000g3b6mpc8m6pyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overview also notes that although there’s no evidence to support routine use of antibiotics in someone with measles, they may be necessary if the person develops a secondary bacterial infection. Likewise, it says that patients with a history of certain airway conditions may be given inhaled steroids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000h3b6mbci3q0cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/measles-misinformation-kff/index.html"&gt;A poll&lt;/a&gt; released last week showed that a growing share of adults in the US have heard false claims about measles and the vaccine, including that vitamin A can prevent infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000i3b6mf0szhpox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really important not to conflate what … [is] supportive or adjunctive care for measles versus curative treatment for measles,” Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland, told CNN in March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000j3b6mgnv7hwoy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/" target="_blank"&gt;a fact-check&lt;/a&gt; on its website, the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes that “Recent claims that budesonide and clarithromycin cure measles are reckless and put children at serious risk. There is no cure for measles. Immunization is the only way to prevent the spread of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Her doctor, Ghassan Abou-Alta, has confirmed her diagnosis - despite a cabal of anonymous Reddit users who claimed they found proof Towle was faking it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He described how Towle's cancer started in the bile ducts in the liver, and after an initial surgery to remove the original tumor, the cancer recurred in her liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tumors were also detected in lymph nodes next to her liver, Abou-Alta said from his office at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor then went on to commend Towle for shining a light on &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14074109/young-fit-women-cancer-killer-disease.html"&gt;young people who are fighting cancer, &lt;/a&gt;more and more of whom are diagnosed every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of them can maintain a fairly normal schedule, even when undergoing chemotherapy, Abou-Alta explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We literally have people who come to us for treatment on their lunchtime from the office and then go back to work,' he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients really can live with cancer. Not everybody should be looking as if they were dying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course not everyone will tolerate chemotherapy as well as Towle, but a number are, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A young patient like Sydney, or at any age really, can keep going and look very good,' the doctor said. 'But it does not undermine that she's still living with a very serious matter.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As Towle shared her life undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments for the bile duct cancer, her fanbase grew and she now has more than 770,000 followers on TikTok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the oncologist was then told that skeptics on Reddit thought Towle was lying about her diagnosis, Abou-Alta reportedly hung his head and shook it in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then recounted how he had told Towle that the point of undergoing chemotherapy is to preserve and prolong life - something that she should cherish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Always what I tell her is, "We want to steal from you one day per week" for treatment,' the doctor said. '"That's when you're a sick person. We have to keep the other six days for you."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet those on the so-called 'snark' Reddit page have claimed Towle's often cheerful videos are proof that she does not actually have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They started the page last fall, as Towle moved from her native California to New York City for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its rules included: 'No defending Syd.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Critics claimed she would not be traveling around and posting cheerful videos if she were truly sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the Redditors noted that Towle had planned a three-week trip to Europe ahead of her move - questioning why someone with cancer would take a break from treatment for vacation, only to return to make dramatic videos about her illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The backlash then intensified over the winter, when the anonymous posters argued that she was not undergoing much chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that Towle maintained her long hair, and zoomed in on videos Towle posted to look for signs of a port - a medical device that is implanted in patients to facilitate chemo treatments and ease blood draws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When they didn't find evidence of one, the Redditors concluded Towle must be lying about her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, when she posted a video showing a port implanted not on her upper chest - as is usual - but on the underside of her arm, they remained skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And even when Towle posted a video in which she appeared to be at a chemotherapy appointment in March, she was hit with backlash just days later, for posting another video showing her with her brother, Austin, in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is us before going scuba diving in the ocean - for the first time,' she wrote in the TikTok video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the next scene, Towle and her brother were seen wearing wetsuits, which Towle said 'is us after our first dive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brother-and-sister duo were in Jamaica for a friend's wedding, but on Reddit, critics saw the stark juxtaposition as evidence she was not sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Syd must WANT to be ousted,' one commentator wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't worry, she'll be back with the fake nausea and baby voice in no time,' another  added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the Reddit page had more than 1,000 members who accused Towle of manufacturing emotion on camera to manipulate sympathetic followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The critics pointed out that Towle maintained her long hair, despite undergoing chemo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the biggest detractors was a Redditor with the username Beginning_Field_2421, who was found to be Connie Wright - a privacy officer for Valley Health System in Bergen County, New Jersey who shapes and manages the organization's patient privacy practices, according to her LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have receipts, medical analysis, fact-checking discussions,' she wrote on the page, urging others to 'join the conversation and tell us how you found out and why you may have doubts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also shared posts with headings like, 'Sydney Towle- Were you lying then or now?' and 'How to spot when Sydney Towle is lying: Her biggest tells, which catalogued her 'slow blinks, pauses and squinting.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wright also used some strong language in her posts, once reportedly writing: 'I've never disbelieved or hated this phony b more than today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others were also alarmed when Google said cholangiocarcinoma 'often affects adults in their 70s' and carries a 'usually poor' prognosis in cases in which the cancer advanced, as had Towle's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the detractors did not seem concerned about their hostility, the Times reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If she fabricated any part of her story, it's deeply unethical and she deserves backlash,' Beginning_Fields_2421 wrote as others hit out at Towle for accepting donations from some of her followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being a public figure comes with scrutiny - it's part of the job.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the hostility spread beyond the Internet, as Wright urged people to complain about Towle to the companies whose products she endorsed and suggested that Reddit commentators show up at a cancer research fundraiser that Towle would be attending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Someone else also suggested sending Towle's photo to cancer hospitals, implying they need to be alerted of a potential fraudster, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third Redditor even contacted the Jamaican scuba company where she and her brother had gone diving, asking about the protocol for allowing cancer patients to participate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Towle also noticed a surge in criticism on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My comments have been so inundated with people being like, "You will burn in hell. You are lying,"' she told the Times, adding that she also received death threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The comments left her feeling stuck, because if she quit social media, she feared her followers would believe she had something to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm sorry that they are so angry that living with cancer can look different than they think it should,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a video after the article was published, Towle finally addressed the hatred she received to her TikTok followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I haven't really addressed this because I was quite frankly shocked when I found out this was a thing - and I wasn't sure how else to prove I have cancer because I was posting at chemo every week,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also know that I know what I'm going through, my friends and family know what I'm going through and that is ultimately what matters the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it has taken a significant toll on my mental health... It has been a lot,' she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Towle concluded by saying she hopes the article 'reinforces that you do not know what someone is going through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just because I am traveling, hanging out with my friends and doing normal things doesn't mean that I don't have Stage IV cancer,' she said, before thanking 'everyone who has supported me, because none of the negativity negates how much I appreciate the support of everyone on here.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 01:28:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOal9vMk43UkM0OW9mc1p5Y1BoNjctSi1NTDkwRVJncFI0LV9ZVTBmaTZONHFzSVp2aHhzeXFJN2ZnSkpmeTh0OGVEcGlPTFUtVHNPXzVaWU8ybDFDck9BMmFTcGVJM2RpdFBtWU44akM4V3RzMXlqSXJocGgtc2NmVVQzNFhhMEExekl2eW1DM2M5WEhLNVhDVWdIcU84UFRldjZhcdIBqgFBVV95cUxQdFF1Z1lqb3ROTXpiWFF0Uzk2bXAweWVRQV9qaGdCTkpvMW1FUUlZS0Nvd0NpRU55QmhiOE1DeDI4VWNyampoQWdPVUFXal9FWU5Md3FBVXk4S1lmU2t5LVBsc3dwSHFLUVN4R0ItdjBYS2JydVJrYk5WRW9TV3RlWEQ2azBLSTJBZ3JJUUE3QnpPQzRrODRtemxQQnMyOGNtaXVHRWcwN0NzQQ</guid></item><item><title>美国卫生部长肯尼迪重提麻疹疫苗中“胎儿碎片”的误导性说法--路透社 | US Health secretary Kennedy revives misleading claims of 'fetal debris' in measles shots - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5wFBVV95cUxQUEpIME1PTElNMW5iNndRU3FHbzgzbFppaG9VaVNzbUN5OF9VQjNBUmdiNkg4a3U3Z1QzcDJKU2VRdFNNT3RZZ0FGOGozZVFqUC1zRU1BOXFwUnZ5Nmd1V0l0S3h4Uy1VaklKOGRsMWtLZXo5QUJRQXN0LW9aNl9NVFNIUEI3T2IwTFZFVmNvTGlFZFBIWG8zQmF3Z2NzZDZaNmxRV0NLdm9xRHYtX0IyUGVTSTVraDdCUUQtMTJSZG5MV0twSmNiTHByRGJ3SVR6UURSM29SdzI3anBzamNUOE82dHRyUms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 01:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5wFBVV95cUxQUEpIME1PTElNMW5iNndRU3FHbzgzbFppaG9VaVNzbUN5OF9VQjNBUmdiNkg4a3U3Z1QzcDJKU2VRdFNNT3RZZ0FGOGozZVFqUC1zRU1BOXFwUnZ5Nmd1V0l0S3h4Uy1VaklKOGRsMWtLZXo5QUJRQXN0LW9aNl9NVFNIUEI3T2IwTFZFVmNvTGlFZFBIWG8zQmF3Z2NzZDZaNmxRV0NLdm9xRHYtX0IyUGVTSTVraDdCUUQtMTJSZG5MV0twSmNiTHByRGJ3SVR6UURSM29SdzI3anBzamNUOE82dHRyUms</guid></item><item><title>阿尔茨海默氏症可能与您已有的常见病毒有关- ScienceAlert | Alzheimer's Could Be Linked to a Common Virus You Already Have - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPaUNYZ0ZmZnZNc3B3cmV0Z0lJX0RYUFZWU1NIMlZJR2JzQjlTanhaOFdsbXNHd091OW9SZzllVVFXV0c5ZkNfM1RCSC1XOUlwTUllMDRuMl95VGtydVdQenYyaVFIR1dYeHNVT2ZIUzlTVFEtSW0zWHd2TlhuUGVEdmFUS1kzWC1RNmh0R0ZDemVlbmFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The common cold sore  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is often caught in childhood, usually stays in the body for life – quietly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;dormant&lt;/a&gt; in the nerves. Now and then, things like stress, illness or injury can trigger it, bringing on a cold sore in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this same virus – called herpes simplex virus type 1 – may also play an important role in something far more serious:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years ago, my colleagues and I made a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;surprising discovery&lt;/a&gt;. We found that this cold sore virus can be present in the brains of older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155366" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore.jpg" alt="Cold Sore" class="size-full wp-image-155366" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore-597x415.jpg 597w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore-600x417.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155366" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Herpes simplex virus type 1 hides out in our body from childhood – occasionally erupting as cold sores. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_sore#/media/File:Herpes(PHIL_1573_lores).jpg"&gt;Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first clear sign that a virus could be quietly living in the brain, which was long thought to be completely germ-free – protected by the so-called "blood-brain barrier".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we discovered something even more striking. People who have a certain version of a gene (called APOE-e4) that increases their risk of Alzheimer's, and who have been infected with this virus, have a risk that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;many times greater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, we studied brain cells that we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394007010786?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected with the virus&lt;/a&gt;. They produced the same abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid clumps on neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that the virus stays mainly dormant in the body for years – possibly decades. But later in life, as the immune system gets weaker, it can enter the brain and reactivate there. When it does, it will damage brain cells and trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated flare-ups could gradually cause the kind of damage that leads to Alzheimer's in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later found the virus's DNA &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18973185/"&gt;inside the sticky clumps of these proteins&lt;/a&gt;, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Even more encouragingly, antiviral treatments reduced this damage in the lab, suggesting that drugs might one day help to slow or even prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956964/"&gt;Large population studies&lt;/a&gt; by others found that severe infections, specifically with the cold sore virus, was a strong predictor of Alzheimer's, and that specific antiviral treatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34136638/"&gt;reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research didn't stop there. We &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-220287"&gt;wondered if&lt;/a&gt; other  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that lie dormant in the body might have similar effects – such as the one responsible for chickenpox and shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_83894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83894" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-642x260.jpg" alt="Varicella zoster virus" class="wp-image-83894 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-83894" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transmission electron microscope image of the varicella zoster virus. (Science Photo Library - HEATHER DAVIES/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles vaccine offers another clue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we studied health records from hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, we saw something interesting. People who had shingles had only a slightly higher risk of developing dementia. Yet those who had the shingles vaccine were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625411/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335"&gt;new Stanford University-led study&lt;/a&gt; gave similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supported our long-held proposal that preventing common infections could lower the risk of Alzheimer's. Consistently, studies by others showed that infections were indeed a risk and that some other vaccines were protective against Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430"&gt;then explored&lt;/a&gt; how risk factors for Alzheimer's such as infections and head injuries could trigger the hidden virus in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced 3D model of the brain with a dormant herpes infection, we found that when we introduced other infections or simulated a brain injury, the cold sore virus reactivated and caused damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we used a treatment to reduce inflammation, the virus stayed inactive, and the damage didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that the virus that causes cold sores could be an important contributor to Alzheimer's, especially in people with certain genetic risk factors. It also opens the door to possible new ways of preventing the disease, such as vaccines or antiviral treatments that stop the virus from waking up and harming the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a link between cold sores and memory loss has grown into a much bigger story – one that may help us understand, and eventually reduce, the risk of one of the most feared diseases of our time.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young kollel wife in Yerushalayim, the daughter of a close talmid chacham friend, recently experienced a harrowing medical ordeal that nearly cost her life rachmana litzlan. Her story serves as an urgent warning about a medication commonly used in Eretz Yisroel but banned in the United States and many other countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This young American woman, living in Yerushalayim while her husband learns in kollel, was expecting her second child. After 33 grueling hours of labor at Hadassah Har Hatzofim Hospital, she required an emergency C-section when the fetal heart rate disappeared. Baruch Hashem, the baby was born healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the surgery, the hospital administered Optalgin (Metamizole) for pain management. This seems to be standard practice in Eretz Yisroel hospitals. This routine pain medication would soon prove to be the source of a life-threatening condition for my friend’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately one week after the birth, the new mother began experiencing severe pain. Upon returning to the hospital, doctors noted her white blood cell count was extremely low but dismissed it as a laboratory error. As days passed, her condition deteriorated dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the following Wednesday, her white blood cell count had plummeted to zero. She had no neutrophils – the white blood cells responsible for fighting infection. A normal neutrophil count ranges between 2,500 and 7,000 per microliter of blood. Without these critical cells, she was at extreme risk for infection, a condition known as agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple hospital admissions, injections to stimulate neutrophil production, and treatment with five different antibiotics, her condition remained critical. Eventually, she was transferred to the hematology ward, where, boruch Hashem, specialists identified the likely cause of her condition: an adverse reaction to Optalgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Culprit: Optalgin (Metamizole)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamizole, marketed in Eretz Yisroel as Optalgin by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is a common over-the-counter painkiller in Eretz Yisroel. It was first produced commercially in Germany in 1922 and was once available worldwide. However, after discovering its potential to cause agranulocytosis, approximately 30 countries – including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and most European Union nations – have banned or severely restricted its use.  Thirteen years ago, Israel’s Health Ministry, after a discussion by a panel of experts, decided not to prohibit the use of over-the-counter painkiller Optalgin or to make it a prescription drug, despite 4 serious cases that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA banned Metamizole in 1977 due to its potential to induce agranulocytosis, a potentially fatal condition with a mortality rate of approximately 24 percent of those who get the condition. Despite these international restrictions, the medication remains readily available over the counter in Eretz Yisroel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the hematologist who treated this young woman, foreign citizens who have never previously taken Optalgin may be particularly susceptible to this severe reaction. A European Medicines Agency report from December 2018 also suggests that genetic characteristics of certain populations may influence susceptibility to Optalgin-induced agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of hospitalization, specialized treatment, and extensive medical intervention, the kollel wife’s white blood cell count finally rebounded, boruch Hashem. By the time she returned home, her newborn was six weeks old, and she had been separated from her toddler for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this ordeal, the young family experienced tremendous chessed from their community, with neighbors caring for their toddler and providing support – Mi k’amcha YEretz Yisroel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the importance of being an informed and proactive patient, especially when receiving medical care in a foreign country. It is this author’s belief that the Mitzvah of v’nishmartem me’od is fullfilled when patients: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1] Ask about all medications being administered, whether orally or intravenously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2] Research unfamiliar medications, particularly those unavailable in their home country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3] Request alternative treatments if uncomfortable with prescribed medications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk does appear to be higher with prolonged use and in women, though serious reactions can occur even after limited exposure.  Reactions are rare, but keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;the FDA did ban it,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative pain relievers include acetaminophen (Tylenol/Acamol) and ibuprofen (Advil/Nurofen), though each carries its own risk profile. Ibuprofen has a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding with regular use, though with a much lower fatality rate than Optalgin-induced agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Yidden from America and other countries continue to visit and settle in Eretz Yisroel, awareness of medications like Optalgin becomes increasingly important. What is routine medical practice in one country may carry unforeseen risks for visitors from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this young kollel wife serves as a powerful reminder that patients and parents (or children of older parents) must be vigilant about their medical care always. &lt;/p&gt;

Seshamani said millions in federal grants were rescinded for this year and 2026 and could have been used for a variety of public health services — from vaccination clinics at the local level to work at the state lab and educational campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;MyIR cost about $293,000 a year to maintain. Seshamani declined to say&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;what else has been or might be cut due to the funding cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Visitors to the MyIR site Thursday found a confounding message: “The MyIR connection to Maryland immunization records is unavailable at this time (beginning May 1, 2025).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Health information portals like MyIR, which stands for “my immunization records,” became popular during the coronavirus pandemic by people who needed to show they had gotten their COVID-19 shots. The portal consolidated records from doctors’ offices, drug stores and other vaccination sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;It has been used by thousands of people in Maryland every month since its inception in 2018, including by parents who need to prove their children were properly vaccinated for camp or school. And now, &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/measles-texas-outbreak-maryland-PZBQKDHXGFCUHDP4LGUTC5QEO4/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/measles-texas-outbreak-maryland-PZBQKDHXGFCUHDP4LGUTC5QEO4/"&gt;amid a national measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, it might have been used by families looking to ensure they are on schedule for the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The site has 600,000 users in Maryland, according to a memo sent April 30 to local health departments from the state health department. The notice, a copy of which was obtained by The Baltimore Banner, alerted them that the consumer site would go offline the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Seshamani did not explain why no advance public notice was given, but said decisions are being made on an ongoing basis. Users of the site were directed to get records from their health care provider or complete the Maryland &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/oideor/immun/pages/rrf.aspx" target="_self" rel="" title="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/oideor/immun/pages/rrf.aspx"&gt;ImmuNet Record Request Form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The MyIR site notes that processing times for ImmuNet record requests may take up to 21 business days or longer, depending on request volume. The state has not typically charged consumers for access to immunization records, though doctors’ offices sometimes require a fee to fill out forms required by schools or camps that include vaccine histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The state health department held the contract with MyIR’s operator STCHealth, an Arizona-based software company that operates the site for about a half-dozen states. Access in those other states appears to be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;A spokesman for STCHealth didn’t immediately offer a comment about the canceled contract, but said the number of users appeared accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image__container image--float-right"&gt;&lt;img src="//www.thebaltimorebanner.com/resizer/v2/EMYIN2F3LVFJTCB6Z4UKMMM3IA.jpg?auth=b683cf1ce323b0a5cf223ab58f231fc8e268e04e1aca092d1d7e10ca0404f5b9&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;height=683&amp;amp;smart=true" alt="A screenshot of the MyIR web portal on Thursday, May 1, 2025, shows the site is offline." class="image "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__caption "&gt;A screenshot of the MyIR web portal on Thursday shows the site is offline. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“We will be sending email notices to all registered users and are working with the vendor to update the MyIR website with appropriate information,” the state wrote in its message to local health departments on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“We recognize that the discontinuation of MyIR will cause an increased workload on staff who will now have to provide immunization documentation for the public,” including staff at doctor offices, local health departments and the state health department, the notice said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Funding has been provided to states for years by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommended the states implement such a system by 2009. All states now have one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In addition to cutting COVID-related funding to states, there have been a number of policy changes at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services related to vaccines, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary, has criticized vaccine safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;That concerns Seshamani, who said that she wanted to preserve more front-line public health needs in exchange for ending&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the MyIR service. She added&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that immunization records will still be available through doctors’ offices and the states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“We will continue to evaluate what we need to do to navigate these headwinds,” Seshami said. “The priority is to mitigate any damage and protect access to care for people in Maryland.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Baltimore Banner</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 00:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQSU8yeFVDUGZOSjUxSk91SUxxNEZ6cXZsVEd2Y0JYVjZObHp5UFhzUWNPcjRGVnlha0pQb00yZFVraFpyZldHM0xCVVNGN2xuWFlnbUM0MUxkRHAtOWo4dnZadFJFd2hleVM0RTI3dXY5UEFuYlhJWU9QWERzZ0YxeHRFN2lGVklnRWxHdXFrb1pBMl9fMkswOVRnTmJ1SVY3eUpfbUdIa1A4SGNuU3JsMzZlQXlid2RJTWlQSw</guid></item><item><title>专家说， RFK Jr.的最新疫苗计划威胁着注射的未来- Axios | RFK Jr.'s latest vaccine plan threatens future of shots, experts say - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFA4cThoZWEySUQwRkR3MEpTT25IeFJTODN3YUJYNndBNWltY2tJMjdFYVIydlA1RWFQNktfX1loNGdoUGhmVVRxOW9wV2JRTjZ2b1hOQ214aW5rZm5TYTk4cEgwd1V1cVNLdXJHY3RhdVhLS3RPVXdLcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFA4cThoZWEySUQwRkR3MEpTT25IeFJTODN3YUJYNndBNWltY2tJMjdFYVIydlA1RWFQNktfX1loNGdoUGhmVVRxOW9wV2JRTjZ2b1hOQ214aW5rZm5TYTk4cEgwd1V1cVNLdXJHY3RhdVhLS3RPVXdLcQ</guid></item><item><title>美国国立卫生研究院以国家安全问题为由，暂停资助与外国合作者的新项目- statnews.com | NIH halts funding for new projects with foreign collaborators, citing national security concerns - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNd2dxQkJoTmxkVGNSU3pZeWlVZXFLVk9EUUV1RmY2TXdLQ0g5VGNwVnRHR2l3eXdQam40d2FZNDNpWHUtdnJQb1FSZ2xIZXAtTWY5aXczSExsZFJURkFZbDVWSy1qRFdZYW9IMjRNX3pkNmNPTGJOMEFyY21qVjJfaFpSai1HRF96RkpJNXJEMzVNY2NnV2U0Sm5ucUwtWlZ3cGRnYmRCcGs1MUJ2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="megan-molteni"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;Megan Molteni reports on discoveries from the frontiers of genomic medicine, neuroscience, and reproductive tech.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health announced Thursday it will no longer allow subawards to foreign institutions, as part of a national security-minded overhaul to how the agency manages its $47 billion research funding portfolio. The change is likely to cause immediate disruptions to research projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Subawards” are NIH funds that a grant recipient can give another organization to carry out a specific piece of the project. It’s an increasingly common practice for scientists to issue subawards to collaborators in other countries, especially as biomedical research has become both more interdisciplinary and more global.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-104.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new guidance&lt;/a&gt;, the NIH intends to create a new grant structure that will eliminate subawards, replacing them with linked awards that the agency says will allow it to track funds with more transparency. NIH plans to implement the new system no later than September 30. &lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly, coffee doesn’t just provide a morning pick-me-up! Studies suggest it may also benefit our health in various ways. For instance, research has shown that drinking more coffee is linked to a reduced &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-weight-loss-meal-plan-for-better-blood-sugar-8739376" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of developing type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether it’s caffeinated or decaffeinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is rich in compounds like caffeine and polyphenols that may support better insulin function and fight inflammation. But not all coffee is created equal. Flavored drinks, coffeehouse treats and instant coffee mixes often include added sugar and saturated fat, which might negate some of those health benefits. That’s why we must take the type of coffee and its preparation under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drinking coffee might be connected;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drinking coffee might be connected&lt;/a&gt; to blood sugar levels and other related health markers in Korean adults, researchers looked at factors like fasting glucose, insulin levels, long-term blood sugar (HbA1c) and measures of insulin resistance and insulin production among those who drank different coffee drinks, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-food-psoriasis-study-11725143" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Just Discovered a Surprising Health Risk of Ultra-Processed Foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientists Just Discovered a Surprising Health Risk of Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was The Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted this study using data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) between 2019 and 2021. Out of 22,559 people surveyed during this period, the researchers included 7,453 participants for their main analysis. For a specific analysis comparing coffee types, they excluded additional participants who consumed coffee in ways they could not analyze accurately, leaving them with 6,613 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at coffee consumption by asking people what they ate and drank over a 24-hour period. They then categorized coffee into two types: black coffee versus coffee with sugar and/or cream. The researchers then grouped participants by how much coffee they drank into non-drinkers, up to 1 cup/day, 2 cups/day and 3 or more cups/day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General characteristics of the participants, such as their lifestyle habits and demographics, were assessed, and they compared different characteristics across coffee drinking habits using appropriate statistical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study how coffee affects markers linked to blood sugar control, the researchers used a statistical model that adjusts for several factors like age, gender, diet quality, physical activity and income. These adjustments help ensure the results are not skewed by other variables. Additionally, they examined if factors like sex or age influenced coffee’s effects and conducted separate analyses where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-lower-chronic-inflammation-study-11725947" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did The Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After conducting analyses, the researchers found that drinking 2 cups of coffee each day appeared to be linked with slightly better glucose metabolism compared to no coffee at all. Specifically, this was seen in lower levels of markers like HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) and fasting insulin, which are related to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When breaking it down further, drinking up to 1 cup of black coffee daily was significantly associated with better glucose metabolism. However, coffee with sugar or cream didn’t show any clear benefits for these markers. This suggests that plain black coffee might have some positive effects on how the body processes sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed differences between men and women. For women, drinking two or more cups of coffee daily, especially black coffee, was associated with healthier levels of health markers related to blood sugar regulation, meaning their blood sugar and insulin levels seemed better controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, women who drank two or more cups of coffee had lower odds of issues with insulin resistance and elevated fasting insulin compared to those who didn’t drink coffee at all. The associations were stronger with black coffee, suggesting it might have unique health benefits. However, in men or individuals who added sugar or cream to their coffee, these benefits were not observed. This indicates that the way coffee is consumed and individual differences, like sex, may play an important role in its potential effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drinks-per-week-increase-dementia-risk-11715884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Many Drinks per Week May Raise Your Risk of Brain Damage by 133%, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Many Drinks per Week May Raise Your Risk of Brain Damage by 133%, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also observed a noticeable pattern where higher coffee intake seemed linked to better glucose metabolism in older adults. However, these results should be interpreted carefully, especially given the unique health factors that often apply to older populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study comes with some limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, we cannot determine cause and effect. However, removing participants who had diseases or were on special diets for health conditions helps reduce the chance of reverse causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is important to note that there were trends when assessing the qualities of certain groups of participants. For example, heavy coffee drinkers tended to have a higher BMI, more education, eat more calories daily, exercise less and sleep fewer hours. Many of them were also current smokers. These factors may impact overall health, including blood glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also couldn’t account for different types of coffee, like decaf, or other caffeine sources such as tea or energy drinks, which may impact the results. Finally, coffee habits were measured only once, not allowing for changes in habits that may impact outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-coffee-makers-8415084" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 7 Best Coffee Makers on the Market, Tested and Reviewed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 7 Best Coffee Makers on the Market, Tested and Reviewed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this study, if you are a coffee lover, considering how you take it might make a difference. Love a good caramel latte or extra-sweet frappuccino? Well, here’s some food (or should we say, drink) for thought. Opting for black coffee or dialing back on the sugar and cream might not just save you a few calories; it could actually help regulate your blood sugar levels, particularly for women and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple adjustments like reducing sweeteners or creamers in your cup might not only enhance the health benefits highlighted by the study but also align with broader dietary goals such as maintaining a balanced blood sugar level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these findings remind us of the importance of personalized health choices. Coffee consumption isn't a one-size-fits-all matter—it may have varying effects based on factors like age, gender and individual health profiles. Reflecting on how these variables apply to your own habits could help you make informed decisions about your daily coffee intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By staying mindful of preparation methods and moderating consumption where necessary, coffee can remain an enjoyable part of your routine while potentially contributing to improved metabolic wellness. Unfortunately, this study did not address whether using sugar substitutes impacts the evaluated outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-mistake-everyone-makes-when-brewing-coffee-11702869" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Top 3 Mistakes Everyone Makes When Brewing Coffee at Home, According to Coffee Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Top 3 Mistakes Everyone Makes When Brewing Coffee at Home, According to Coffee Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee remains a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions worldwide, but as this new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights, the way we choose to consume it may impact its health benefits. If you are focused on supporting better glucose metabolism, opting for plain black coffee may be your best bet. Women and older adults in particular may find greater benefits, as suggested by the study, though individual health considerations should always guide dietary decisions. Moderation and mindful consumption are key takeaways, especially when it comes to avoiding additives like sugar and cream that may diminish coffee's positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of tailoring coffee habits to align with personal health goals. While the study provides compelling evidence of potential links between coffee and improved sugar metabolism, it also reminds us that there is no universal solution. Factors such as lifestyle, individual metabolic needs and even cultural habits play a significant role in determining the overall impact of coffee on health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/coffee-grinders-best-coffee-amazon-11710849" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Mistake You’re Making When Brewing Coffee at Home, and How to Fix It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The #1 Mistake You’re Making When Brewing Coffee at Home, and How to Fix It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-health-benefit-of-coffee-study-11726744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:37:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQN0RLb2xrY1BmT3d3RU8yMUhUa0FDS0lKc05iUkotMkI3bGstY3BRUHoxMThTNmw0dk1vNWZ1X3IwNkdDU2JlWk11cEJnS0N4VTNFYWd0U19SZjFPSnI0ODVTQ1dPQllLRkdOZXZNWVgzRm9CMWRnc3REMm1OTWgwX0N3</guid></item><item><title>“我得了癌症，”抖音明星说。然后是仇恨的洪流。-《纽约时报》 | ‘I Have Cancer,’ the TikTok Star Said.

She modeled clothing and posed in bikinis on the beach. She gallivanted around Europe with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a year, she was an influencer in full, with more than 450,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But her content took a sharp turn in August 2023. In a pink bikini top, her face stained with tears, she spoke directly to the camera. “I have cancer,” she said. “I am strong, so I’ll be good.” She flashed a thumbs-up and an awkward smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Her diagnosis, she said, was cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile ducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Towle’s social media posts grew more frequent and personal, as she joined the ranks of influencers in what is known as CancerTok. She made videos of herself exploring New York City, where she said she had moved to be close to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; struggling with exhaustion and nausea she attributed to chemotherapy; and crying in grief for the carefree life she no longer led.

But a report in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40293177/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (April 27, 2025)&lt;/a&gt; has us excited. That’s because the authors have done some elegant research and have demonstrated surprisingly positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A journalist we respect, Gina Kolata of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; is also careful when writing about a potential cancer breakthrough. She quoted one of the giants in cancer research, Dr. Bert Vogelstein (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/health/cancer-immunotherapy-solid-tumors.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, April 27, 2025&lt;/a&gt;). He is a cancer specialist at John Hopkins University School of Medicine. He told Gina that the results of this research were “groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Gina goes on to describe the outcome of the new clinical trial:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The result was stunning, and could bring hope to the limited cohort of patients contending with these cancers” [solid tumors of the rectum, esophagus, stomach, urinary tract, endometrium and prostate gland with&lt;strong&gt; mismatch repair mutations&lt;/strong&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changing a Cancer Treatment Paradigm:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancers that were treated with the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab (&lt;strong&gt;Jemperli&lt;/strong&gt;) included esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder and prostate. These cancer patients had what are called tumors with mismatch repair mutations in their genes (&lt;strong&gt;dMMR&lt;/strong&gt;). That can make these cancers more susceptible to immunotherapy. And that is exactly what the investigators discovered. I will describe mismatch repair mutations in more depth momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, why is this research a game changer, a potential cancer breakthrough? Solid tumors such as those mentioned above are almost always treated &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; with surgery. For decades, the mantra for cancer treatment has been to &lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; remove the cancer with surgery hoping that you can “get it all.” That is often followed by &lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; chemotherapy and possibly even &lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after all that, far too many people still die from metastases linked to the original solid tumor. For those that respond positively to such treatments, quality of life can be profoundly impacted. That’s not to say that standard treatment doesn’t save many lives. It does. But it’s not as good as we would like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the new research so unique were the results of immunotherapy &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt;. The investigators from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City just used the drug dostarlimab (&lt;strong&gt;Jemperli&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; surgery. One of the authors, Luis Diaz Jr., MD, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist heads the Division of Solid Tumor Oncology at MSK. He specializes in colon and pancreatic cancers. Dr. Diaz has described the results of this research as a “&lt;strong&gt;complete paradigm shift&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Could Dostarlimab (&lt;strong&gt;Jemperli&lt;/strong&gt;) Be a Cancer Breakthrough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the 49 patients who had rectal cancers. These can be very challenging tumors. They frequently get the full spectrum of treatment: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, the overall 5-year survival rate for rectal cancer is 67%. If the cancer is localized, though, the 5-year survival can be as high as 90%. In “regional” tumors, the survival rate is listed as 74%. If the cancer has spread, however, the 5-year rate drops to 18%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients recruited for this study had a “newly diagnosed Stage I, II, or III solid tumor…” They would normally have been initially referred to a surgeon for resection of the cancerous tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer Breakthrough for Rectal Cancers with dMMR:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 49 patients in the MSK (Memorial Sloan Kettering) trial (“cohort 1”) who had diagnosed rectal cancer. These were people with a very specific kind of solid cancer, referred to as “mismatch repair-deficient (&lt;strong&gt;dMMR&lt;/strong&gt;) tumors”. They are highly sensitive to immunotherapy (called immune checkpoint PD-1 blockade). Their tumors were labeled “locally advanced rectal cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were dramatic. Of the 49 patients with rectal cancers, the tumors became undetectable within 6 months. More impressive, there were no recurrences within the five years of the trial. That, dear reader, is impressive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Was There a Cancer Breakthrough for the Other Cancers?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to beat the results of the rectal cancer part of this clinical trial. But remember, there were other patients with solid tumors in this study. Their tumors affected the esophagus, stomach, colon, bladder, prostate and endometrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among the 103 patients who completed treatment across both cohorts, 84 had a clinical complete response, and 82 did not undergo surgery. Among the 117 total patients, recurrence-free survival at 2 years was 92%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bottom Line on the Research:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the treatment results of the immunotherapeutic agent dostarlimab. It is a PD-1 blocker. Patients with Stage I, Stage II or Stage III solid tumors were treated. The investigators reported that the drug was equally effective for most of the cancers treated, though the few patients who did not have a complete response had either prostate or gastroesophageal tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 117 patients included in the analysis and 103 patients who completed the full course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The authors report:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is notable that disease recurrence developed in only five patients. In four of these patients, the recurrence was restricted to the lymph nodes; one patient underwent resection of an isolated lymph node and remained free of disease. The four other patients resumed PD-1 blockade, with three having complete disease regression…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such results are impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bad News About This Potential Cancer Breakthrough:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only patients who participated in this clinical trial were “mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR).” That means the tumors had genetic mutations which make it hard for the cells to repair DNA damage. This kind of solid tumor is relatively rare, occurring in about &lt;strong&gt;2% to 3%&lt;/strong&gt; of cancer patients. The rest of the patients with solid tumors are not expected to fare very well, if at all, by getting Jemperli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means, though, that anyone diagnosed with a solid tumor, such as gastrointestinal, esophageal, uterine, prostate, bladder, etc. should have the tumor &lt;em&gt;tested&lt;/em&gt; for mismatch repair deficiency. If the cancer has this kind of genetic mutation it would certainly be worth discussing the possibility of employing Jemperli with an oncologist knowledgeable about its benefits and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What About Side Effects?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer drugs have side effects. That is a given. Sometimes those adverse reactions can be life threatening. Patients are often willing to take that risk because the cancer is also life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this clinical trial about 40% of the patients did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; experience adverse events. The most common complication was fatigue, affecting 23% of patients. Rash or dermatitis affected 21% and itching was a problem for 19% of those participating in the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The authors add:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The following grade 3 adverse events occurred in one patient each: diabetes, lung infection, hypothyroidism, encephalitis, and neutropenia. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in one patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those more serious side effects would appear to have been relatively rare in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One More BIG Downside to This Potential Cancer Breakthrough:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old habits die hard. Most oncologists have been taught that solid tumors must be cut out first, followed by chemo and/or radiation therapy. Getting them to consider immunotherapy out of the starting gate could be challenging, even with the impressive results of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; study was Dr. Andrea Cercek. She is the Section Head of Colorectal Cancer and founder and co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“The bottom line is that everyone did benefit. No one was harmed. It takes home the message that therapy like this can lead to significant clinical complete responses, tumor downstaging, and significant improvement in the quality of life of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“I see this as utilizing an incredibly effective approach in early-stage disease where we can use immunotherapy and with the majority of these tumors, replace standard of care and surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;“These weren’t super baby-sized tumors. There were definitely some that were Stage III. But we didn’t see any differences in tumor stage and how patients responded. We think that as long as there is not distant disease, or metastases, patients could benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But please remember, these patients all had the rare, &lt;strong&gt;dMMR&lt;/strong&gt;-type solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Another Downside:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the cost. This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive drug. The price is projected around $11,500 per infusion and there would need to be roughly &lt;em&gt;nine&lt;/em&gt; infusions administered over six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies are likely to deny coverage for Jemperli &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; guideline committees recommend it for treatment of a specific dMMR solid tumor (with mismatch repair-deficient characteristics). It can take guideline committees a long time to change their recommendations. And that means insurance companies are likely to deny coverage until there is a clear green light from the “experts.” There is also FDA approval to contend with. As I write this, the FDA has rather limited “indications” for the use of Jemperli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The FDA has approved Jemperli for:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endometrial Cancer in combination with chemotherapy or when the tumor is mismatch repair deficient (dMMR).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mismatch Repair Deficient Recurrent or Advanced Solid Tumors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the FDA has not yet approved is early treatment of solid dMMR tumors. That will hopefully change in the near future now that the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40293177/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has published research that has made headlines around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The People's Pharmacy</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:08:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPcjZBZVB6WVNlVGpZamN4VkQxMUk2VkQ2UTc1VGVKcmljVzBiM3dYaHRVZXY4NG9FSGJtS0YzaXJkQXFzdElLYkRKV2FLQWhDempYN21Gb1Z3X3UzeUQzbUhSZHZMdy1oTjlQdGVpeFM1d0NEcTFWOGpnWFFVNWhKNG5XRDAxZk9HSHJJX2ZHOS1yNVVESXNteS1OSUtDUG8</guid></item><item><title>随着百日咳病例的增加，医生解释了如何保护自己和他人- AOL.com | With whooping cough cases on the rise, a doctor explains how to protect yourself and others - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9fYUJYZ3lhY3dfajEtTThoeWtoRGFMZjc4eVp0Q3gwQTE1MzlRZzhqUXg5TkhqRUxPdXNWMHhvSHgtNk1uR0FDenhpNm9EZEpPVzFWWTJLV2lYYzFRVlZvR2RQeHllVVVBdHI5bmJfRHVTMnNtOEs2eQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;An illustration depicts a 3D, computer-generated image of a group of Bordetella pertussis bacteria.

What vaccine is recommended to prevent it, and who should get it? Why do cases appear to be surging? And what should people who are concerned about whooping cough do protect themselves and others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What causes whooping cough?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:highly contagious respiratory illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria are spread from person to person. If someone infected with pertussis coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets are released that contain the bacteria. People nearby can become infected by breathing in the droplets. The bacteria can also be spread through prolonged close contact when people share the same breathing space — for instance, when infected people &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hold a baby;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hold a baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; generally start seven to 10 days following infection. Initially, an infected person develops symptoms similar to a cold and other mild respiratory infections, such as a low-grade fever, runny nose and cough. The cough often then progresses to a severe hacking cough that is characterized by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:violent coughing fits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;violent coughing fits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these coughing fits, people may make a high-pitched “whoop” when they try to take breaths after they cough, hence the name whooping cough. The fits may be so severe that they vomit during or afterward. Many struggle to sleep as a result. Some may have trouble breathing, and patients have been known to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:break their ribs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;break their ribs&lt;/a&gt; due to the severity of the force associated with coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pertussis is especially dangerous in infants. Globally, it is a significant cause of disease and death in infancy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 1 in 3 babies younger than 1 year old infected with pertussis will need care in the hospital, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC statistics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC statistics&lt;/a&gt; also indicate that about 1 in 5 of those hospitalized develop pneumonia, 1 in 50 have convulsions, and about 1 in 100 will die from their complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are people with preexisting health conditions that may be exacerbated by pertussis. These &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/postexposure-prophylaxis/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; those who are immunocompromised or have moderate to severe asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long does recovery take? Can anything speed it up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Length of time to recover depends on the individual. Coughing fits typically last between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one and six weeks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one and six weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but they can persist for as long as 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment for pertussis is antibiotics. There are a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:common antibiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;common antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; that are effective against pertussis, including azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. The earlier the treatment begins, the better the prognosis. Early treatment has been shown to reduce severity and the time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How is pertussis diagnosed? How long is someone contagious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; In some patients, the diagnosis can be made simply by hearing the characteristic cough. Others who are a bit more subtle will &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pertussis/symptoms-diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:require testing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;require testing&lt;/a&gt; via a nose and throat swab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with pertussis can spread the bacteria from the time their symptoms start until at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two weeks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; after coughing begins. Many cases of pertussis may be spread by people who think they have a run-of-the-mill virus before their severe coughing fits begin. Early use of antibiotics can shorten the time someone is contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What vaccine is recommended to prevent it? At what ages should it be given?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two types;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;two types&lt;/a&gt; of combination vaccines that include protection against pertussis, the DTaP vaccine and Tdap. These vaccinations include protection against tetanus (the “T” in each name) and diphtheria (the “D” and “d” in those names).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/administering-vaccine.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DTaP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt; series is five doses of the vaccine given at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months old, then 15 months through 18 months old, then 4 years through 6 years old, according to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule. Tdap is then recommended for all adolescents, with the preferred age of administration being 11 to 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who never received Tdap should receive a single dose. To maintain protection, all adults should also receive a booster &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:every 10 years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;every 10 years&lt;/a&gt;. And pregnant women are recommended one dose of Tdap during a pregnancy to be given during gestational weeks 27 through 36 to convey some antibodies to their baby. Getting the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/about-vaccine.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduces;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; the likelihood of contracting pertussis as well as the severity of the disease if one were to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why are pertussis cases increasing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The exact cause is not known, though there are some hypotheses. One is related to the Covid-19 pandemic: More people were wearing masks, isolating and taking precautions that reduced transmission of all respiratory illnesses. As a result, there were fewer pertussis cases then, with a rebound once these precautions stopped. Moreover, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a3.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccination rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for DTaP along with other childhood immunizations have been declining. This is an unfortunate development. People should be reminded that during the early part of the 20th century, before widespread availability of the pertussis vaccine, pertussis was a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:major cause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;major cause&lt;/a&gt; of childhood mortality in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What should parents and people concerned about whooping cough do protect themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Completing the DTaP series is important, as is receiving the Tdap vaccine for those who are eligible. Individuals with symptoms of pertussis should get tested so that they can know if they have pertussis and prevent spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should also know that the likelihood of spread within a household is high. In addition to good handwashing and the limiting of contact with infected people, the CDC recommends that everyone who shares a household with someone who has pertussis, even if they don’t have symptoms, should get antibiotics within 21 days of the beginning of the cough in that initial person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method of receiving antibiotics after exposure, known as post-exposure prophylaxis, can help reduce their chance of contracting pertussis. In addition, the CDC supports providing antibiotics to people at high risk of severe infection within 21 days of exposure to someone who has pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:03:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9fYUJYZ3lhY3dfajEtTThoeWtoRGFMZjc4eVp0Q3gwQTE1MzlRZzhqUXg5TkhqRUxPdXNWMHhvSHgtNk1uR0FDenhpNm9EZEpPVzFWWTJLV2lYYzFRVlZvR2RQeHllVVVBdHI5bmJfRHVTMnNtOEs2eQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，您的心脏有自己的年龄，知道它可能是心脏健康的关键-财富 | Your heart has its own age—and knowing it can be the key to cardio health, study finds -

Let’s break it down. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/"}' href="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nava Greenfield, MD,&lt;/a&gt; a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City, ticks off its attributes: “This is soothing, as it contains aloe vera, and it’s nontoxic for the skin and environment,” she says. “It’s a mineral sunscreen free of harsh chemicals, and it has broad-spectrum coverage.” Aparovich praises the ingredients. “Featuring a safe mineral filter—zinc oxide—to shield the skin, it provides reliable broad-spectrum protection while rubbing smoothly into your skin,” she says. “A great pick for dry, normal, sensitive, and dehydrated skin, it’s packed with plant-based oils like shea butter and sunflower oil to nourish the skin and protect it from moisture loss.” She adds that it also has aloe barbadensis leaf extract to hydrate and soothe, and caprylic/capric triglyceride and squalane to moisturize the skin and strengthen its barrier. Another recommendation comes from Arnold Breitbart, MD, head plastic surgeon at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://faceliftlongislandny.com"}' href="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Long Island Facelift&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve used Blue Lizard for years—way before the whole non-toxic sunscreen craze. It’s always been one of my go-tos,” he says. “It offers great sun protection, has no harsh chemicals, and it’s good on sensitive skin.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (titanuim dioxide 8%, zinc oxide 10%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic aloe, shea butter, sunflower oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, squalane&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Lotion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 5 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;EltaMD UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmptpJNicUADwGwXunMqC6TJpUEsDTJDAsh4Q43qgp24c6HYgQTGYwfEtC2q4bJX47s8c6T3RdHRAPJzxoooRLtR4J2iz5GKYPuoeDTS3J44HDpa7frVSbo3cWtP2S3CjyLJyEBEWX8fWzn9eaHNQrGWWBuh5f7kn3WD58MyBdCkzPjH711UTkNVadUrt3JTUnLKcpkBdK4zLkxsicc7EcPzaXvasuUvVRpG5CgnGgsRmwh77iq7Mbp4n5ig11k5PwzwpykJZRHA8wY2sc1Ve31MwBX4ruRNdpbQUgv","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"EltaMD","dangerousHed":"UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Antioxidant-Protection-Environmental-Aggressors/dp/B079YXK3L8","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":1,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9","brand":{"name":"EltaMD"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Antioxidant-Protection-Environmental-Aggressors/dp/B079YXK3L8","price":"$45","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmptpJNicUADwGwXunMqC6TJpUEsDTJDAsh4Q43qgp24c6HYgQTGYwfEtC2q4bJX47s8c6T3RdHRAPJzxoooRLtR4J2iz5GKYPuoeDTS3J44HDpa7frVSbo3cWtP2S3CjyLJyEBEWX8fWzn9eaHNQrGWWBuh5f7kn3WD58MyBdCkzPjH711UTkNVadUrt3JTUnLKcpkBdK4zLkxsicc7EcPzaXvasuUvVRpG5CgnGgsRmwh77iq7Mbp4n5ig11k5PwzwpykJZRHA8wY2sc1Ve31MwBX4ruRNdpbQUgv","reducedPrice":"$36","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;EltaMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for sensitive skin, this tinted face sunscreen blurs imperfections in a range of skin tones while infusing the skin with health-boosting antioxidants.

An expert in eczema and psoriasis, she adds that the formula is soothing on skin that’s irritated from either condition. With a lightweight, fluid texture, the sunscreen sinks right into the skin, drying with a matte finish. It’s enriched with a bit of proprietary magic, too: La Roche-Posay’s Cell-Ox Shield technology combines UVA and UVB filters with antioxidant sun protection from tropical-leaf extracts. The brand’s signature ingredient—thermal spring water from the French town La Roche-Posay—is also present in the formula, bringing a soothing touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (titanium dioxide 6%, zinc oxide 5%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin E, botanical extracts, La Roche-Posay thermal spring water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Fluid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.7 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Forah Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/MqMVDRsypCNABGRAF3G9ShJzHnHMfw21qcGRBQ8uefVwJ9ZNKynTuqSgcEivopzQHW9ATb4nj6ofNsg4bP2xgQCc9xof5WgWFp3Sswj5gy57FsjtpTj9H1H1DKz1hL6gJNqaCsBRPCBJuBdzT1Lh93a1wGTQdXEjg1v3xCQpsLqfnnHpHErQTfMC9nyH5a8M3pK424VZ8ki7MXWyXGGpMLwK2cEP4BumCgv9QNTEnfhEDyAQtX6J6p4C2byLYrLTtCnCJwWzKkLJDvhtAJJmxzYX9UBgBfci","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Forah","dangerousHed":"Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"MODA OPERANDI","offerUrl":"https://www.modaoperandi.com/beauty/p/forah/everyday-mineral-sunscreen/663791","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":3,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe","brand":{"name":"Forah"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.modaoperandi.com/beauty/p/forah/everyday-mineral-sunscreen/663791","price":"$55","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/MqMVDRsypCNABGRAF3G9ShJzHnHMfw21qcGRBQ8uefVwJ9ZNKynTuqSgcEivopzQHW9ATb4nj6ofNsg4bP2xgQCc9xof5WgWFp3Sswj5gy57FsjtpTj9H1H1DKz1hL6gJNqaCsBRPCBJuBdzT1Lh93a1wGTQdXEjg1v3xCQpsLqfnnHpHErQTfMC9nyH5a8M3pK424VZ8ki7MXWyXGGpMLwK2cEP4BumCgv9QNTEnfhEDyAQtX6J6p4C2byLYrLTtCnCJwWzKkLJDvhtAJJmxzYX9UBgBfci","sellerName":"MODA OPERANDI","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""},{"offerUrl":"https://goop.com/forah-everyday-mineral-face-sunscreen-spf-30/85-ml/p/","price":"$55","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/39ZGmWZ6fEZzHe7YCVBsPbWd3Z8y9YDDNAXuPTiE7vgKsDKX7hsdk5W91q7YRRhcdGbX5XSE7dXWBRLa5bvVnpQESiwyeW9gw6H3CC7NUpqeKMbiPjTGtS1duYCiWUfVk78muMsLg5tQ8iaXNerhDKDr3QQFW1nZ7J3PkqDqYE3ZfYcJm5yqkmTR9QDQpcUKCjicvGKPs6aSntLs9bm73D77BvPpKfLD2VhTLHznUAY8uFyfhGcGC1HN5vXM52YVv6KCfe9MQV4HUUcJg5g52Vc","sellerName":"GOOP","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Forah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Like the Erewhon smoothie of sunscreens, Forah’s SPF 30 formula blends a cocktail of antioxidant-packed ingredients—think organic sea buckthorn oil, organic cold-pressed golden jojoba oil, and organic sweet almond oil—that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; sound good enough to drink. (Please don’t, though.) Greenfield can hardly get enough of the luxurious, chicly packaged sun protection, which is also loaded with collagen-boosting botanical extracts. “It’s certified organic, which I love,” she says. “It has both zinc and titanium dioxide along with antioxidants, natural-based oils, and seaweed extract, which hydrate and protect the skin.

(In addition to the pinkish Original hue, the formula comes in the warm, golden Sunlit shade.) “While protecting your skin from sun damage, the smart formula also blends skincare ingredients like ceramides, peptides, galactoarabinan, bioflavonoids, allantoin, and glycoproteins,” Aparovich continues. “These moisturize and comfort the skin, and support its protective barrier throughout UV exposure.” She adds that the sunscreen works for dry and normal skin types, and is also suitable for sensitive skin. Pro tip: If using it as a makeup base, let the product dry for three to five minutes before layering it with other products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (non-nano zinc oxide 21.7%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ceramides, peptides, allantoin, hyaluronic acid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 40&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Fluid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.3 oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Face Shield Flex SPF 50&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/nntVzjQ3JMLounBBCrovvH9o7LcZBctrz8uZ7TYUsqJvV9xwePfNHrMLEsZWBqbLBkUpp7zQGTrdJVD3xqMB239o6c73Gjfdi6h3oyDioRApzbQTje2EyVqKEQiV26Pt7tjdWUuRGtWRqis4tY2tQSeMPNUVq6MV6sn2axGUzj52bJTrVtqBQShjUTgPPFVF64mCdPMkirfrQm52N39kYoGNTvgZbkwiT4YcxQJSatxbZVcAiakyUqX7udKueSUuM5m6t5Lf3vRp8nP2Y6Xa3KHc8SzKs3bmogKbP6Aa","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Colorescience","dangerousHed":"Total Protection Flex SPF 50","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colorescience-Protection-Shield-Formula-Medium/dp/B093W7CDWD","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":5,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246","brand":{"name":"Colorescience"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colorescience-Protection-Shield-Formula-Medium/dp/B093W7CDWD","price":"$54","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/nntVzjQ3JMLounBBCrovvH9o7LcZBctrz8uZ7TYUsqJvV9xwePfNHrMLEsZWBqbLBkUpp7zQGTrdJVD3xqMB239o6c73Gjfdi6h3oyDioRApzbQTje2EyVqKEQiV26Pt7tjdWUuRGtWRqis4tY2tQSeMPNUVq6MV6sn2axGUzj52bJTrVtqBQShjUTgPPFVF64mCdPMkirfrQm52N39kYoGNTvgZbkwiT4YcxQJSatxbZVcAiakyUqX7udKueSUuM5m6t5Lf3vRp8nP2Y6Xa3KHc8SzKs3bmogKbP6Aa","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Colorescience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Total Protection Flex SPF 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; With tone-adapting pigments, Colorescience’s smart SPF 50 comes in four shades ranging from Fair to Deep. “Combining skincare and sun protection, this tinted sunscreen adapts to various skin tones and provides a matte finish,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"}' href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist in Manhattan and New Jersey.

“This Grown Alchemist SPF is not only non-toxic, it is a vegan formulation,” says Dr. Greenfield. “It uses natural ingredients such as rosehip oil, castor seed oil, lavender oil, coconut oil, and calendula for a hydrating and smooth application.” But moisturizing the skin isn’t its only capability. “This also has almost 20% zinc oxide for a tested and strong SPF,” Dr. Greenfield adds. The zinc oxide in question is ultra-sheer, so it vanishes into the skin without a trace—hence, the brand describes this hydrating salve as “invisible natural protection.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (zinc oxide 19%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Castor seed oil, rosehip seed oil, lavender oil, parsley seed oil, candelilla wax, coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 30&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Lightweight cream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.69 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fig. 1 Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/9fJ5Pb5roi2FBR7jmAU7qvp49uMDd91koJk937chytUFKQWEMrBb8y5j1mCnQgHTNrkf2YtNt1EJvHfaW5p5SWs7Zs8mVB1dGcM6Szhae4F19CDAmBF2WMsfLDNjJhwhSkcXkXKsRi3eqoPdE9XTudFhYpaN48nEAA1aJkTaWr6WddNHH1DVEkecCCxLFLaPeXg1VMdBX8PkYEUWYQyKzhWsxce7pE5YLvZgKQ6anio5ma2Vc1Zke3sYvuA9GZMAmAuYVDCFx","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Fig.1","dangerousHed":"Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"NORDSTROM","offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mineral-sunscreen-spf-50/8330143","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a24209719135fb3562d","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":8,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a24209719135fb3562d","brand":{"name":"Fig.1"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mineral-sunscreen-spf-50/8330143","price":"$38","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/9fJ5Pb5roi2FBR7jmAU7qvp49uMDd91koJk937chytUFKQWEMrBb8y5j1mCnQgHTNrkf2YtNt1EJvHfaW5p5SWs7Zs8mVB1dGcM6Szhae4F19CDAmBF2WMsfLDNjJhwhSkcXkXKsRi3eqoPdE9XTudFhYpaN48nEAA1aJkTaWr6WddNHH1DVEkecCCxLFLaPeXg1VMdBX8PkYEUWYQyKzhWsxce7pE5YLvZgKQ6anio5ma2Vc1Zke3sYvuA9GZMAmAuYVDCFx","sellerName":"NORDSTROM","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""},{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Sunscreen-Invisible-Absorbing-Spectrum-Hyaluronic/dp/B0D5YT5H6D","price":"$29","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/2AtUUZ8dMcfSbovr3cnyWyC643bj2hmBJnYQnbFE5LjJNrRk1F2Kf41zHbs3nSy87zqR67iLUgmmQiFetVAa3FUmA37fPHagmVUvFFMAonJMUTfsHN5aQvzPQECdgbX45c53TZracWvYU2azSSsPNopXV8ifugmtPNttaWCmNLmWUnQr3aSgBtN4GqmaWJcNqHwEqmvPxu8WExt948CTFZeWSqQLCbz97c5oka71z1sF2BWtsqH7Nh996pc3gbqF6E782p6qbRned43eL7xhgXHxsER3r1pmoxvPa3Wgn7pBp","reducedPrice":"$23","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Fig.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a24209719135fb3562d" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Dermatologist-developed and clinically tested.

Squalane, triglycerides, and meadowfoam seed oil support the skin barrier, and bisabolol soothes the skin.” With a milky texture, the sunscreen blends into the skin with an undetectable finish, and the product is fragrance-free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt;

According to Dr. Day, “Vanicream Facial Moisturizer with SPF 30 offers a practical, cost-effective solution for daily sun protection, particularly for individuals with sensitive skin.” She adds that Vanicream is a long-standing leader in hypoallergenic skincare and is known to formulate its sunscreens without common irritants. “This makes this product a dependable option for my eczema and psoriasis patients seeking broad-spectrum SPF in a well-tolerated, affordable moisturizer," she notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt;

It means that neither UV filters nor any auxiliary ingredients, such as stabilizers, emulsifiers, film-forming agents, preservatives, or fragrances, can induce known or suspected hazards, including skin irritation and sensitization, allergic reactions, endocrine disruptions, genotoxicity, and more,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s commonly thought that, in sunscreens, “non-toxic” refers to mineral sunscreens only, Aparovich dispels the myth. “From a human safety standpoint, sunscreen formulas may include both mineral (physical) and/or organic (chemical) filters, with no adverse effects associated with them,” she stipulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="traditional" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are non-toxic sunscreens as good as traditional sunscreens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mineral or non-toxic sunscreens are just as effective as traditional sunscreens when used correctly,” says Dr. Day. “For my patients with eczema or psoriasis, I actually prefer them. They’re less likely to cause stinging, burning, or flares, and provide excellent broad-spectrum protection.” Just like any sunscreen, she says, non-toxic ones need to be applied generously and reapplied often, especially after sweating or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="lookfor" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to Look for in a Non-Toxic Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Aparovich advocates looking for a sunscreen formula suited to an individual’s skin type. “People with oily, combination, or acne-prone skin should opt for products free from comedogenic ingredients to avoid clogging pores and triggering inflammation, blackheads, or breakouts,” she says. These ingredients include cacao, palm, coconut, and wheat germ oils, and chemicals like cetylated lanolin alcohol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl linoleate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl palmitate, myristyl lactate, myristyl myristate, laureth-4, oleyl alcohol, and ethylhexyl palmitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the ingredients with the highest comedogenicity rate,” she says. People with dry or sensitive skin should avoid harsh alcohols, such as alcohol, alcohol denat, ethanol, or SD alcohol, Aparovich adds. “These ingredients can compromise the skin’s barrier and cause irritation.” Additionally, she notes that an ideal non-toxic sunscreen should provide broad-spectrum protection to shield the skin from UVA and UVB rays and help reduce the risk of complex DNA damage in skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another key point is sunscreen’s sun protection factor, or SPF,” she says. “It indicates how effectively sunscreen can protect your skin from UVB rays, the ultraviolet light associated with sunburn.” Aparovich recommends choosing sunscreens with at least SPF 30, but ideally SPF 50, especially when the UV index is three or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="naturalsunscreen" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a 100% natural sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technically, there are sunscreens that claim to be 100% natural, but that term isn’t regulated,” Dr. Day says. “What matters more is that the product is clinically tested, well-tolerated by sensitive skin, and free of known irritants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="ingredients" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ingredients should you avoid in sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three of the most hazardous chemical filters to avoid are oxybenzone (benzophenone-3), homosalate, and octinoxate,” says Aparovich. “Studies have shown oxybenzone to be a common allergen, as well as an irritant to the eyes and skin, and a potential endocrine disruptor.” She adds that homosalate and octinoxate are linked to possible adverse effects on the endocrine system, and that all three ingredients have been shown to have a negative impact on marine life and coral reefs. Additionally, Aparovich recommends avoiding formaldehyde-releasing preservatives like Imidazolidinyl Urea, Quaternium 15, and Diazolidinyl Urea, along with fragrances classified as allergenic, such as cinnamal, citral, farnesol, coumarin, eugenol, geraniol, and others. “These chemicals can trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation,” she notes. Dr. Garshick recommends seeking paraben-free products, as the ingredient can irritate some skin types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://valerieaparovich.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://valerieaparovich.com/"}' href="https://valerieaparovich.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Valerie Aparovich&lt;/a&gt; is a certified cosmetologist, aesthetician, and biochemist at OnSkin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Arnold Breitbart, MD, is the head plastic surgeon at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://faceliftlongislandny.com"}' href="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Long Island Facelift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.zesthealth.com/providers/rachel-day" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.zesthealth.com/providers/rachel-day"}' href="https://www.zesthealth.com/providers/rachel-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rachel Day, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a board-certified dermatologist and Chief Medical Officer at Zest Health, a virtual dermatology clinic specializing in eczema and psoriasis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"}' href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;, is a board-certified dermatologist serving patients in Manhattan, New York, and Englewood, New Jersey.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/"}' href="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nava Greenfield, MD,&lt;/a&gt; is a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.drhadleyking.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.drhadleyking.com/"}' href="https://www.drhadleyking.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Hadley King, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 22:56:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5fb3NrUXp3U0hZdjJhWDEzVlI5dVRUOHRCam1lcWc0LUx2VjAyWXN2b2gySzhkTFktX0otN25ZRThFbUNzQlNiSVMzd3p4VzRrUWxSVHlpZmZ2OFlnSGJwdmYwNWIwQQ</guid></item><item><title>HHS吹捧通用流感，冠状病毒疫苗计划，同时对季节性Covid-19疫苗的未来表示怀疑- CNN | HHS touts universal flu, coronavirus vaccine initiative while casting doubt on future of seasonal Covid-19 shots - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNQW5fejNuZG9zekNsUmNsaFpFQ0pFeU9fSzFqelRHTUFYTjJOWHF3T3M4andBOXpVZ0dzbmtRYTZ0S2hlSXF5X1c4ZGdhdEJwcTdvMEI2NldPVEdGMkl4N0lHaGY3Z0V0ZlBjYlNPRG1pWUJTVUVpVkxZLXRTZ3NHWjZGeWZFOEs5S2FBTU55MnpqNmhP0gGUAUFVX3lxTE5nRlRjbFNiNWg4Ql9wYlplVlVXWVBiTnFUUkFjM3FMZ1NVVmdDNUwxcjBuaVZFVnlQcVpKazZQOFE3eWYxc3NkdUJlRHBUdXBWUmszU3M3amFlNGZEZVVpQlVmS3pJdnUtdEdFTWtQMnNJMmJqem8wV0JNTEQzblhGa0xIM2d0ZlBKTHlzeGlJZk96SGQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The US Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that it aims to accomplish within four years a scientific feat that hasn’t been achieved&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the past 45: the development of a universal flu vaccine that could protect against multiple virus strains with pandemic potential, including H5N1 avian influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00022e6a0aeu0g9q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;on the new initiative. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00032e6a61zknvgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said the project, being developed in-house at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is targeting US Food and Drug Administration approval of universal influenza vaccines in 2029, with human clinical trials scheduled to start next year. The Wall Street Journal first reported that it will be funded with $500 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a figure confirmed by a spokesperson for HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00042e6aqpdv4zvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope it works,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He noted that he trained in a flu lab in the early 1980s that was working on a universal flu vaccine, and one still hasn’t been developed. “It’s not for lack of effort, and it’s not for lack of expertise, and it’s not for lack of money that we don’t have a universal influenza vaccine. It’s just really hard to do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00052e6adojvt4q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu viruses are wily because they mutate from season to season, sometimes significantly, and because efforts to protect against all – or many – strains at once haven’t succeeded, we get updated flu shots each year to protect us against the latest circulating strains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00062e6aua4xa41p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar paradigm has unfolded for Covid-19 vaccines since they were first authorized in the height of the pandemic at the end of 2020. HHS’s new initiative also aims to develop universal coronavirus vaccines that could provide protection against not just the virus that causes Covid-19 – SARS-CoV-2 – but its cousins SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00072e6abhm5b8uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine technology in HHS’s new initiative uses inactivated whole-virus vaccines, an older approach that delivers an entire virus that’s been chemically tweaked so it can’t infect human cells. The project comes from work being driven by Dr. Matthew Memoli, the NIH’s principal deputy director, and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, acting director of NIAID.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00082e6avjt9q1u8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Memoli, who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/health/nih-interim-director-memoli/index.html"&gt;gained attention&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 for opposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates and reportedly declined Covid-19 vaccination himself, said in &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/trial-potential-universal-flu-vaccine-opens-nih-clinical-center" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; that one of the vaccines being advanced in this project, which can potentially be administered through a squirt up the nose, is an attempt “to induce a comprehensive immune response that closely mimics immunity gained following a natural influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00092e6aln93g0hb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts who are not involved in the project said universal flu and coronavirus vaccines are a worthy goal, but they questioned whether this project could produce one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000a2e6a6djbjb6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Greg Poland, who directs the vaccine research group at the Mayo Clinic, said the accepted scientific definition of a universal flu vaccine is one that would provide at least 75% protection against symptomatic infection with both A and B strain flu viruses for at least a year, and preferably over multiple seasons, for all age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000b2e6ase877hqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland says &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2167" target="_blank"&gt;research that’s been published&lt;/a&gt; on the most advanced candidate in the new initiative, BPL-1357, describes a vaccine that contains inert versions of four A-strain avian influenza viruses but doesn’t include any B-strain viruses, “which tells me they’re not aiming at seasonal viruses,” he said. “They’re aiming at those viruses that have the potential for pandemicity,” or the potential to start pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000c2e6av2p3aj0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland said he was also surprised by the amount of money being devoted to a vaccine technology that science has largely moved away from.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000d2e6a30iclfc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would we devise a major program and devote a tremendous amount of resources to an old platform?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5qxpnw00003b6mscvltou0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advantage of using whole viruses is that they give the body a chance to develop antibodies to many parts of a virus, which tends to create long-lasting protection, even if some parts of the virus mutate. But they can also cause unwanted side effects and adverse reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5rvfok00003b6mcv0d3ny1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole virus vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs or cells. In this case, the vaccines under study are grown in canine kidney cells. Those viruses are treated with a chemical called beta-propiolactone, which prevents them from being able to copy themselves in the body and infect cells. The inactivated viruses are then purified and mixed into a shot or nasal spray.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r6xwi00023b6mgwt4faw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US used to use flu vaccines made from whole inactivated viruses but has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473132/" target="_blank"&gt;moved to safer options&lt;/a&gt;, such as subunit or split virus vaccines, which use only a part of the flu virus to create an immune response. Flumist, a nasal spray, uses a whole but weakened version of the virus, so it’s not completely inactivated. Inactivated whole-virus flu vaccines are still used in some other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000e2e6avupyvwey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland and another vaccine expert, Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, said whole-virus vaccines were once more common, but developers moved away from them because they produce inoculations that are sometimes too strong and can provoke dangerous immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5t2pa0000g3b6mi9g3nlmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m guessing it’s going to be quite reactogenic,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000f2e6ald1wh0wn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He pointed to the 1976 swine flu vaccine, which produced a strong immune response to the whole virus it contained but also caused high rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune disorder in which the body attacks its own nerves and muscles, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000g2e6ax8dtflg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other whole-virus vaccines, including the first ones developed to fight respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, have caused problems such as immune enhancement, where exposure to the virus after vaccination makes the infection more dangerous, not less.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000h2e6aoccdpuuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a bit of a head-scratcher why they have so much confidence in a whole inactivated virus approach. I don’t quite understand that,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r89m1000b3b6m5v7vvzeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just before it announced its new universal vaccine development plan, late Wednesday HHS threw into question the future of seasonally updated Covid-19 vaccines. The agency said in a statement that “all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000o2e6aoa2obk0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA typically selects strains for updated Covid-19 vaccines in June so manufacturers can ready them for the fall respiratory virus season. The agency has adopted a system similar to the one used for flu vaccines, holding previously that updating only the strain targeted by the vaccine – and nothing else – didn’t represent a change big enough to require new human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000p2e6aoprfax5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If HHS now requires placebo-controlled trials before clearing updated Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, that could delay availability of the shots by months, putting vulnerable people at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000q2e6a7m4zlnyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The advantage of updating the vaccine every year to make it more close to the circulating strain is, you get better antibody responses, so for four to six months, you will clearly have better protection against mild to moderate disease, and that matters especially for people who are more frail,” particularly people 75 and older, Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000r2e6am4tf0spr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS didn’t respond to an inquiry about whether the new guidance pertains to updated Covid-19 vaccines, but an official told CNN on Saturday that “the covid vaccines, including new ones by Pfizer and Moderna, are new and must have more gold standard science to ensure safety and efficacy for the public.” The official drew a distinction from the flu shot, “which has been tried and tested” for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000s2e6a2vt8694e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Questions about the fate of Covid vaccines began to swirl after the FDA missed an April 1 deadline to decide whether to grant full approval to the Novavax vaccine, the only non-mRNA vaccine available to protect against the coronavirus. A source familiar with the situation, who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, told CNN that the vaccine had been on track to be approved.

            Novavax later &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;the FDA had requested a “postmarketing commitment” for a clinical trial, suggesting that a study would be required of the vaccine after it received full approval (it had been available through emergency use authorization since 2022). HHS’s newest statement adds to questions about whether a trial would be required before approval, not just for Novavax’s vaccine but also for updated versions of those from Moderna and Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday, Moderna President Dr. Stephen Hoge insisted that the company’s interactions with the FDA so far have been “business as usual” and emphasized the “real need for Covid vaccination, particularly this coming fall.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Covid-19 has become less deadly since the height of the pandemic as the population developed widespread immunity through both infection and vaccination, but the virus still kills and can be especially dangerous for the elderly. Between September 2023 and August 2024, there were more than 36,000 deaths from Covid-19 among people 65 and older, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This month may reveal whether the FDA shares Moderna’s “business as usual” approach. The company is expecting FDA decisions on a next-generation Covid-19 vaccine by May 31 and on an expansion of approval for its RSV vaccine into younger ages by June 12. It said an FDA decision on its combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine would be pushed back from the end of this year to 2026, as the agency said it requires efficacy data on the flu component to support the application.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000x2e6ax3c6uzlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company also said it’s going to “de-prioritize” development of the combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine for people under the age of 50, instead focusing on advancing it for older adults, as it shifts some resources to cancer therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cma5pxsao001f2e6a9lnjwg4e@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="changing-standards-may-delay-shots" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            If the FDA does require placebo-controlled trials before approving updated seasonal Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, it will signal a new standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000z2e6agyz844vg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “FDA clearly, after a deliberative process, adopted an approach that treated Covid-19 vaccine boosters like influenza boosters, not like a new product, and held to that over a few years,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “They adopted a standard, and now they’re changing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00102e6afm9653dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency does appear to be moving forward at least with the process of selecting strains; it’s asked its group of outside advisers to hold May 22 as a date to meet to discuss them, according to a person who viewed the communication who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00112e6amljitbmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its statement Wednesday, HHS also claimed that current systems for monitoring vaccine safety, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, don’t capture vaccine injuries sufficiently and “have become templates of regulatory malpractice.” HHS said it’s building surveillance systems now “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00122e6a51qqpznu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts pushed back on the assertion that those systems are insufficient. And the plan to build a different surveillance system appeared to come into direct conflict with a pledge that Sen. Bill Cassidy said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to secure his confirmation vote in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00132e6a5yy5upio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00142e6au5v8nza2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, said in &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/chair-cassidy-applauds-hhs-nih-initiative-to-develop-universal-vaccine-platform" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that universal vaccines have been considered “the Holy Grail solution to protect Americans from quickly mutating viruses” and that he’s glad to see the administration prioritizing this area of research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5y4bkp00003b6mm7blq2ws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for testing new versions of Covid vaccines, he said, “The first vaccine for a disease is already proven safe through a placebo-controlled trial. Updating that vaccine does not require a new placebo-controlled trial to determine its safety. To require a placebo group would deny those patients access to the vaccine that has already been found safe.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

However, the new immuno-based treatment would only require a single step — immunotherapy — to treat the cancer by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and three patients participated in the study, 54 with a variety of "solid tumor cancers," including stomach, endometrial and prostate, and 49 with rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/using-only-immunotherapy-successfully-treats-several-cancers-with-mmrd-mutation-improves-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that of the 54 patients with a “variety of cancers," 35 had “all signs of their cancer” disappear and were using the immuno-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith Collection/Gado/Getty &lt;/p&gt; Sign with logo on the facade of the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center in Manhattan, New York City, New York, among the top cancer hospitals in the world, September 14, 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/milk-might-lower-womans-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-study-8772735" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the release, Dr. Andrea Cercek said, "Nearly 2 out of 3 patients with types of cancer other than rectal were able to preserve their organs and their quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very significant response, and the results were even better than we had hoped,” Dr. Cercek said. “We found that some cancer types responded extremely well to the immunotherapy, including colon and stomach cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&lt;/p&gt; Maureen Sideris, seated, with her sister Marion, receiving the 8th of 9 immunotherapy infusions during successful treatment for early-stage gastroesophageal junction cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maureen Sideris, a patient who was diagnosed with gastroesophageal junction cancer in 2022 and participated in the study, said that the treatment had worked successfully for her, according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband, Tommy, and I were preparing for the worst,” she recalled in a statement. “But after being treated with only immunotherapy, I had no evidence of cancer and didn’t have to undergo surgery or chemo or radiation. I felt like I won the lottery!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cerek reported that “20% of non-rectal cancer patients” who still had to undergo surgery “saw lower rates of cancer recurrence."

Researchers said that one patient had a “growth in a lymph node” that was surgically removed but they “kept their rectum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers said that the new treatment comes with its own drawbacks as the immunotherapy drug appeared to only work well with patients who had mismatch repair-deficiency, which means certain cells have mutations when cancer cells separate, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/mismatch-repair-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the NCI, this mutation “is most common” in “colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer" and can also be found in “cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder and thyroid.” The immunotherapy drug works by targeting cells with this mutation, as the immunotherapy drug can more easily target the many mutations, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really excited to help more people,” Dr. Cercek said. “And we are already exploring why rectal tissue seems to have such an extraordinary response to immunotherapy and how we can use that knowledge to help with other cancer types.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/immunotherapy-breakthrough-could-mean-fewer-cancer-patients-need-chemo-11724110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 22:05:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQYW0wMm9VT3B3ckN3TGktR3Y1VXlpSmhHR1lKWVp6WUZEczdFRHFsSURVMjNocWduQlpLXzFRbDVmVmlTQUNxeVZUamwyQVBhNC1mOEVyT0lYaW9HZzlTY1RSVDh0THNfV0Fac29fclhKSFgxVW9jX0xmQVBtUUlrTmctY21SQQ</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新研究，您应该多吃2种食物以减少炎症- EatingWell | 2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFA4Vjc1eFVMSEpwbnVrNmVkeEdfVU9SMnBrZVJkZUkwaVowTmVPOHZrbTI4Y2t5ZkNGMW9nOVdHT2FybnhiY0xQQ25qOFEtUU5JV05ZVnBmcS1IdTdiNHF4S3h0YzBCdHpaZnVfeF9BbUU2ZTQ4S1o5R2FoZ2hSdnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that higher plant protein and fiber intake are linked with less inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High animal protein and low fiber intake were associated with more inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the level of total protein intake, higher levels of inflammation were seen in those with low fiber intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is the body’s healing response to injury or infection. When you sprain your ankle, it swells up because your body releases compounds to help it heal. As it heals, those inflammatory compounds are lessened. Similar processes happen when you get sick with an illness, except the inflammation may or may not be so obvious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While inflammation is a necessary part of healing, when that inflammation doesn’t go away and becomes chronic, it raises your risk of disease, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Many things can cause chronic inflammation, including stress and diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers in the United Kingdom took a closer look at diet—specifically, protein sources and fiber—and how they relate to inflammation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The data in this study came from the UK Biobank, a large database that contains medical, lifestyle and health information from about 500,000 UK residents. For this study, researchers used data from 128,612 participants who were at least 60 years old and fit the study criteria. The research team only included participants who had dietary data and bloodwork that included C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on file. CRP is a common measurement of inflammation in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers categorized participants into two groups: individuals who had one or no chronic health conditions (based on a list of 43 such conditions) and individuals who reported having two or more of those chronic conditions, which is referred to as multimorbidity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on food diaries from the participants, researchers recorded total protein intake for the participants and split the protein up between animal protein and plant protein. For this study, plant protein included tempeh, tofu, beans (legumes), lentils, nuts and seeds. Animal protein included red meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy. In addition, participants’ fiber intake was calculated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers adjusted for factors like age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcohol intake, height and weight. Participants self-reported medical diagnoses from a list of 43 conditions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on their dietary information and CRP levels, participants were divided into groups: high total protein, low total protein, high dietary fiber and low dietary fiber. These groups were further split up, with low, middle and high categories in plant protein, animal protein and dietary fiber. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After statistical analyses were run, researchers found that plant-based protein and high-fiber foods may help lower inflammation in the body. Specifically, they observed that: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Participants eating a diet low in fiber and high in animal proteins experienced higher inflammation levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among participants with high, middle and low protein intake, higher inflammation levels were always observed for those who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had low fiber intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In those without multimorbidity (two or more chronic diseases), higher plant protein and fiber intake resulted in lower levels of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; multimorbidity (two or more chronic illnesses), the association between protein, fiber and inflammation was stronger compared to those without multimorbidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, as plant protein and fiber intake increased, inflammation levels decreased. The opposite was found regarding animal protein and total protein, which exhibited a significant positive association with C-reactive protein (CRP), which was measured to gauge inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this study. First, the study population was largely white British older adults, so it is unknown if these results also apply to other populations. It’s also worth noting that when participants self-report their conditions and dietary habits, there’s always a chance that some data may be incomplete or misremembered. Lastly, CRP levels were only measured at baseline, so they might not be indicative of ongoing chronic inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that inflammation plays a starring role in chronic illness. The trick is finding out what’s causing it. This study suggests that consuming high amounts of animal protein and too little fiber are associated with higher levels of inflammation, but that higher intakes of fiber and plant protein are linked with less inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber plays an important role in gut health, providing food for beneficial gut bacteria. There is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome is linked with lower inflammation levels, so it makes sense that plant protein and other sources of fiber would be associated with lower CRP levels. And this relationship is bi-directional—gut health influences inflammation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-inflammation-harm-your-gut-health-8715529" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation influences gut health&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If this is all overwhelming, a good place to start is with gut health. We know that fiber feeds the beneficial gut bacteria and plant protein provides fiber, so start there. What sources of plant protein can you add to your diet? Where can you swap an animal protein meal with a plant protein one? &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Higher protein plant sources&lt;/a&gt; include legumes, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and certain whole grains, like quinoa and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/didietitian-favorite-high-protein-whole-grain-amaranth-8401947" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;amaranth&lt;/a&gt;. This weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based diet meal plan&lt;/a&gt; provides a framework to get you going. Use it as is or pick out a few recipes to try. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other plants—including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits, vegetables&lt;/a&gt; and whole grains—even if they aren’t considered high-protein, are also important to include for overall good health and gut health, as they provide fiber, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You also need plenty of beneficial bacteria—aka probiotics—to nosh on the fiber you’re feeding them. You can add probiotics with fermented foods, so add a little sauerkraut or kimchi to your diet each day. If that’s not appealing, then go with yogurt or kefir.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another limitation of this study is that it didn’t break down healthier sources of animal proteins from less healthy ones. For example, yogurt and kefir are sources of animal proteins that provide probiotics and other necessary nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D. And fish and other seafood provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920'" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain- and heart-healthy omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; in addition to protein. But these proteins were all lumped together with other sources of animal proteins, even though they provide a wealth of essential nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We believe that all foods can fit into a balanced, varied diet. So, for example, while you might not want to eat a hamburger each day, now and then is probably fine. Instead of cutting things out, focus on packing your diet with nutrient-dense foods that have been linked with lower levels of inflammation and disease—like plant protein—while sprinkling in other foods you enjoy on occasion—like a burger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other lifestyle habits have also been linked with better gut health and lower levels of inflammation, including exercise and lower levels of stress. So, move your body more often and examine the areas where stress needs to be lowered. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; suggests that higher plant protein and fiber intake is associated with lower levels of inflammation, and that higher intakes of animal protein and lower fiber intake are linked with higher levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating more plants, including high-protein plants, is important for overall health and disease prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Find easy ways to add more plant protein and fiber into your diet and start swapping animal protein for plant protein here and there. Some tasty ways to do this are by replacing the meat in tacos with tofu, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7891013/chipotle-tofu-tacos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chipotle Tofu Tacos&lt;/a&gt;, or beans, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/crispy-sheet-pan-black-bean-tacos-11699837" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Crispy Sheet-Pan Black Bean Tacos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

Kennedy Jr. reprised various misleading claims about vaccines this week, including that the measles vaccine contains cells from aborted fetuses and the mumps vaccination does not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy's comments come as the U.S. battles one of its worst outbreaks of measles in 25 years. Scientists have warned that the U.S. is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, declared eradicated nationally in 2000, and say U.S. public health officials like Kennedy should provide urgent endorsement for highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two children have died and hundreds more have been infected in the outbreak in Texas, which is centered in a Mennonite community and has spread to neighboring states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy, who became the nation's top health official in February, has for decades helped sow doubts regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, contributing to a decline in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy says he is not opposed to vaccines, but has begun to revive some of the unproven or debunked theories he promoted as a lawyer and public figure, now from his perch at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There are populations in our country, like the Mennonites in Texas, (who) were most afflicted, and they have religious objections to the vaccination, because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it," he said in a News Nation interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy was referring to the combined Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine. The vaccines do not contain "fetal debris" from abortions or intact fetal cells, vaccine experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rubella portion of the vaccine is produced from a fetal cell line originating from an abortion that took place in the 1960s. The MMR vaccine does not contain the cells in its final form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cells are derived from fetal cells that have been replicated over decades in test tubes in laboratory settings, thousands of times removed from the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The virus is grown in these cells, then this virus is purified, meaning everything other than the virus is filtered out, and all that's left is this attenuated virus that can't make you sick," said Dr. Miriam Laufer, Interim Director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a fact sheet on how vaccines are made from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania, the amount of DNA involved in final vaccine preparation is minimal; billionths or trillionths of a gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"While the final vaccines do not contain intact fetal cells, they may contain trace amounts of cell-derived materials, such as fragments of DNA," said Dr. Paulo Verardi, Professor of Virology and Vaccinology and the University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also said this week that the mumps portion of the vaccine does not work and that there were safety concerns over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The problem is really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination. That combination was never safety tested," he said on Monday at a live televised town hall event hosted by TV host Dr. Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine provide around 86% protection against mumps, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While it is true that vaccine protection can wane over time, the rate varies depending on the disease and vaccine, Verardi and other vaccine experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For mumps in particular, immunity can decline, so adults vaccinated in childhood may become susceptible again. Still, vaccinated individuals generally experience a milder illness if infected, which is still a key benefit of vaccination," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington and Nancy Lapid in Tucson; Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Caroline Humer and Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 21:42:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQeFhBcHVfT29vSmNQRExlaUlKSGtxNXRkQTA5Qmo1bkEwUE9LUVM0ZTJydnpNYm9UcHlYeVl1MFh4bTJkd21kNmZuS1RZb1AwVGRXVXhZeEhqNHI3NXNIdExUWV9ObW5sc1ZEakNJTy1ET3Z6M094MVdUWmxVdk1POU5ZUQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr计划对“所有新疫苗”进行安慰剂试验测试- BBC | RFK Jr plans placebo-trial testing for 'all new vaccines' - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9Eb0s0YzFWR1pXRWhERWFYLUFCSWRYWVVvR0J4RXB5NDJycDRDRDdoLWFkaW5UY0VSVnlnd3E2Q0Z5TVhDMWJMal96akpCak5HeURmWVR3ZVFJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nTEtuSHhfV01rOVNkS3NvQ1IwQm9EV0NpWmxXMlR2cXZGVzhFMDBTa0YwNXdkM1hNVmw4LWJ1V0NzLV9SUGIzdHoxNmpyTFhBaW9ZY1RXVHJwQnlLdDdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer "straightforward" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a statement first given to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, "All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure — a radical departure from past practices". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The agency did not provide details on which "new vaccines" would be included. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Peter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said "it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;HHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of "radical transparency" means being "honest and straightforward about what we know — and what we don't know — about medical products, including vaccines". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone "inert placebo" testing, meaning "we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine," he said. "All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Still, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was "taking a look" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a "void of data". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An HHS spokesperson told the BBC that "significant updates to existing vaccines" may be considered "new products" requiring additional clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years," the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Requiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Before taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This week, he encouraged parents to "do their own research" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a "personal" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 21:36:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9Eb0s0YzFWR1pXRWhERWFYLUFCSWRYWVVvR0J4RXB5NDJycDRDRDdoLWFkaW5UY0VSVnlnd3E2Q0Z5TVhDMWJMal96akpCak5HeURmWVR3ZVFJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nTEtuSHhfV01rOVNkS3NvQ1IwQm9EV0NpWmxXMlR2cXZGVzhFMDBTa0YwNXdkM1hNVmw4LWJ1V0NzLV9SUGIzdHoxNmpyTFhBaW9ZY1RXVHJwQnlLdDdR</guid></item></channel></rss>
