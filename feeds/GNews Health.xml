    &lt;p&gt;Endurance athlete Kevin Humphrey was used to discomfort. He regularly participated in ultramarathons and other intense events. Swimming, biking and running dozens of miles at a time was standard for him. His two young sons also kept him active even when he wasn't training. But in January 2024, a persistent back pain kept bothering him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pain "just would not go away," Humphrey said. He couldn't sleep on his back. At the same time, he started coughing. He was diagnosed with pneumonia, but his symptoms lingered even after treatment. A chest CT scan found "something going on" in his left lung. A biopsy of the organ came back inconclusive, Humphrey said, but he kept pushing for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I knew something was off. It just didn't feel right," Humphrey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey traveled from Michigan to Chicago to seek a second opinion at Northwestern Medicine in May 2024. A bronchoscopy found shocking results: There was a tumor in his lung that was crushing the left side of his windpipe, causing the coughing and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was really in disbelief," said Humphrey, who had never smoked and had no family history of lung cancer. "It wasn't even on my radar as a possibility. It wasn't even an option in my mind."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;"A very concerning and dire situation" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey was diagnosed with Stage IV non-small cell adenocarcinoma, joining the growing number of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/why-do-non-smoking-asian-women-have-high-rates-of-lung-cancer-a-ucsf-study-hopes-to-find-out/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;young, non-smoking patients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diagnosed with lung cancer. The rise may be driven by &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/radon-odorless-colorless-gas-lung-cancer-what-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or lifestyle factors, Dr. Jonathan Villena-Vargas, a thoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lung-cancer-diagnosis-in-non-smoker/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Villena-Vargas, who did not treat Humphrey, said there is no definitive reason for the increase. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further tests found that the cancer had spread beyond Humphrey's lung and had likely been growing for at least a year, Humphrey said. The disease typically has a 37% 5-year survival rate at that point, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6203-non-small-cell-lung-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey's tumor was "pretty advanced" and too large for surgery at first, said Dr. Daniel Dammrich, the Northwestern Medicine oncologist who treated him. But doctors were able to identify a "driver mutation" that was encouraging the cancer's growth. These mutations are more common in young, non-smoking patients, Villena-Vargas said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the mutation "really opened the door for some of our more nuanced, targeted therapies," Dammrich said, and "turned a very concerning and dire situation into a much more optimistic one."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dammrich and Humphrey agreed on an aggressive plan that would combine &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immunotherapy-cancer-mmrd-tumor-memorial-sloan-kettering-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;targeted immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with chemotherapy, in the hopes that the medications would shrink the tumor enough for surgery. Humphrey began immunotherapy immediately, then had chemotherapy in summer 2024. By August, the cancer was operable.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;"The biggest question mark"   &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the cancer meant taking out about half of Humphrey's left lung. The athlete wasn't sure what that would mean for his passion. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You just had no idea. Can you run again, can you bike, can you do all these endurance sports that I've loved doing?" Humphrey said. "That was the biggest question mark going into surgery." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the unknowns, he focused on the future. Michigan's Ironman 70.3 race — which included a 1-mile swim, 56.1-mile bike ride and a 13.2 mile run — was scheduled to take place a year and a day after his surgery. Humphrey decided to sign up, despite his fears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Humphrey had surgery in mid-September. The operation removed most of the cancer, Dammrich said. Recovery was its own battle. Broken ribs and a "pretty big" incision made it difficult for Humphrey to do simple tasks like get out of bed or walk more than a few steps. Running was out of the question for months. But he kept putting one foot in front of the other until his strength and endurance began to slowly return. Even on the hardest days, the upcoming race kept him motivated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a great mental thing to put on the calendar and train for," Humphrey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Across the finish line" &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 14, Humphrey was one of over 1,600 athletes who took part in the Ironman. He finished in just under five and a half hours, coming in &lt;a href="https://www.ironman.com/races/im703-michigan/results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;411th place&lt;/a&gt;. The race was exhausting and emotional, Humphrey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're replaying everything that's happened over the past year and the whirlwind it's been," Humphrey said. "For me, when I got to the point of knowing 'I'm going to finish this race' and thinking about my young boys, my wife, the family and the community and support system we've had throughout the whole year, and how grateful I am to not only be here but to continue to do these types of races and events. I certainly did not think that was going to be the case when I received the diagnosis in May of '24." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Humphrey's medical situation is also positive. He had a complete response to the treatment, and there is currently no evidence of disease in his body, Dammrich said. Regular CT scans and blood tests watch for any new tumor growth. Humphrey remains on immunotherapy with few side effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 12, less than a month after the Ironman, Humphrey ran the Chicago marathon for the sixth time. Over &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/53000-runners-2025-bank-of-america-chicago-marathon/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;53,000 runners participated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the race. Humphrey &lt;a href="https://results.chicagomarathon.com/2025/?content=detail&amp;amp;fpid=search&amp;amp;pid=search&amp;amp;idp=9TGG96382B1FC0&amp;amp;lang=EN_CAP&amp;amp;event=MAR&amp;amp;event_main_group=runner&amp;amp;search%5Bname%5D=Humphrey&amp;amp;search%5Bfirstname%5D=Kevin&amp;amp;search_event=MAR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;placed 25,395th&lt;/a&gt;, finishing in about seven and a half hours. It was "40 or 45 minutes slower" than when he ran the same race in 2023, Humphrey said, but he was proud to have finished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My goal was just to get across the finish line, and that's what we did," Humphrey said. "I was just grateful for the ability to be out there and to run and be doing the things that I've loved doing for such a long time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1700732" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2017 Danish registry analysis&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10030023/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was published online Oct. 30 in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2840506" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/30/fact-checking-viral-claims-that-who-just-listed-the-contraceptive-pill-as-a-carcinogen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;can easily&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.debatemag.com/single-post/omg-the-pill-causes-cancer-here-s-what-tiktok-isn-t-telling-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;be taken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/05/social-media-misinformation-is-scaring-women-about-birth-control/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;out of context&lt;/a&gt; online and be reduced to a single alarming number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2840506" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-survivor-earlier-screening-younger-women-face-rising-cases/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year — about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors Åsa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Fey — interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods — said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. "I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways," she said. "It's really frustrating … especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel — found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea — but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo‑Provera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to interpret the findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer," said Lina S. Mørch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. Mørch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The doctor-patient conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable)," White wrote in an email. "Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, "For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired," referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. "It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data," they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeping the risk in perspective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. Mørch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's "values and preferences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White said it's important to see the big picture. "The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception—so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that both the number of people diagnosed, and the mortality rate increased over the time period. The increase was irrespective of tumour size and stage of the cancer, suggesting that there must be something else at play rather than simply improved diagnosis of extremely small tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In 2017, Kitahara and her team also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2613728" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;examined the medical records&lt;/a&gt; of over 77,000 thyroid cancer patients diagnosed between 1974-2013. The results showed that, while most of the increase in cases was driven by small papillary tumours localised to the thyroid gland, there was also an increase in metastatic papillary cancers that had spread to other parts of the body. While deaths from thyroid cancer are rare, the study also showed these were increasing at a rate of 1.1% per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This suggested that there could be something else that could be driving the increase in these more aggressive tumours," says Kitahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPT2tQWjFnb1BYc21zYWlSd3dCQk1tUG5PTXRHQzBOLXJWWjh4SjdrS2JhUlM3Y0F6c2RZelB3a1FSbmFMallKZlpUNDdrcHRhVlpvTGZjbks5S0czMzJQMGJPbzhLaWdaS0g0X3NJa2R2N0FtYVM0aDY4Q25KYTV2U3BuSldYbGdlWk10VWswLW9zcmxGTjhOQllOY1VBMEhUWEE</guid></item><item><title>埃塞俄比亚报告埃博拉表亲马尔堡首次爆发未接种疫苗疫情--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/11/14/marburg-virus-ethiopia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BULUJMTEDRBSFFF4ZESMJ7SGAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At least nine people in southern Ethiopia have been infected with the deadly Marburg virus, a clinically similar cousin to Ebola, in the East African country’s first outbreak of the highly contagious disease, &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/ethiopia/news/ethiopia-confirms-first-outbreak-marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank"&gt;the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; said Friday.

But sometimes, medicines meant to help us can backfire and harm these vital organs. In India, the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is growing fast: according to a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2825%2901853-7/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, about 138 million Indians are estimated to have CKD in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2018 and 2023, the prevalence among adults rose to approximately 16.4 %, up from about 11.2% a few years ago, as per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39763170/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the NIH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Don’t Ignore Silent Kidney Damage: How to Detect Issues Before It’s Too Late | Dr Sanjeev Bagai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important, not just because kidney disease is common, but because for many people, it's silent until things go badly wrong. Part of the problem is drug-induced damage.

While they ease pain, they also block the production of prostaglandins, molecules that help dilate blood vessels in the kidney, according to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30281062/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study from NIH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.

Once the drug is stopped, kidney function often recovers, but not always completely, especially with higher cumulative doses or long therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: dehydration, existing CKD, liver disease, low albumin, or when used together with other nephrotoxic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: When aminoglycosides are necessary, clinicians often monitor drug levels, adjust dose, ensure good hydration, and avoid other harmful drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vancomycin and other glycopeptides&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vancomycin is a powerful antibiotic often used to treat resistant bacterial infections. But it's not harmless: it has a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4892398/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;known risk of kidney toxicity,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; especially when used at high doses or combined with other nephrotoxins (like aminoglycosides).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism isn’t always simple, sometimes the patient’s illness (for example, sepsis) also contributes, but vancomycin independently increases the risk of acute kidney injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: high trough levels, prolonged therapy, and co-use of other kidney-stressing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Drug dosing needs precision, and kidney function should be monitored closely during therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Radiocontrast agents&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast dyes used in imaging (CT scans, angiography) can sometimes spark contrast-induced nephropathy. These agents can reduce kidney blood flow, generate oxidative stress, and cause direct tubular toxicity. This is especially risky if someone already has &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2043284/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;impaired kidney function or is dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors: diabetes, existing CKD, dehydration, repeated contrast exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Before any diagnostic scan that uses dye, discuss your kidney health. Preventive measures include hydration, using the lowest contrast dose, and possibly alternative imaging strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drugs that affect kidney hemodynamics (ACE Inhibitors / ARBs Combined with Other Risks)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACE inhibitors (like lisinopril) and ARBs (like losartan) are often life-saving drugs for hypertension, heart failure, and kidney disease, but under certain conditions, they can worsen kidney function transiently. These medicines dilate the efferent arteriole (part of the kidney’s blood filter), which lowers glomerular pressure. In most cases, that’s beneficial, but if combined with dehydration, NSAIDs, diuretics, or sudden drop in blood volume, it can contribute to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4975270/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;acute kidney injury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this kind of decline is often reversible, it requires close monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Adding to this Dr Gupta said, "ACE inhibitors and ARBs, such as lisinopril, enalapril, and ramipril, help regulate excessive blood pressure and protect the heart. They too can occasionally cause renal impairment, particularly if you are dehydrated or on other kidney-damaging medications. Diuretics drain excess fluid from the body and are often used to treat high blood pressure and edema. However, if not utilized properly, they can cause dehydration, putting stress on the kidneys and perhaps causing damage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: Never stop these medicines abruptly, but always inform your doctor if you’re vomiting, dehydrated, or taking other high-risk drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we need to know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden risk in “safe” meds: Over-the-counter painkillers (NSAIDs) are often underestimated. People think they’re harmless, but over time and especially in vulnerable individuals, they can quietly erode kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy of harm: It’s not just one drug, the real damage often happens when multiple “almost safe” medicines interact (for example, NSAIDs + ACE inhibitors + diuretics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person on painkillers long-term may not even realise their kidneys are being stressed, because the early signs are subtle. Empowering patients with knowledge (especially in India, where self-medication is common) could prevent a lot of silent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for educational purposes only and does not replace medical advice.

More than &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/high-blood-pressure-understanding-silent-killer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;119 million US adults have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, according to the US Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration’s 2024 data. However, only one in four of those people has their condition under control. While many assume hypertension is harmless, the truth is far from it. A groundbreaking study has now found that hypertension damages the brain even before the fluctuations show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research from Weill Cornell Medicine found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00799-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;hypertension damages the brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; days before blood pressure increases. These findings could reshape how doctors treat the condition. The preclinical findings are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Neuron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hypertension affects the brain much earlier than expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new preclinical study by Weill Cornell Medicine investigators found that hypertension impairs blood vessels, neurons, and white matter in the brain even before the condition causes a measurable rise in blood pressure. These findings help explain why hypertension is a major risk factor for developing cognitive disorders, such as vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. The study also found that the condition may induce early gene expression changes in individual brain cells that could interfere with thinking and memory. These findings could pave the way for medications that both reduce blood pressure and prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though people with hypertension have a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.039849" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1.2- to 1.5-fold higher risk of developing cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; than others, the reason behind this wasn’t known. While many medications successfully lower high blood pressure, they have little or no effect on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the major cells responsible for cognitive impairment were affected just three days after inducing hypertension in mice—before blood pressure increased. The bottom line is that something beyond the dysregulation of blood pressure is involved,” senior author Dr Costantino Iadecola, director of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, professor of neuroscience and Anne Parrish Titzell Professor of Neurology at Weill Cornell, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early cellular damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, co-led by postdoctoral associate Dr Anthony Pacholko, used advanced single-cell technology to examine how hypertension affects different brain cell types at the molecular level. The researchers induced hypertension in mice using angiotensin, a hormone that raises blood pressure in humans. On the third day, they analysed the brain cells—this was even before blood pressure increased. When they checked again on day 42, the blood pressure was elevated and cognitive function had declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At day three, gene expression changed dramatically in endothelial cells lining blood vessels, interneurons regulating nerve signals, and oligodendrocytes that maintain myelin sheaths around nerve fibres. They also noticed premature ageing in endothelial cells, with reduced energy metabolism and higher senescence markers. They observed early signs of a weakened blood–brain barrier, which potentially allows harmful molecules into the brain while restricting nutrients. They also observed changes similar to patterns seen in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The extent of the early alterations induced by hypertension was quite surprising. Understanding how hypertension affects the brain at the cellular and molecular levels during the earliest stages of the disease may provide clues to finding ways that can potentially block neurodegeneration,” Dr Pacholko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent brain damage from hypertension &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested losartan, an antihypertensive drug that inhibits angiotensin receptors. They found that the medication reversed early hypertension effects on endothelial cells and interneurons in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In some human studies, the data suggest that angiotensin receptor inhibitors may be more beneficial to cognitive health than other drugs that lower blood pressure,” Dr Iadecola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hypertension is a leading cause of damage to the heart and the kidneys, which can be prevented by antihypertensive drugs. So, independent of cognitive function, treating high blood pressure is a priority,” Dr Iadecola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

AKI can occur after major stressors such as sepsis or heart surgery, and more than half of all intensive care patients experience it. No approved medications currently exist to treat this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at University of Utah Health (U of U Health) have discovered that fatty molecules called ceramides initiate AKI by damaging the mitochondria that supply energy to kidney cells. By using a backup drug candidate designed to alter how ceramides are processed, the team protected mitochondrial structure and prevented kidney injury in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We completely reversed the pathology of acute kidney injury by inactivating ceramides," says Scott Summers, PhD, distinguished professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and senior author on the study. "We were stunned -- not only did kidney function stay normal, but the mitochondria were unscathed," Summers says. "It was truly remarkable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceramide spikes may serve as an early warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies from the Summers lab showed that ceramides can harm organs such as the heart and liver. When the researchers measured ceramides in AKI models, they found a strong connection: levels rose sharply after injury in both mice and in human urine samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ceramide levels are very elevated in kidney injury," says Rebekah Nicholson, PhD, first author on the work, who completed the research as a graduate student in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Arc Institute. "They go up quickly after damage to the kidneys, and they go up in relation to the severity of the injury. The worse the kidney injury is, the higher the ceramide levels will be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that urinary ceramides could act as an early biomarker for AKI, giving clinicians a tool to identify vulnerable patients, including those preparing for heart surgery, before symptoms begin. "If patients are undergoing a procedure that we know puts them at high risk of AKI, then we can better predict whether or not they're actually going to have one," Nicholson says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altering ceramide production protects kidney function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team nearly eliminated kidney injury in a mouse model by modifying the genetic program that controls ceramide production. This change produced "super mice" that did not develop AKI even under conditions that typically cause severe damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested a ceramide-lowering drug candidate created by Centaurus Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Summers. Mice treated ahead of time avoided kidney injury, maintained normal kidney function, remained active, and had kidneys that appeared close to normal under the microscope. Nicholson notes that their model places extreme stress on the kidneys, making it "really remarkable that mice were protected from the injury."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These mice looked incredible," Summers adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that ceramides harm mitochondria, the parts of the cell responsible for energy production. Damaged mitochondria in kidney cells become distorted and function poorly. Adjusting ceramide production, whether genetically or with the drug, kept mitochondria intact and working even under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for future therapies targeting mitochondrial health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summers explains that the compound used in this study is closely related to, but not identical to, the ceramide-lowering drug that has entered human clinical testing. He emphasizes that mouse results do not always predict human outcomes and that further research is needed to confirm safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're thrilled by how protective this backup compound was, but it's still preclinical," Summers says. "We need to be cautious and do our due diligence to make sure this approach is truly safe before moving it into patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the researchers are encouraged by the findings. If the results extend to people, the drug could potentially be administered ahead of time to individuals who face a high risk of AKI, including patients undergoing heart surgery, where about one quarter experience the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the drug appears to work by maintaining mitochondrial health, the team believes that the approach may have relevance for other disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mitochondrial problems show up in so many diseases -- heart failure, diabetes, fatty liver disease," Summers says. "So if we can truly restore mitochondrial health, the implications could be enormous."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are published in Cell Metabolism as "Therapeutic Remodeling of the Ceramide Backbone Prevents Kidney Injury."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you toss your microfiber towels in the wash with clothes or &lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/how-to-wash-towels-8667565" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other towels&lt;/a&gt;, it's important to know the proper process for cleaning these essentials to keep the fibers intact. We spoke to several cleaning experts for their professional tips on how to wash microfiber towels the right way to keep from ruining them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cleaning your microfiber towels, there are two ways you can go about this: a simple toss in the washing machine or washing by hand. We've broken down the two process step by step so you know how to use both options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--OL"&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Separate Microfiber Towels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may seem smart to wash your microfiber towels with other bath linens and bedding sheets to knock them all out at once, but microfiber towels need to be washed in their own load.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of the fiber material, microfiber towels are notorious for attracting lint that can come from other materials in the wash.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Add In a Gentle Cleaner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before running your cycle, you'll want to add in a gentle cleaner to remove dirt, grime, and residue from your microfiber towels. "Many commercial (grocery store) detergents contain harsh chemicals that degrade the towel fibers," says Ceconi. "We recommend using a gentle detergent that's concentrated, pH-neutral to protect fabric and skin, and cleans with natural detergent enzymes."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you need to be more cautious about what's in your microfiber towel load and the cleaner you use, know that it's okay to run a normal setting for the actual wash. Ceconi recommends selecting a lukewarm setting for the wash to preserve your fibers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceconi says it's extremely important to never wash your microfiber towels with chlorine bleach or fabric softener. He says chlorine bleach will damage and face your towels, while fabric softener doesn't soften your towels at all. "The truth is that fabric softeners don't soften fabric. Instead, they deposit a waxy coating over the fibers that damages your towels absorbency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To wash your microfiber towels, Cohoon says you will need a bucket or sink that is filled with warm water mixed with a few drops of gentle dish soap. "Avoid fabric softeners and bleach, as they can coat or break down the fibers," she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-startgroup mntl-sc-block-group--LI"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Soak &amp;amp; Agitate the Towels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next you will need to soak your towels in the solution for 10-15 minutes. Once the time is up, Cohoon says to gently rub them together with your hands to clean off the dirt, grime, and residue from your towels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After you've washed all your towels, drain your soapy water and then rinse each towel completely under running water until the soap suds are completely gone. Then, ring out the excess water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-drying-dos-and-donts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block southernliving-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Drying Dos And Don'ts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like washing your microfiber towels, you have two drying options: tossing in the drying machine or air drying. "Air drying is best for microfiber towels," Cohoon says. "All you need to do is hang each towel until they're fully dry, but them out of direct heat."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have limited space or want your towels to dry faster, it is possible to run them through a drying cycle, but of course there are a few precautions. "Microfiber towels should be dried on as low a heat as possible to preserve the integrity of the fibers and the durability of the bindings/finishes on the towels," says Ceconi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if you choose this method, there's one product Ceconi says you should never add to the dryer with your microfiber towels. "Also, as I mentioned above with fabric softener, never use dryer sheets. These work in essentially the same way as liquid fabric softener by depositing a waxy coating on your towels that will ruin their feel, look, and performance over time."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once your microfiber towels are clean, you'll want to store them properly so their fibers stay strong and effective. Here are a few storage tips to keep your microfiber towels in prime working condition:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Store in a cool, dry place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your towels in a ziplock bag to prevent moisture from building up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never put your towels in a humid or high-heat environment to prevent mold and mildew.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't store microfiber towels with other linens to prevent the transfer of lint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like most things around the house, you'll need to &lt;a href="https://www.southernliving.com/home/cleaning-and-housekeeping/when-to-get-new-towels" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;replace your microfiber towels&lt;/a&gt; after an extended period of time. Once your microfiber towels begin to lose their softness or functionality, especially with water absorption, it's time for a fresh set. You'll also know it's time to swap out your microfiber towels when they begin to fray or pull apart.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it's better to wash microfiber towels alone. If washed with other items, lint can transfer to them and be difficult to remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="2"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use lukewarm water to wash microfiber towels. This keeps the fibers intact while killing bacteria, without risking shrinking or damage from too much heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can use vinegar and baking soda to wash microfiber towels. They help remove odors and buildup naturally. Just be sure to avoid fabric softeners or harsh commercial products that can harm the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="4"&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate odors from microfiber towels, add vinegar and baking soda to your wash. They effectively break down smells for fresh, clean towels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal="5"&gt;

The older adult with underlying health conditions remains hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-h5n1-poultry-human-case-5732c6be85f45c9f61a11a7aa2f0eef3"&gt;had announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the preliminary bird flu diagnosis on Thursday. On Friday, they said it had been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person was infected with a bird flu called H5N5, state officials said. State and federal health officials said it appears to be the first known human infection with the H5N5 bird flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That version is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“These viruses behave similarly,” said Richard Webby, a prominent flu researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. “My gut instinct is to consider it the same as H5N1 from a human health perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued a similar statement that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency is awaiting a specimen from Washington to conduct additional testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Think along the lines of different brands of car tires. They both do the same job, it’s just each is better tuned for specific conditions, which we don’t fully understand,” Webby wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N5 may have a different preference for which kind of birds it most readily infects, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grays Harbor County resident, who has not been identified, has a backyard flock of domestic poultry that had been exposed to wild birds, health officials said. They believe the domestic poultry or wild birds are the most likely source of exposure, but say they are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

                &lt;p&gt;Scientists are sounding the alarm: this winter’s upcoming flu season in North America could be a real nightmare, thanks to the rapid arrival of a variant that doesn’t match well with the seasonal flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Canada issued the warning in a paper late last month. An unexpected variant of the H3N2 flu, dubbed subclade K, quickly emerged during the tail end of the flu season in the Southern Hemisphere this year, they noted. Subclade K is now poised to become one of the most dominant variants of the flu season in the U.S. and Canada, and it’s likely that our vaccines will be less effective overall this winter against the flu than experts had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While mismatched vaccines can still provide protection against circulating variants, enhanced surveillance is warranted,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A drifting mismatch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the peak of a flu season, multiple variants of influenza A and influenza B viruses will spread between people.  Because it takes about nine months to ramp up enough vaccines for everyone in a given hemisphere, scientists and health authorities meet twice a year (once for the northern half, once for the southern) to predict which variants are most likely to circulate in the population, and thus, which variants a seasonal flu vaccine should cover. Part of this educated guesswork comes from tracking the flu strains moving across the globe at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Usually, the predictions aren’t too far off, and the vaccines will provide at least moderate protection from illness. But flu viruses are always evolving, and variants can gradually develop mutations (a process called drift) that make them significantly different from what scientists had expected them to look like. That seems to be what’s happened here with the latest versions of H3N2, a type of influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, an increasing amount of H3N2 variants with concerning mutations emerged during last winter’s flu season in the northern hemisphere. These variants are perhaps one major reason why the U.S. experienced such a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/flu-cases-are-surging-heres-why-this-season-is-so-unusual-2000561630"&gt;hard-hitting flu&lt;/a&gt; this past winter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More recently, a further drifted and poorly matched lineage of H3N2—subclade K—emerged toward the end of the winter in the Southern Hemisphere. This lineage is now “projected to predominate among A(H3N2) viruses for the NH 2025–2026 season,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The possibility remains that subclade K will not spread widely in North America, since there will be other circulating variants of flu around at the same time. But the odds of that aren’t looking too good. In the UK, health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;already announced&lt;/a&gt; an early start to its flu season, with a majority of these cases being caused by subclade K. Hospitals in the region are now preparing for a big surge of flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth wondering whether the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/irreparably-damaged-former-senior-official-details-the-darkest-days-of-the-cdc-under-rfk-jr-2000673201"&gt;fractured state of public health&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. will further hamper efforts to contain the flu. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have overseen dramatic funding cuts and layoffs throughout the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health agencies this year, while RFK Jr. has fired or pressured senior health officials to leave the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why vaccines still matter&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the dire outlook, vaccines remain one of the most important tools against the flu this season. There are other strains of flu that the vaccine will cover, and a mismatched vaccine can still provide some protection against the worst outcomes of flu, which can include death. Thankfully, there is good news on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This week, the UK Health Security Agency &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;the latest data from its flu surveillance program. Even with a mismatched variant in the picture, the vaccine is currently estimated to be 70% to 75% effective at preventing flu hospitalizations in children and 30% to 40% effective in adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These results provide reassuring evidence that this season’s flu vaccines currently offer important protection to children and adults, despite concerns about the new subclade,” said Jamie Lopez Bernal, consultant epidemiologist for Immunization at UKHSA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So it’s still worthwhile to get your flu shot as soon as you can. But given the mismatch this winter, it’s all the more important to practice good hygiene, to stay home if you’re sick, and to potentially wear a mask in higher-risk situations for added protection (well-fitting, high-quality masks such as a KN95 or N95 being the most effective).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 21:10:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPbzJ3V0kweWo3b2JrNmk0QTY5M2hHWThzV1h3Zk9aRUVEQjZjZElpYUZ3d1Z6MlpDNm0wWXl0Y3V4RHJvUVlyYkl4RzI4SGhPQmdUcFdoejZWX3VCOVVDcHJCZUt6MVRrakUwMGdEb2NxbXRZQi11NkpqR1FqMXdYblRPeXdzbldMa1JZcXg5OThDemkxTXA2RmNtNzhjd2Z6Rkdpam9pNnY</guid></item><item><title>随着关闭的结束，可疑的CDC小组重新开始拆除疫苗接种计划- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/as-shutdown-ends-dubious-cdc-panel-gets-back-to-dismantling-vaccine-schedule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Kennedy’s ACIP members planned to push the first dose back a month. A vote was prepared to recommend &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;giving a birth dose unless there was “individual based decision-making.” While at first the panel seemed poised to vote in favor of the change, the plan collapsed with basic questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting ACIP member Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist, noted: “I’m unclear if we’ve been presented with any safety or data comparing before one month to after one month,” he said. They had not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And,” Hibbeln continued, “I’m wondering why one month was selected as our time point and if there are data to help to inform us if there’s greater risk of adverse effects before one month or after one month at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no data suggesting that such a move would be more or less safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion quickly spiraled from there with an eventual vote of 11-1 to table voting on the vaccine recommendation. According to the Federal Register notice, ACIP will try to take up the topic again. They could revive the vote or attack some other aspect of vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pediatricians fight back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts have blasted Kennedy’s lineup and their attacks on childhood vaccines, including the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. The current schedule “remains the best protection against serious health problems like liver disease and cancer,” the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasized to Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ACIP’s standing tarnished under Kennedy, AAP has put forth its own evidence-based vaccine schedule for pediatricians to trust. They’ve also been a prominent opponent among medical organizations to Kennedy’s efforts. For instance, in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.286605/gov.uscourts.mad.286605.139.0.pdf"&gt;a revised federal lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, the AAP along with other medical organizations is seeking to overturn all decisions made by Kennedy’s ACIP and replace the entire panel with actual experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s appointees “lack the credentials and experience required of their role,” and all their votes should be declared “null and void,” the organization said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAP President Susan Kressly &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33682/Updated-AAP-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-ACIP-members"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that pediatricians are already seeing the effects of having an anti-vaccine activist as the US health secretary, namely “fear, decreased vaccine confidence, and barriers for families to access vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The nation’s children are already paying the price in avoidable illnesses and hospitalizations,” Kressly said. “We urge federal leaders to restore the science-based deliberative process that has made the United States a global leader in public health. Urgent action is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

The participants viewed 2,180 videos without sound that were seconds long and varied in content among objects, scenes and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large language models — generative AI systems trained on large datasets — took captions of the video clips and turned those captions into sequences of numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horikawa trained separate, simpler AI models, known as "decoders," to match the scanned brain activity related to the video clips to the numerical sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then used the decoders to interpret the study participants' brain activity while they watched or recalled videos that the AI had not encountered during the training process. Another algorithm was created to progressively generate word sequences that best matched the decoded brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the AI learned from the data, the descriptive text tool became better and better at using the brain scans to describe the videos the participants had watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's just one additional step forward in the direction of what, in my view, we can legitimately call brain-reading or mind-reading," Marcello Ienca, a professor of the ethics of AI and neuroscience at Technical University of Munich in Germany and president-elect of the International Neuroethics Society, told CNN. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential for 'profound' health interventions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI model generated text in English, even though the participants were not native English speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method can create comprehensive descriptions of visual content, even without using the activity in language-related regions of the brain, or the "language network," Horikawa said, "indicating that this method can be used even when someone has damage around that language network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology could potentially be used to assist people with aphasia, who struggle with language expression due to damage around the language network; or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects speech, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this study paves the way for some profound interventions for people who have difficulty communicating, including nonverbal autistic people," said psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, a lecturer at Barnard College in New York who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "we have to use it carefully and make sure we aren't being invasive and that everyone consents to it," he told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'The ultimate privacy challenge'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of this method — which could be applied to decode the thoughts of infants or animals, or the content of dreams — "raises ethical concerns" regarding privacy, with the possibility of disclosing an individual's private thoughts before they have verbalized them, the study noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If in the future this technology is used by consumers beyond biomedical purposes, "I think this is the ultimate privacy challenge," Ienca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there are many companies, such as Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain implant startup, that are making public claims about soon developing neural implants for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we get there, then we need to have very, very strict rules when it comes to granting access to people's minds and brains," Ienca said, highlighting that our brains include "sensitive information" such as "signatures of early dementia and psychiatric disorders and depression."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal Cell in August suggested that the "leakage" of private inner thoughts during decoding could be prevented by a mechanism in which the user thinks of a particular keyword to unlock the decoding tool only when intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "neuroscience is moving fast and the assistive potential is huge — but mental privacy and freedom of thought protections can't wait," said social scientist Łukasz Szoszkiewicz, an assistant professor at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland and a director of European Affairs at the Neurorights Foundation in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should treat neural data as sensitive by default, require explicit purpose-limited consent, and prioritize on-device processing with user-controlled 'unlock' mechanisms. Reliance on AI introduces additional regulatory and cybersecurity challenges and underscores the need for complementary, AI-specific legal framework," Szoszkiewicz, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Horikawa noted that the method used in his study requires a large amount of data collection, with the cooperation of active participants. So, while the technology is useful for neuroscientific research, it is "not so accurate for practical use," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the videos used in the study included typical scenes of, for example, a dog biting a man, but not more unusual scenes — say, a man biting a dog. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the technique could be used to capture less predictable mental images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, "while some people may worry that this technology poses serious risk to mental privacy," in reality, "the current approach cannot easily read a person's private thoughts," Horikawa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Because of this, officials advise anyone who was at the Taylorsville InstaCare during that time period to check their MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If people have received one or two doses of the MMR vaccine, they are considered immune, according to the health department. After receiving two vaccines, officials say people are protected from measles infections 97% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The measles case in Salt Lake City is the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;77th confirmed in Utah this year&lt;/a&gt;, and the 13th confirmed in the state within the last three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In late October, Salt Lake County health officials believed a different person was infected, but said that person refused to be tested or take part in an investigation. Without those results, officials said they could not confirm the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;That unconfirmed case is not related to the case confirmed this week, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Throughout the United States, health officials have confirmed 1,700 cases confirmed by 42 states, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The national outbreak comes as fewer kindergartners are receiving the MMR vaccine, the CDC has reported. If more than 95% of a community is vaccinated, the CDC says they can achieve “herd immunity.” However, the agency reports, kindergartners’ vaccination rates nationwide dropped from 95.2% in the 2019-20 school year to 92.7% in 2023-24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Numbers stray even further from herd immunity in Utah, where the CDC estimates only 88.8% of kindergartners were adequately vaccinated against measles during the 2023-24 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 20:23:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE4wdkNrTGVHbjRYTzUyR0l5aWlNLWdiRkJjdjRJNC1uWVFiMTdYeFRVOVlTOThsZ3JjOGRrNTlnb0hyR0RhdXJKNGRURFhmeU41MTl2c094V0tFcEd6WjlucDlSMk9BN0pXXzlpTmx2dU1PckM0OW16TE5n</guid></item><item><title>盐湖县在全国范围内确认首例麻疹病例- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51405526/salt-lake-county-confirms-its-first-case-of-measles-amid-nationwide-outbreak</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — The Salt Lake County Health Department on Friday confirmed a measles infection in an adult resident — the first lab-confirmed case identified in the county amid a current nationwide outbreak of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infected individual is unvaccinated, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case is especially concerning because the source of the patient's infection is unknown," Dorothy Adams, executive director of the department, said in a statement. "They have not knowingly had contact with anyone who had measles, which means their infection is the result of transmission somewhere out in the community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department said epidemiologists are working quickly to notify anyone the patient may have exposed and all personal contacts of the infected individual have already been notified individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, health officials say the patient visited one public location while they were infectious and people who were at the following location during the indicated date and times may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taylorsville InstaCare, 3845 W. 4700 South, on Friday, Nov. 7, from 3 p.m. to 7:15 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials in October &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51397304/salt-lake-county-identifies-its-first-probable-case-of-measles-amid-nationwide-outbreak" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; what they believed was the first case of measles reported in the county, but they were unable to confirm the diagnosis because the patient declined to participate in their investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient has declined to be tested or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact," Adams said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread to as many as nine out of 10 unprotected people who are near an infected person, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; County officials say two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are the best way to prevent infection and limit the severity of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but cases this year have spiked nationwide to the highest level since then. Utah has reported 77 confirmed cases this year, the majority in southwest Utah, according to the state's Measles Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms typically manifest seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose and red or watery eyes, according to the department. Patients with measles typically have tiny white spots appear inside their mouth two to three days after symptoms begin and get a rash within three to five days of the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will need hospitalization, according to the department, with young children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who suspect they may have been exposed to measles are asked to contact their health care provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Instead, it says that “treatment is limited to supportive care”, including rest and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Ethiopia was reported in the country’s southern region of Omo, which borders South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya said on Thursday that the outbreak was a concern because “&lt;a href="/where/south-sudan/"&gt;South Sudan&lt;/a&gt; isn’t far and has a fragile health system”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other African country has reported Marburg virus cases in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tedros, the WHO chief, said on Friday that the UN agency was “actively supporting Ethiopia to contain the outbreak and treat infected people, and supporting all efforts to address the potential of cross-border spread”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian Ministry of Health also said that community-wide screenings were being conducted in relation to the outbreak, alongside efforts to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people have been isolated and are being treated, it said in a statement shared on social media, while work to identify anyone who may have come into contact with suspected cases was also under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry urged people not to panic, to follow instructions from the health authorities, and to seek medical care if they exhibit any signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:56:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOTU96Yk5nRHgwU0VmdlowU0d1ekdjV0lQdUdpc1phQ0tJaTdrelVXckRlR0NlRGNKd0tLR3VsLU9nbkJMYmtZVGlyOGxSZGctQ1k0VDNYUzZqYkx6NFZxcTFyeFV6dDZ4TlRzRTBBQVdZVnNMRmdnMlBfRk9aZ2ZpSXhxajZTcFdWcWJRb2tEcm05OWFDdGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMUFV2eXBTcW5ZYkdFcnE3cUxmRTdSZjhRX3dGVENJMjhmZUNiR3EzYXMzOGowMDZjTzVnWkdCRDVMQ1BLYUg0Skc2aUt6dGJDV01DRVhPWmlud1lWVzUxVHJMdUtURkh1cHpPNTZ1S1ZfVnpsVWQtNUd3WlpPMHhtYXNkV2NLUG5jdGF4Tld1d2VuYmt5bG8zblNBVTQ</guid></item><item><title>9个月内首例美国人类禽流感病例确诊，以前仅在动物身上见过- abcnews.go.com</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/suspected-human-bird-flu-case-1st-us-9/story?id=127519769</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A Washington state resident has tested positive for bird flu, marking the first human case confirmed in the U.S. in nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The patient, who is an older adult with underlying health conditions, developed symptoms including high fever, confusion and respiratory distress and was hospitalized in early November, according to the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Testing confirmed the patient has H5N5, a strain of bird flu that has previously been reported in animals but never before in humans, according to the Washington State Department of Health.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="194" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw000vphkwiotsjdm5@published"&gt;My 67-year-old dad has been sick with a rare cancer since 2017. Without going too much into the saga of his surgeries/treatments, it’s been a battle with many ups and downs. Up until more recently, he was managing well and able to do most of the activities that he loves to do, including spending time with his grandchildren. He has become very thin and weaker than ever before, with frequent exhaustion that requires a lot of rest. There are no more treatment options, and it’s unclear what the management looks like from here. There is no formal prognosis, but I fear that the rate things are going he does not have a lot of time left. My mom, who has been his caretaker, is also exhausted and emotionally drained from this. My question revolves around talking about this with my son, “Freddie.” Freddie just turned 4, and because my dad has mostly been able to do regular things with us when we visit (we live four hours away by car), I’ve never actually told him that his grandpa is sick. It seemed way too complicated to discuss with him, especially before he was 4.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz7nms200113b78qrc88l86@published"&gt;How do you prepare a young child for the passing of their grandparent? Do I even discuss it with him yet? We have not really had an official conversation about death before, outside of seeing roadkill or a bug being squished. We haven’t talked about dying in regards to people. I don’t want to talk about it too soon, because I know it would take away from the time that he does spend with my dad, not to mention make my dad feel uncomfortable or sad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zt6v000b3b78o7di9egd@published"&gt;But would waiting make it more difficult? Freddie is very social with great language skills and a mind like a steel trap, and I know if I were to discuss something with him, he’d likely talk about it with or in front of grandma/grandpa. I’m also trying to emotionally prepare myself for losing my dad, something that seemed like a death sentence almost 10 years ago, and it feels incredibly heavy and weighs on my mind a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zthq000e3b780qvxa2t4@published"&gt;You’re doing such a good job, and you should continue to follow your gut here. I think it’s been the right move to avoid talking about your dad’s illness with your son, and I think you should put it off as long as you can. What a gift, in a time of pain and anxiety, to have a child who is oblivious to it. Give your dad and yourself (and your son!) this gift as long as it keeps making sense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztju000f3b7830m15q4e@published"&gt;It’s likely that pretty soon, Freddie will notice that something is different, and there will be something material that you can talk about with him. For example, if your dad follows the usual trajectory of a person with untreatable cancer, his energy will continue to decrease. He’ll stop leaving the house, then stop leaving his bed. Whether you and Freddie are doing video calls or in-person visits, these are things that your son will notice, and you can talk to him about it. Keep your explanations simple and straight-forward. So you might say, “We’re going to visit grandpa, and he’s going to be in his bed because he’s very sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztmu000g3b789dhc4ie0@published"&gt;You don’t need to tell Freddie that granddad is dying—wait to tell him about death until your dad has died. I know you’re worried about “preparing” him, but as you’re finding, even adults can’t really “prepare” ourselves for the death of our loved ones. Even once your dad goes on hospice, it could be weeks or months before he dies—everyone’s timeline is their own. That uncertainty is going to be hard enough for you; protect your son from it, if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6ztoa000h3b786m0c5kxa@published"&gt;When your dad does die, use simple language to tell your son, something like: “Grandpa died, it means we can’t see him or talk to him anymore, but we can talk about him and look at pictures and know that he loved us very much.” And it’s OK to be sad about it with him! He’ll have a lot of questions, and again, just be a straightforward and honest as possible. And it’s OK to say, “I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz752sd000p3b78udugvyzb@published"&gt;It can really help  to read about how other people have handled these conversations, because you’ll see that there is no “one right way.” You might also find language that resonates with you. This &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1fwsnju/please_help_me_explain_death_to_my_4_year_old_one/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; has some really thoughtful responses.

And of course, our columnists have written on this topic in the past: &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/talk-children-death-advice.html"&gt;Allison Price&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/01/funerals-grief-education-opportunity-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;Nicole Cliffe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/05/parenting-advice-for-a-grandpa-who-must-explain-death-to-his-grandson-and-a-mom-who-doesnt-want-to-deliver-a-hat.html"&gt;Carvell Wallace&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2018/07/parenting-advice-how-to-handle-end-of-life-care-with-kids-in-the-house.html"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;).

In the mornings, I have to literally dress him and get him to the car ASAP when we leave for his daycare, because if I leave him unattended for so much as a minute, everything comes off and I have to start all over. His daycare has had some success in keeping him clothed, but if they don’t watch him carefully he’ll soon be wearing his birthday suit. It’s getting to the point where they have said he will not be able to come back if the problem isn’t resolved. My husband thinks that since the weather is getting colder, the solution is to let him go outside without his clothes on so he can “learn what they’re for.” I’m not willing to risk him getting hypothermia just to prove a point. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

We don’t &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;wear clothes to keep us warm in the cold. We wear them because, in our society, it’s an universal rule, in public and in many private businesses (like daycares!), that we wear clothes that cover our bodies. Also: Many kids feel temperature differently, and it’s entirely possible your son could go out in the cold naked and be perfectly comfortable and undeterred in the least. He might also get hypothermia, so like, let’s just nip that one in the bud.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz89prq00193b78vol1slit@published"&gt;You’re on a daycare deadline, so Instead of trying to make a behavior change, I think you’ve got to make a clothes change and dress him in clothes that he can’t take off—the most common suggestion I’ve seen for this is one-piece pajamas worn backwards, so the zips or snaps are in the back. And while you’re at it, I’d make sure the ones you’re picking are soft, breathable, and don’t have tags inside in case he’s stripping because his clothes are uncomfortable. (Often, brands label these as “sensory friendly.”) You might have to try several options, but hopefully you can get one that he’ll tolerate (I expect that he’ll try to take anything off at first, but will soon move on.) I think this will be a blip. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhz6zkjw0015phkwtywk3c3y@published"&gt;Is there such a thing as taking too many pictures of your kids? My husband, who is a great father, is really fanatical about taking photos of our only child, a 3-year-old girl. He takes pictures of her CONSTANTLY. He thinks it’s important to document every day, so he’ll take a minimum of 10 photos daily, along with a few short videos. That’s just on an average day. If anything remotely interesting happens—a new toy, an outing, a new skill—he’ll take dozens of photos and 10–20 minutes of video. He has videos of her &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/childhood-photos-too-many-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;singing every song she knows, every word she tries to say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At her largest she hit 230lbs, classifying her as morbidly obese for her 5ft 2in frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came her moment of humiliation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was explaining to an overweight patient how he could lower his blood pressure naturally by slimming down,when he snapped back: 'Well, you go first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was kind of snickering at me,' Dr Booth &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-3fb08090-c17d-11f0-8556-6fe7e2457a06"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And these awkward encounters became more frequent, with patients pointing out Dr Booth's hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Brittany Booth, pictured left at 320lbs and right today, lost half her body weight over two years after following a diet plan that saw her consume virtually no carbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many overweight people, she had tried every fad diet under the sun, but had always abandoned efforts after being disappointed by slow progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It didn't help that she was prone to comfort eating, often consuming half a tub of ice cream a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the embarrassing encounters with her patients gave her a new determination to shed the weight and she made herself a promise - in August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I decided I didn't care how long it took or how slow the progress was, I was determined to get healthy again,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What followed was a two-year struggle that eventually saw her lose a total of 120lbs - at a pace of about 1lb a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine years on, and now 41, Dr Booth &lt;span&gt;has succeeded in keeping the fat off and today weighs around 110lbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And she has done it all without the use of weight-loss drugs - instead changing her diet and introducing moderate exercise into her routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She began by sifting through online diet plans and quickly noted a striking trend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She learned that &lt;/span&gt;America's obesity problem had begun in the early 1980s, around the time US dietary guidelines promoting a low-fat, high-carb diet were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back then, around 15 percent of Americans were obese, estimates suggest, compared to more than 40 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say few people actually followed the 'low-fat, high-carb' advice, but the guidelines prompted food companies to reformulate their products, cutting fat and adding sugar or refined carbs to make foods taste better and appear 'healthier'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We now know, however, that carbs &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4742721/#:~:text=Abstract,fat%20may%20contain%20more%20sugar."&gt;lead to weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, not fats - though many fad diets have not kept pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Dr Booth decided to flip the script and switched to her own low-carb, high-fat plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She largely focused on healthy, unsaturated fats found in olive oil, fatty fish and, at lower levels, in beef and pork. Doctors now say these can help to improve cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth followed a plan where she ate no carbs for six out of seven days of the week, only meat and vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She did not count her calories and still ate three meals a day, filling her plate with greens and ensuring every meal contained a fist-sized portion of meat for protein - including bacon, chicken, pork and even burgers without the bun&lt;span&gt;. For snacks, she had nuts or cheese. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also gave up those daily ice cream binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth also started to incorporate more exercise into her day, steering clear of running or weightlifting, but using other strategies such as parking further away from the office to walk more and talking the stairs instead of the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Booth started her weight loss journey in August 2014 after she noticed some patients snickering at her. She has managed to keep the weight off for nine years after reaching her goal weight in August 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight loss was slow compared to those on weight-loss drugs, and there were some weeks where she did not lose any weight or even gained a few pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to her 1lb-per-week loss, people who turn to Ozempic, Wegovy or similar drugs, typically lose around double the amount of weight every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, she was also juggling work and caring for her children - and because her kids were fussy eaters, she had to make two meals every night, one for herself and another for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, back in 2014, Ozempic was not available when Dr Booth started losing weight. Now, she says, she would definitely have used it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that by not resorting to weight-loss drugs she was able to built habits that have allowed her to both lose weight and keep it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only about 20 percent of people who come off weight-loss drugs manage to maintain their slimmer frame, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13006179/ozempic-wegovy-patients-weight-stopping-drugs.html"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly one in five regain all the weight they have lost and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors say this is likely because they did not also build the healthy habits that would help them to maintain the weight loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think I am happy with the way I lost the weight because it shows that you do it on your own. I think it gives me a little more credibility even,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have this standard now, right now with GLP-1s, where you can lose like ten pounds a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But rapid weight loss is not healthy in general, because it can lead to other medical problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Booth said her weight rose, in part, because she would binge eat ice cream and would use it both as a reward and to relieve stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your body is like an equilibrium, and when you are shifting fat cells and fluids and all of the other components of weight loss, your body has to readjust,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're losing massive amounts of weight too quickly, it can be really dangerous. And then, there is, of course, the cosmetic side of it. You're going to get saggy skin, you're going to get wrinkles. It doesn't look good when you lose weight too quickly. And, also, you lose a lot of muscle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that rapid weight loss involving a very restrictive diet can also lead to nutrient deficiency, muscle loss, fatigue, loose skin and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Booth said she was '100 percent certain' that the slow weight loss allowed her skin to retract much better than in many Ozempic patients, although she still needed to have some surgery to remove the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally lost a whole person. So, I did have some extra skin around my tummy and some extra skin around my arms, and I did have that removed, although it wasn't really necessary; it was purely cosmetic,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reaching her goal weight, Dr Booth went on to build her own weight-loss clinic, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bodybybarker.com/#"&gt;Body by Barker&lt;/a&gt;, in York, Pennsylvania. Dr Booth's middle name is Barker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, people take my advice more seriously now, and specifically when I am coaching on weight,' she said. 'They consider me something of an expert because I have done it all myself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet, libraries and bookshops are full of plans and advice on how to lose weight, from fad diets to intense exercise routines. But there could be another route to keeping the pounds away, and that's with a gut bacterium called Turicibacter.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, around 1 in 8 people are living with obesity. This global crisis can cause significant health complications and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. For years, scientists have known that our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-gut-microbiome-brain-bodies.html" rel="related"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; (the trillions of microbes in our digestive system) play a role in our overall health, including how we process fat. But pinpointing the exact beneficial microbes and how they help us has been much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fat-fighting microbe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, new research has identified Turicibacter in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; as a key player, a bacterium long suspected of influencing fat metabolism. In a paper &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413125004413" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, scientists detail exactly how it exerts its protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kendra Klag at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City and her colleagues first isolated the specific Turicibacter bacterium from other microbes. Then they tested its protective effects on different groups of mice, including those bred without any existing gut bacteria and standard lab mice. The mice were fed either a regular diet or a high-fat diet, and some were also given the bacterium as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then measured key health metrics, including body fat, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and blood fat levels. They found that Turicibacter drastically reduced obesity and improved metabolic health even in mice on a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;The mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how Turicibacter was doing this, the team analyzed mouse gut and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; and found that the bacteria were producing their own lipids (fat molecules). They purified these bacterial fats and gave them to the mice, and observed that they alone (without the bacteria) were enough to prevent obesity. These lipids helped suppress the body's production of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-unexpected-lipid-obesity-therapies.html" rel="related"&gt;ceramides&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fat that builds up when an individual has a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high-fat+diet/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-fat diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data identify a novel bacterial-host lipid network that promotes host metabolic health and holds therapeutic promise," wrote the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the research has people wondering whether gut bacteria could be our new weapon against obesity. The idea is not that far-fetched. The researchers also found that low levels of Turicibacter are linked with obesity in humans, which could pave the way for probiotic supplements to treat the metabolic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

By analyzing genetic data from over 150,000 people with depression, researchers identified distinct genetic regions linked specifically to early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with high genetic risk for early-onset depression were twice as likely to attempt suicide within a decade. The findings highlight a critical window for early intervention and suggest that genetics could eventually guide personalized suicide-prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Genetic Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression before age 25 shows stronger genetic influence than late-onset cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Suicide Probability:&lt;/strong&gt; One in four individuals with high early-onset genetic risk attempted suicide within 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Gene Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Twelve genetic regions were linked to early-onset depression, compared with two for late-onset cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression in young adulthood has a stronger hereditary component and is associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts than depression that begins later in life, according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics &lt;/em&gt;by researchers at Karolinska Institutet, among others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that genetic information will be able to help healthcare professionals identify people at high risk of suicide, who may need more support and closer follow-up,” says Lu Yi, senior researcher at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, and one of the study’s corresponding authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a common mental illness that can affect people at different stages of life. The new study shows that depression that begins before the age of 25 has a stronger hereditary component than depression that begins late in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major genetic differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, based on medical records and genetic data from over 150,000 people with depression and 360,000 controls in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, compared genetics and risk of suicide attempts in people who had their first depression before the age of 25 (early onset) and those diagnosed after the age of 50 (late onset).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic differences between the groups were large. The researchers identified twelve genetic regions that were linked to early onset and two regions that were linked to late onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in four people with a high genetic risk of early-onset depression attempted suicide within ten years of diagnosis, which was about twice as many as people with a low genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We show that early-onset depression has partly different genetic causes than depression that affects older individuals and that the risk of suicide attempts is increased,” says Lu Yi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important step towards precision medicine in psychiatry, where treatment and preventive measures are tailored to each individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suicide prevention in healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now plan to investigate how the genetic differences are related to brain development, stress and life experiences, and whether genetic risk profiles can be used in suicide prevention in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is a collaboration between Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, the University of Oslo, Norway, Copenhagen University Hospital and Roskilde University in Denmark, the University of Tartu in Estonia and the Nordic research network TRYGGVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;It has been funded by, among others, the European Research Council (ERC) and the US National Institute of Mental Health. Some of the authors have collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, but none that are related to the current study.

Overall, the two MDD subtypes correlated moderately (genetic correlation, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.58) and differed in their genetic correlations with related traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that eoMDD and loMDD have partially distinct genetic signatures, with a specific developmental brain signature for eoMDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, we demonstrate that polygenic risk scores (PRS) for eoMDD predict suicide attempts within the first 10 years after the initial diagnosis: the absolute risk for suicide attempt was 26% in the top PRS decile, compared to 12% and 20% in the bottom decile and the intermediate group, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings can inform precision psychiatry approaches for MDD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:11:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQM3Vtb25mZlc4U1RhNm1Vd2lmcThrMlg5bW80X0xLWkgtakdlYmFhUnlKVmN0ZkNQYnhmejVheTJWN0M2TjJjZEVEUG1zTDRYTkU3Ty03UVJpS3BFWDJoRlJSaDJjc2UtUnBWNHFTOWNzREVXSFpDYU1KWkhwTFNEXw</guid></item><item><title>FDA终止雌激素黑匣子警告-此举可能永远改变更年期护理-女性世界</title><link>https://www.womansworld.com/aging/menopause/how-fda-lifting-black-box-warning-on-estrogen-changes-menopause-care</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-591214 single-format-standard post-how-fda-lifting-black-box-warning-on-estrogen-changes-menopause-care theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eating ultra-processed foods could lead to an increased risk of being diagnosed with precancerous colorectal growths for women under 50, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2841354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published Thursday in JAMA Oncology, looked at health outcomes for 29,105 nurses under 50 who underwent at least one colonoscopy. Participants were followed from June 1991 until June 2015 and filled out questionnaires about their eating habits every four years. The researchers looked at two forms of precancerous polyps: adenomas and serrated lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who had an average of three ultra-processed food servings per day had a 3% risk of a precancerous polyp, while women who had an average of 10 or more ultra-processed food servings per day had a 5% risk, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 5% of adenomas are cancerous, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15370-colon-polyps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but about 75% of colorectal cancers start as these growths. The study did not find any links between ultra-processed foods and serrated lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do see an increase in risk with more servings of ultra-processed food products," said CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline   Gounder, the editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods account for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-calories-ultra-processed-foods-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the average American's diet, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though most dietary guidelines recommend restricting them. Ultra-processed foods have also been linked to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ultra-processed-food-health-issues-cancer-early-death-research/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;dozens of other health issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, including diabetes, sleep issues, heart trouble and early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who ate more ultra-processed foods also had a higher body mass index, and were more likely to have a history of smoking, according to the research. They also tended to have lower levels of physical activity and consume fewer nutrients like fiber and Vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if there are any good ultra-processed foods," Gounder said. "Clearly the more you're eating, the worse for your health, the higher the risk for various complications." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-are-they-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;don't have a set definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but they often include packaged foods and beverages, items made without many whole ingredients, and less obvious products like condiments and sauces. Study participants who had diets higher in sugars and artificial sweeteners, as well as packaged savory snacks, had higher rates of adenoma development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government has said it is planning to define ultra-processed foods, Gounder said. In the meantime, a "good rule of thumb is: if you can't pronounce an ingredient on the package, it is probably an ultra-processed food," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still working to determine exactly how ultra-processed foods affect the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that the ultra-processed foods are changing your microbiome, so those are the bacteria in your gut. So that causes increased inflammation, it can cause increased permeability of the gut wall," Gounder said. "And then secondly, we know ultra-processed foods are associated with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes which we also know increase the risk of various cancers, including perhaps colon cancer." &lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who was at the &lt;b&gt;Taylorsville InstaCare&lt;/b&gt; location at &lt;b&gt;3845 West 4700 South&lt;/b&gt; on &lt;b&gt;November 7&lt;/b&gt; between &lt;b&gt;3 p.m. and 7:15 p.m.&lt;/b&gt; may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if those at the InstaCare location did not have direct contact with the infected patient, they remain at risk because measles can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Taylorsville location during the timeframe shared by the health department is being urged to confirm their measles immunity status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday morning, 74 measles infections have been confirmed across the state of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccine recommendations:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children&lt;/b&gt; should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults born before 1957&lt;/b&gt; generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated before 1968&lt;/b&gt; should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963–1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later&lt;/b&gt; are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, healthcare workers, international travelers) should have two doses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Ethiopia on Friday confirmed its first Marburg outbreak after nine cases were identified in a southern region of the country that borders South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the Ethiopian government’s fast action, saying it showed a “commitment to bringing the outbreak under control quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia’s government had reported on Thursday that it was investigating a possible outbreak of an unidentified viral hemorrhagic fever and was lauded by the continental health emergency body, Africa CDC, for its transparency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO sent a technical team on Thursday to support the East African country in testing and outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“WHO is also providing essential supplies, including personal protective equipment for health workers and infection-prevention supplies, as well as a rapidly deployable isolation tent to bolster clinical care and management capacity,” the U.N. agency said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak was reported in the southern region of Omo, which borders South Sudan. Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya said Thursday that the outbreak was a concern because “South Sudan isn’t far and has a fragile health system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No other African country has reported Marburg virus cases in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Ebola, the Marburg virus originates in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bedsheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases death from extreme blood loss. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnxoct00383b78mzdgq549@published"&gt;We’ve noticed there’s more and more “ass to pussy.” How do the women who do it in porn do it? Do they gobble antibiotics? Do they have secrets for cleaning out really well? Do they just suffer with infections for the sake of a paycheck? Or is it not really as unsafe as we’re told?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwn001z3b78to66am6j@published"&gt;I don’t think the best question here is how adult performers with vaginas mitigate the risks of transferring anal bacteria to those vaginas. Everyone has their own tricks and tips. Many of these methods are medically unsound. Adult is pretty crucial to the adult film industry—there are mountains of paperwork to prove that everyone is of age—so performers are considered able to weigh the risks, the financial pressures, and their own boundaries to make their own decisions. Much like you and your girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwn00203b782w67qdle@published"&gt;Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the associate medical director at Planned Parenthood, has the answer to your last and most relevant question: “Unfortunately, transitioning from anal penetrative sex directly to vaginal penetrative sex can lead to vaginal infections. It’s important to understand that while the vagina has lots of bacteria, the GI tract has much more bacteria and different bacteria that shouldn’t be present in the vagina, and this can lead to infections in the vagina that can be difficult to treat.” The risks are significant: “In worst case scenarios, an infection of this time can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which is when a vaginal infection progresses to the uterus or fallopian tubes.” Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause permanent damage, including fertility problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnts2l00343b78aapt0yuo@published"&gt;There are some ways you can mitigate this, but most aren’t all that helpful. “Things like anal douching before anal sex or washing fingers, toys, or penis after anal sex can reduce this risk, and help might avoid an infection every time, but the infection risk is still high,” De-Lin said. Since I expect the lure of something risky, or forbidden, or whatever it is that interests you about inserting your penis into your girlfriend’s vagina directly after being in her asshole, is strong enough for you to write in, I’m hoping De-Lin’s last suggestion will suffice: “The best bet is to use a new condom when transitioning from anal to vaginal sex, or make sure that the progression is from vaginal to anal instead.”&lt;/p&gt;

Whenever I would see my partner in person, we rarely had sex unless we had been drinking. I chalked this up to the stress of traveling, the stress in the relationship, etc. Now that I’ve left the relationship and am dating again, I’m finding that I still have a hard time getting over the nerves of sleeping with someone without alcohol. I’m bisexual and have noticed this showing up no matter the gender of the person I’m on a date with. I otherwise have a healthy relationship with alcohol and drinking culture. I’m 28 and sloppy drunk first-time hookups feel juvenile now, but how the hell am I supposed to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="185" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhwnrnwp00283b78t9kco9ph@published"&gt;You might tell your potential partners something like “I’m working through some anxiety right now and am not sure how far I want to go sexually tonight, but I’d like to see what happens.” Or, “I definitely want to kiss you, and I’m not sure about anything else.”&lt;br&gt;Listen to your body. You can find the edge of anxiety—that blurred space where you’re a little past your comfort zone but you’re able to stay present and engaged—and hang out there for a while. Take some deep breaths. Exist in the moment. If you start to check out, call for a stop and do something that grounds you. For some people, that’s holding ice, or biting a lemon. For others, it’s a mental exercise or even a physical one. Whatever you have to do to inhabit your body and get back into the present. If checking out is a thing that you notice recurring, that’s something you’ll need to warn your partners about. Instead of a safeword, you’ll want them to understand that an absence of positive feedback means they should stop what they’re doing and disengage.&lt;/p&gt;

Did he just, like, grunt as he motioned in the general area of his balls? Truth be told, I have no idea what your boyfriend wants you to do with his balls. He might like them pulled. He might like them sucked. He might like you to pop ’em in your mouth like little bits of breaded chicken or lap at them so lightly as though you’re catching snow with your tongue. Ask him. If you’re too embarrassed, go down and start kissing them gently, maybe licking them for bit and wait for him to direct you. If he doesn’t, ask him if he likes what you’re doing after a few minutes. If he still doesn’t have anything to add, it could mean one of two things: You can do whatever and he’ll be happy (in that case, rejoice: An easy-going partner is a gift), or he’s not such a ball play connoisseur after all and it still doesn’t really matter what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

It has taken us to some unexpected, yet interesting places, and I’ve done things I never would have agreed to had we discussed it ahead of time.

In a separate email interview with CNET, Mata explained how long he expects the gel to last. "The gel is biodegradable, and the process to remineralize takes approximately two weeks.  It is applied once, and it will endure as native enamel would, depending on people's health habits." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research shows it works on heavily damaged enamel &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dental enamel has a unique structure, which gives enamel its remarkable properties that protect our teeth throughout life against physical, chemical and thermal insults," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/new-gel-restores-dental-enamel-and-could-revolutionise-tooth-repair" target="_self"&gt;said Abshar Hasan&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow and leading author of the study. "When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural, healthy enamel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process was effective even when the enamel was severely worn and the dentine below was exposed, according to the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata said he believes the gel can be used as a preventative solution to avoid dental fillings, although dentists we spoke with are more cautiously optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If used as a preventive solution, it can avoid getting to the dental filling stage," said Mata. "In a way, it needs to be managed as a chronic disease where patients need to start at home with more education and care. Having said this, we have been working on this for 16 years, which has allowed us to develop quite a bit of know-how to understand, control and shape the technology. Because of this, we now have a versatile technology that will derive into multiple types of products. I believe that in the future, dental fillings will be a possibility." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mata says he's "very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind. It is safe, can be easily and rapidly applied, and it is scalable." He's started a startup called Mintech-Bio and hopes to have the first product out next year, according to New Scientist, following the clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dentists are cautiously optimistic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNET reached out to several dentists to get their perspective on the gel.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bianca Velayo, a general dentist in Henderson, Nevada, and multipractice owner at &lt;a href="https://www.pdshealth.com/" target="_self"&gt;PDS Health&lt;/a&gt;, was cautious about the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dental materials like this rarely hit the market overnight, even with exciting results," she says. "After early lab success, the real test is how it performs in the human mouth under real-world conditions: heat, saliva, bacteria, diet and daily habits. Between lab research, multiple trial phases and regulatory approval, it usually takes five to 10 years before we'd see a material like this in everyday dental use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Velayo also says she's excited about the prospect of these replacing traditional dental fillings in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gel hints at the future of dentistry, where we could actually regrow what's been lost. It's the difference between repairing and truly healing the tooth," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another dentist and multipractice owner at PDS Health, Ahmad Mokbil, said that the treatment has potential, but he doesn't believe it'll be possible anytime soon, as it requires a shift in educating patients, dentists, dental coverage and treatment protocols. However, he pointed to existing technology that's in use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We use an FDA-approved treatment called Curodont, which has similar characteristics and is effective for treating early tooth decay," Mokbil said. "The number of applications required can vary depending on how the tooth responds, the size of the cavity and how early the intervention takes place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNQkR2Z0tjNXliOXdFTVZLVnNTbDZGa0hSazhRS1g5OUlXb1lmWm5TOWhYa1J2UGk1MDQ5eXBXTUFQMWNQZ1dqeGpoLWhiV1hhRGFOYXZOZHMwb0t0TDRqV3lMZUgxdlBicFdYVkItUHljMkdER1lBMWJFMzJpUzRSMFNwTUxYQmdRbDJteXlSMVJvcC1TTmdObFBxLTZ5TlV3cTg3dFhQZw</guid></item><item><title>新研究发现脑肿瘤中的细菌在癌症生长中起着“令人惊讶”的作用-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-study-finds-bacteria-in-brain-tumors-play-surprising-role-in-cancer-growth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Newly published research in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-025-01073-3"&gt;Nature Cancer&lt;/a&gt; suggests that bacteria inside brain tumors may play a far more active role in how cancers grow, spread and respond to treatment than previously understood, according to Prof. Ravid Straussman of the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists considered tumors as places where bacteria didn’t grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But now we know that bacteria live inside tumors and can change how cancer cells behave and how fast they grow and spread,” Straussman told The Times of Israel. “The realization that diverse bacterial populations may play a role in cancer compels us to rethink our assumptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking findings raise the possibility that bacteria play a more active role in cancer progression and the infiltration of metastases into the brain than scientists had previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Certain bacteria can make cancer cells more resistant to chemotherapy,” Straussman said. “Patients with more bacteria in their brain tumors tended to have poorer survival outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="New study finds bacteria in brain tumors play ‘surprising’ role in cancer growth"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctoral student Elinor Gigi, assisted by staff scientist Dr. Nancy Gavert from Straussman’s lab, led the research in collaboration with Prof. Shlomit Yust-Katz, head of the Neuro-Oncology Unit at Rabin Medical Center, and Dr. Ayelet Shai, director of the Breast Oncology Unit at Rambam Health Care Campus. Scientists from Hebrew University, Northwestern University and Baylor College of Medicine also participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how bacteria interact with cancer cells opens new possibilities for better, more targeted therapies for brain tumors,” Straussman said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bacteria are present in ‘all types of brain tumors’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the differences in bacteria in glioblastomas, which are aggressive primary brain tumors that originate in the brain itself, and brain metastases — secondary tumors that originate in other parts of the body, such as the lung and breast, and then spread to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“We found that bacteria are present in all types of brain tumors we examined,” Straussman said. “Interestingly, brain metastases contained a higher diversity and abundance of bacteria compared to glioblastomas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Straussman’s group reported finding bacteria inside cancer cells taken from the bone, breast, lung, ovary, pancreas, colon and skin. The scientists also found bacteria in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was quite surprising because the brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier, a selective and semipermeable shield that normally prevents bacteria from entering the brain,” Straussman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some bacteria might travel inside cancer cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the scientists analyzed 322 samples of glioblastoma and brain metastases and found bacteria both inside cancer cells and within nearby immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3688041" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/4-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3688041" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/4-1-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

On the right, after antibiotic treatment, amino acid uptake ceased. (Courtesy/Weizmann Institute of Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists observed that about 40 to 50 percent of the bacteria in brain metastases were similar to those found in the patients’ primary lung or breast tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that some bacteria might travel inside cancer cells from the primary site as they metastasize to the brain. The bacteria might also have metabolic traits that could help them promote cell migration, tissue invasion, and tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;h3&gt;Location of the brain tumor matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of the researchers’ discoveries was that the bacterial composition of brain metastases varied depending on where they were located in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumors in the posterior region contained richer and more diverse bacterial populations than those closer to the front of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We assume that varying conditions in different parts of the brain, such as differences in blood supply or in the metabolic composition of the surrounding tissue, may account for this,” Straussman said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated whether bacteria could influence the efficacy of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By culturing 30 bacterial species found in glioblastoma tumors, the scientists found that some species made cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to fight these bacteria would be “unpredictable or even harmful,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is better to modulate these bacterial effects, rather than “ignoring them or eliminating them indiscriminately,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patients with fewer bacteria survived longer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that the survival time of patients with brain metastases was linked to the bacteria in their tumors. People with more bacteria in their brain tumors lived less than those with fewer bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain bacterial species may even render brain tumors resistant to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of treating brain metastases is not only due to their location in the brain — which can impair cognitive and physical functions — but also from their biological makeup, “which often renders them resistant to existing therapies,” said Shai of Rambam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study revealed that brain tumors contain diverse bacterial communities that can influence immune responses and inflammation,” she said. “These findings bring us one step closer to more effective diagnosis and treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now researchers say internet searches for the anti-anxiety drug surged after the show’s release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lorazepam, also known by its brand name Ativan, is a type of drug known as a benzodiazepine, or “benzo”. It is thought to work by boosting the effect of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers in the US say the name-dropping of lorazepam on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-white-lotus" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt; has fuelled a rise in interest around the drug and how to access it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Olivia Maynard of the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study, described the data as striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That this TV show is causing people to explore purchasing benzodiazepines online is particularly concerning because there is a huge amount of illicit production of benzodiazepines, and these drugs are often dosed incorrectly and/or inconsistently and sometimes contain different drugs entirely,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Recently, some illicit ‘benzodiazepines’ which people have bought online have been found to contain nitazenes, a dangerous synthetic opioid, which could lead to overdose or even death if taken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego analysed data from Google, finding that, while searches for lorazepam were stable from January 2022 to the end of the first week of February 2025, they surged after the third season of The White Lotus was released on 16 February and remained at increased levels for the next 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, the team say there were almost twice as many searches relating to lorazepam over this 12-week period than would normally be expected, equating to about 1.6m additional searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was also an increase in the number of searches about how to get hold of lorazepam, with such queries about 64% higher than expected for the 12-week period – reflecting about 30,000 extra searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, no such spikes were seen for searches related to alprazolam or clonazepam – benzodiazepines not mentioned in The White Lotus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.4931" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal JAMA Health Forum&lt;/a&gt;, cannot unpick whether people were simply searching for information about lorazepam or buying the drug, the researchers say the results raise concerns given the rise in prescribing of such medications and the increase in illegitimate online pharmacies selling benzodiazepines without prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers also warn The White Lotus did not portray the risks of suddenly stopping lorazepam – noting this can cause panic attacks, agitation, and seizures – or convey the dangers of drinking alcohol while taking benzodiazepines. As the NHS website notes: “It can make you sleep very deeply. You may have breathing problems and difficulty waking up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers say the entertainment industry should develop ‘best practice’ approaches to how prescription medications are shown, adding the use of health information panels could sate curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Harry Sumnall, a professor of substance use at Liverpool John Moores University, said that, while signposting to further advice and support is sometimes included at the end of shows, there are other approaches to keeping viewers safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Whilst it could be useful if entertainment shows incorporated health advice where potentially harmful products are prominent, I don’t think this is realistic to expect from a creative point of view, and there is the risk that heavy-handed warnings can lead to counterproductive outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Where access to medicines is concerned, I think the greatest impacts will be seen through enforcement action against illicit manufacturers and unregulated providers, and prescriber education, as over-[prescribing] or inappropriate prescribing of clinically useful but potentially harmful medicines remains a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNc0NKQnBRZTQtejVsU3FTOXo0cFRYV0lPdGJIbWpKeVVVUWFTTjZyeWRVUE9TanVMeV9DY2xINktCOWNXU0xCRDZzYkxRemdjMjFmWWo0SGRIUDhiYVhqbV9HemVKZVBOcVN0azBmMENJZ0tTUVc1YlZPOFVOTVFqMDFzSzdWTmVYYlRrd0xxZnhjZE9xY0dqdTlOSGc0UlB5X1YtWERMc1FXMUNmR0E</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， “白莲花”引发了网上对高风险焦虑药的兴趣-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/white-lotus-sparked-online-interest-162320017.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The latest season of “The White Lotus” delivered big ratings for HBO - and fueled a surge of Google searches for a risky antianxiety prescription drug featured on the show, according to research published Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The paper, published in JAMA Health Forum, highlights Hollywood’s outsize cultural influence and the common use of benzodiazepines, a class of anxiety-relieving medications that can cause physical dependence and agonizing withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The third season of the show, which depicts well-heeled guests at a luxury resort in Thailand, includes a storyline of a mother hooked on lorazepam pills and her husband who starts to steal and take them as he faces financial ruin and criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers from the University of California at San Diego found that Google searches for lorazepam and two benzodiazepines with different names remained stable for years before the release of the show’s third season in February. Searches for lorazepam skyrocketed for the next 12 weeks, nearly 99 percent higher than expected - representing 1.6 million additional searches. During that time, searches for similar drugs, alprazolam and clonazepam, remained at expected levels, the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many of the queries asked how to get lorazepam, although that doesn’t mean viewers bought them, said Kevin Yang, the study’s lead author and a psychiatrist specializing in addiction at the UC-San Diego School of Medicine. “But it’s at least a good indicator of public interest in that medication,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yang got the idea for the study on his couch while watching “The White Lotus” with his now-wife. “It almost felt as if it was being glorified,” Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A long history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Benzodiazepines - which include drugs such as Xanax and Valium - are commonly prescribed for anxiety, bouts of panic and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The sedative drugs are highly effective but should not be used longer than two to four weeks because of the risk of dependence, said Alexis Ritvo, assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a member of the nonprofit Alliance for Benzodiazepine Best Practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Very rarely are people adequately educated about that before they’re given a prescription for these meds,” Ritvo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The medical community has long known about the dangers of prolonged use of benzodiazepines, or benzos, as they are often called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued stronger warnings for benzodiazepines, detailing the risk of abuse, addiction and withdrawal symptoms. The updated boxed warning came amid rising concerns about benzodiazepine abuse, with the agency estimating half of prescriptions were for longer than two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Stopping the drugs abruptly after prolonged use can worsen anxiety and insomnia, leading some patients to start again on higher doses. Withdrawals can last months or even years. Nicole Lamberson, a physician assistant who began taking prescription Xanax for anxiety in her early 20s, spent eight years battling withdrawal symptoms. During that time, she became gaunt and bedridden, afflicted by bedsores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was crippled with panic, anxiety, terror, racing thoughts, suicidality. I was fully dissociated,” said Lamberson, medical director of the Benzodiazepine Information Coalition, a nonprofit aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients have access to other pharmaceutical anxiety medication, including SSRIs and buspirone. Earlier this year, the American Society of Addiction Medicine published new guidelines for reducing doses for patients who have been regularly taking benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Long-term benzodiazepine use poses other risks such as memory loss, difficulty concentrating and brain fog - particularly dangerous for elderly patients susceptible to falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Benzodiazepines can also amplify the effects of other prescription drugs or alcohol. “If you have an opioid problem or alcohol problem, adding benzos to the equation is like pouring gasoline onto a fire,” said Wayne Kepner, a Stanford University addiction researcher involved in the “White Lotus” study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Victoria, the mother taking lorazepam in “The White Lotus,” slurs at dinner while drinking wine.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have also noted cases of “designer” benzos - which are not approved for medical use but can be purchased online - creeping into the illicit drug supply, an added wrinkle to the nation’s drug crisis. Sometimes known as “benzo dope,” the mix of opioids such as fentanyl and benzodiazepines slows breathing and heart rate and lowers blood pressure, increasing the possibility of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cultural imprint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Benzodiazepines have long made appearances in popular culture, reflecting their common use as a prescription and recreational drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Books, TV shows and movies have depicted or hinted at housewives grappling with suburban malaise by taking Valium. The hard-partying stockbroker in “The Wolf of Wall Street” mentions taking Xanax to “take the edge off.” Hip-hop artists rap about them, and not always to glorify - Future’s “XanaX Damage” is about the drug’s harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have a culture of, ‘You work hard, keep going, you shouldn’t feel pain, you shouldn’t feel distress,’” said Ritvo, the addiction psychiatrist. “If you feel anxious, if you feel overwhelmed, then you should do something to take that feeling away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An HBO spokesperson did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The visibility of benzodiazepines on “The White Lotus” could serve as a learning moment, the study researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the paper, they noted the surge in Google searches showed “a level of engagement that few public health interventions achieve in such a short time frame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yang and Kepner, in an interview, suggested that such shows could include disclaimers on benzodiazepine misuse or steer viewers to help lines or websites, as is often done when media touches on suicide, child abuse or gambling. “There needs to be some discussion on guardrails,” Kepner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On “The White Lotus” (spoilers ahead), Victoria Ratliff appears to be spared excruciating withdrawal as her husband, Timothy, raids her lorazepam supply and descends into a detached, drugged haze. He considers killing himself and his family but eventually runs out of the drug and finds peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/11/14/phillips-collection-deaccessioning-okeeffe-seurat-dove/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Phillips Collection will sell several masterpieces, sparking backlash;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Phillips Collection will sell several masterpieces, sparking backlash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2025/11/14/ken-burns-american-revolution-documentary/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ken Burns says Americans have been fighting each other since the beginning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ken Burns says Americans have been fighting each other since the beginning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/13/trump-administration-ends-penny-production/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:So long, penny.

is becoming a "silent epidemic" among men — and what they can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn’t just about heartburn, but about systemic inflammation that starts in the gut and spreads throughout the body," Gioffre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;While gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects both men and women, men tend to experience more severe symptoms and complications.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Acid reflux is the body’s alarm system, warning that the gut, metabolism and stress response are all out of balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/mens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Men today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Men today&lt;/a&gt; are living in a "pressure cooker," Gioffre warned. "Chronic stress, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:poor sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt;, processed foods, alcohol and medication overuse are destroying gut health and digestion," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Combine that with typical diets heavier in meat, alcohol and ultraprocessed foods, and a greater tendency to ignore symptoms, and you’re breeding a perfect storm for chronic inflammation and increased risk of reflux compared to women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/even-low-calorie-processed-food-causes-weight-gain-testosterone-loss-men-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Even Low-calorie Processed Food Causes Weight Gain, Testosterone Loss In Men, Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even Low-calorie Processed Food Causes Weight Gain, Testosterone Loss In Men, Study Suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night eating, larger portions, less fiber and high caffeine intake also stack the deck against men, he said. In addition to dietary choices, men’s lifestyle behaviors can also impact digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Late-night eating and larger portions are part of what make men more prone to acid reflux and other digestive issues.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many men skip meals, eat too quickly and rely on &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:convenience foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;convenience foods&lt;/a&gt; stripped of minerals and fiber," Gioffre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this "ongoing acid assault" erodes the gut lining, drives acid upward and turns normal esophageal cells into precancerous Barrett’s cells, increasing cancer risk dramatically, he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ultraprocessed foods, Gioffre called out three specific components that worsen acid reflux: refined salt, sugar and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/cooking-oil-linked-colon-cancer-early-study-tied-inflammation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seed oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, they inflame the gut and weaken both digestion and the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach where it belongs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men also tend to drink more coffee than women, often two to three cups a day, usually on an empty stomach, Gioffre pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That constant caffeine hit strips minerals, dehydrates the body and spikes acidity — all of which increase the risk of reflux."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/breakfast-timing-may-hold-key-living-longer-new-research-reveals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Breakfast Timing May Hold The Key To Living Longer, New Research Reveals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast Timing May Hold The Key To Living Longer, New Research Reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he said, "men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes. Otherwise, reflux will only keep getting worse and harder to treat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some biological differences between the genders that contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/mens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:men’s higher risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;men’s higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of severe gastrointestinal conditions, according to Gioffre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Men produce less protective mucus and saliva — the body’s natural defense system that buffers acid when it backflows into the esophagus. So when acid reflux strikes, it hits harder," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That acid burns and erodes tissue that was never designed to handle acid in the first place, setting the stage for inflammation, damage and long-term complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger men also tend to carry more visceral (abdominal) fat, Gioffre noted, which increases pressure in the stomach and forces acid up into the esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/scientists-reveal-how-your-favorite-soda-could-quietly-mess-your-mood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Reveal How Your Favorite Soda Could Quietly Mess With Your Mood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists Reveal How Your Favorite Soda Could Quietly Mess With Your Mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones also play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/womens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Estrogen in women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Estrogen in women&lt;/a&gt; appears to protect the esophagus by improving blood flow and mucosal repair, protection men have much less of," the doctor said. "Without lower levels than women, their tissue where reflux hits doesn’t recover as quickly from repeated acid exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gioffre recommends that men take the following simple steps to immediately begin lowering their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the biggest and most overlooked causes of acid reflux is eating &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:too close to bedtime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;too close to bedtime&lt;/a&gt;," Gioffre said. "When you lie down after a meal, gravity is no longer helping to keep acid in your stomach where it belongs, so it’s much easier for it to travel up the wrong way into your esophagus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reflux symptoms often get worse at night, the doctor noted — "and it’s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why reflux symptoms often get worse at night, he noted — "and it’s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gioffre said it’s best to stop eating three hours before bed, which gives the body time to fully digest, empty the stomach and drop acid levels before lying down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common triggers include garlic, onions, spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and carbonated water, according to Gioffre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Download The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Download The Fox News App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs," he said. "Once that muscle relaxes, acid flows upward, causing heartburn by inflaming and irritating the esophageal and throat lining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor also recommends adding back alkaline minerals, digestive enzymes and a high-quality probiotic. Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leafy greens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gioffre recommends starting the morning with warm lemon water with a teaspoon of local honey, or a tea with slippery elm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This helps soothe and calm the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:upper GI tract;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;upper GI tract&lt;/a&gt; and eases reflux," he said. It’s also important to stay hydrated throughout the day, the doctor added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple grounding practices, like walking barefoot in the grass, doing deep breathing or just stepping outside to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reconnect with nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reconnect with nature&lt;/a&gt;, can help promote gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Esophageal cancer is up to nine times more common in men, making them far more likely to progress from chronic reflux to serious outcomes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These activate your parasympathetic ‘rest-and-digest’ system, calm your gut and keep acid levels in check naturally," Gioffre said. "Get outside and move after meals, and swap your late-night snack for deep breathing or stretching."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When men don’t sleep well, the body produces more cortisol, which is the main &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress hormone;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High cortisol keeps you locked in a constant state of fight-or-flight, and when you’re in that mode, your body isn’t focused on rest, digest or repair — it’s focused on survival," Gioffre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this state, blood flow is pulled away from the gut and sent to the muscles and brain, he noted, which means digestion slows down, stomach acid production drops and food sits in the stomach for too long, which leads to bloating, gas and more reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to heal reflux naturally, you can’t just change what you eat — you have to change &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:how you live;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;how you live&lt;/a&gt;," Gioffre said.

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D may help lower blood pressure in people with pre-existing high blood pressure and low vitamin D levels.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The recommended daily vitamin D intake for adults up to 70 years is 600 IU.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is important for many parts of your health, including your bones, immune system, and muscles.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research on how vitamin D supplements impact blood pressure is mixed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What seems most promising is that vitamin D might help lower blood pressure if you already have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-blood-pressure-facts-5649309" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-2224209" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt; to begin with. In these cases, the supplement may offer a small boost in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypertension-7368341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But even then, the blood pressure-lowering effect isn’t guaranteed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Older adults who are both low in vitamin D and have high blood pressure may benefit the most. For them, taking vitamin D may help improve blood pressure as part of an overall plan that includes a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/diet-or-exercise-for-blood-pressure-7563429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet, exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly medication.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to how much vitamin D you should take to lower blood pressure. In research studies, the dose of vitamin D has ranged from 800 to 4,000 IU (international units) per day. Interestingly, higher doses don’t always lead to better results for blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Here are the general daily recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Infants (0–12 months): 400 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children and adults (1–70 years): 600 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults over 70: 800 IU per day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may need more, especially if they’re at higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-deficiency-3014720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. This includes people with limited sun exposure, darker skin, certain health conditions, or older age. Many experts recommend around 1,000–2,000 IU per day for these groups.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re unsure how much you need, talk to your doctor. They may order a simple blood test to check your vitamin D level.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people can safely take vitamin D every day at the recommended amounts. But it is possible to take too much, especially if you’re using high-dose supplements for a long time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taking too much vitamin D can lead to a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/too-much-vitamin-d-8401436" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To avoid this, stick with the daily recommendation for your age, and don’t exceed the safe upper limit of 4,000 IU per day unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Karolinska Institutet have discovered how mammalian cells prevent the gradual buildup of harmful mutations in mitochondrial DNA, the small but vital genome that powers every cell. The study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea4660" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, explains how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintains its integrity despite its uniparental mode of inheritance and rapid mutation rate.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and undergoes recombination that can remove mutations, the mtDNA is passed down exclusively from the mother. This makes it vulnerable to the irreversible accumulation of mutations, a process that, over generations, could lead to a mutational meltdown and threaten species survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid this fate, evolution has equipped cells with two protective mechanisms: a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+bottleneck/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;, which is a stochastic process that transmits only a subset of all mtDNA copies present in the mother to her children, and purifying selection, which is an active process that weeds out mutated mtDNA molecules as the oocyte develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fewer mitochondrial DNA in the mother—lower mutation burden in the offspring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, scientists did not know if and how these two processes were connected or how purifying selection worked at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers discovered that when fewer mitochondrial DNA copies are passed from mother to offspring, there is more &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/genetic+variation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic variation&lt;/a&gt; between individuals and fewer harmful mutations are transmitted. In other words, a smaller genetic bottleneck allows purifying selection to work more effectively, removing defective mtDNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when the researchers disrupted the cell's ability to recycle damaged mitochondria by impairing autophagy, this protective filtering weakened: harmful &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mutations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mutations&lt;/a&gt; accumulated, and mtDNA quality declined.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that the size of the mitochondrial bottleneck determines how effectively mutated mitochondrial DNA can be removed during maternal transmission. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how mitochondrial inheritance remains stable over &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+time/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;evolutionary time&lt;/a&gt;," says Nils-Göran Larsson, Professor at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how cells preserve mitochondrial genome integrity is not only of evolutionary interest—it has major biomedical implications. Mutations in mtDNA are implicated in a wide range of diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By uncovering the link between mitochondrial turnover, bottleneck size, and selection, we now have a clearer view of how cells can maintain healthy mitochondria—and where this process might fail in disease," says Laura Kremer, first author and currently researcher at the University of Göttingen (formerly at Karolinska Institutet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings establish a framework for studying how mtDNA quality control could be enhanced therapeutically, offering new perspectives for conditions driven by mitochondrial genome instability.&lt;/p&gt;

Hospital X-rays showed hundreds of tiny gold threads surrounding the joint. The threads were intentionally left in place during gold-thread acupuncture, a technique that implants metal to extend stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her case raises practical concerns about safety, evidence, and how embedded metals can complicate routine imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clinical image case, radiographs showed thickened inner shin bone and prominent bony spurs near the joint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here subchondral sclerosis, hardening just below joint cartilage, appeared with narrowing of the medial joint space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images also revealed numerous radiodense strands clustered around the knee. Those lines are radiodense, bright on X-rays because metal strongly blocks the beam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Wan-Hee Yoo, M.D., at &lt;a href="https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/en/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chonbuk National University&lt;/a&gt;. His research focuses on rheumatology and imaging in arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold threads add visual clutter that can mask edges used to judge wear and alignment. That can make precise grading of osteoarthritis, chronic joint cartilage loss that causes pain and stiffness, more challenging in busy clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gold-thread-acupuncture"&gt;Gold thread acupuncture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold thread acupuncture implants &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9997604/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;short sterile wire&lt;/a&gt; segments through standard needles and leaves them in soft tissue. The goal is constant stimulation without repeated needle sessions during flares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been hypothesized that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/copper-and-gold-deposit-found-near-canadas-golden-triangle-just-59-feet-below-the-surface/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; thread implanted at the acupuncture points acts as a continuous acupuncture stimulation,” wrote  Yoo. The statement reflects how practitioners expect the metal to keep sending a mechanical signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method is offered in parts of East Asia for joint pain and swelling. It differs from routine acupuncture, needle insertion at mapped points to reduce pain, because it leaves a lasting foreign body behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the metal stands out on X-rays, physicians can follow thread position over time if needed. That visibility helps when deciding whether a foreign body, any material that is not native to the body, has shifted or is stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-issues-with-gold-thread-acupuncture"&gt;Issues with gold thread acupuncture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports describe thread fragmentation, migration, and tissue damage in a minority of patients, with one open-access &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8137335/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; documenting recurrent infection in the lower leg after prior back implantation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hypothesized that fragments traveled over years, seeding a site that later inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case, the patient developed cellulitis, a deep skin infection that spreads rapidly through soft tissues. Radiographs of the leg showed many threads embedded in the area that hurt and swelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another clinical report described extensive gold threads in the wrists and hands of a woman with long-standing rheumatoid disease. The disease had progressed by the time specialist care began after earlier reliance on thread implantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cautionary theme is delay. When people depend on unproven implants, they can miss timely disease-modifying treatment, medicines that slow or halt immune attack on joints, in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-doctors-consider-before-mri"&gt;What doctors consider before MRI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetic scanners interact with metal, so screening is standard before imaging. An evaluation found that gold and certain stainless steel &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ear-acupuncture-proves-to-be-an-effective-treatment-for-weight-loss/"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; needles were MR compatible under test conditions, and did not heat in those tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies still vary because safety depends on exact composition, length, and location. A safety listing notes 24k &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/supergiant-gold-deposit-discovery-wangu-field-might-be-largest-ever-found-on-earth/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; sutures as MRI conditional, which means scanning proceeds only when specific conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when scanning is allowed, metal can distort images by creating artifacts that hide soft tissues. That distortion can limit how well radiologists assess cartilage, synovium, the thin lining that normally lubricates joints, or nearby vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many patients, X-ray tracking remains the simplest way to monitor thread position. Ultrasound can also help map superficial strands without exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gold-thread-acupuncture-lessons"&gt;Gold thread acupuncture lessons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visible threads tell two stories at once, one about pain and one about choices. People often turn to alternatives when standard nonsteroidal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ginseng-improves-exercise-performance-and-helps-body-quickly-recover/"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; drugs, medicines that reduce pain and swelling, cause stomach upset or stop helping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major guidelines for knee osteoarthritis emphasize exercise, weight control, and topical or oral NSAIDs, medicines that reduce inflammation and pain by blocking certain body chemicals, with steroid injections during flares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conditionally consider acupuncture for some patients, but they do not evaluate implanted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/over-100-tons-of-gold-discovered-in-a-once-hidden-mine-doropo-ivory-coast/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; threads as a recommended option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence for gold-thread implantation remains thin and case-based. Without controlled trials, it is hard to weigh benefits against risks like migration, infection, imaging artifacts, and the possibility of delayed definitive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients deserve clear information about how a permanent implant could affect future tests or therapies. Discussing plans with a clinician before any procedure helps match goals to treatments with known safety profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This woman’s images are striking, yet the lesson is simple. Relief is the goal, but the path should keep options open for scans, surgery, and proven medicines if they become necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1202540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:15:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOYWp2TEdyYkNBX25lY3JnMFFpZUhuM2dVc2VWd25xNl9nX0txVGhPdDNOdU1FNS1ieTc5d1NrSW1xT3Atc3FHN2J4ZlFTd2lVQ3pZWWU0LXFYVWtMT2U4U3Y5LXhMbGxFV1JGWDhTZ3FJZlFjNEpETy1CUTVRZ0ItaTZPd0Vockt5WWxCUXJNcFM2NXZXODdMR1hRbFk4Zw</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿州可能出现人类禽流感，美国9个月内首例- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/human-bird-flu-possible-washington-state-us-months-rcna243905</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a84ec7" class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials in Washington state say they have identified the nation’s first human case of bird flu since February, &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;pending confirmatory testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cffd2f" class="body-graf"&gt;A Grays Harbor County, Washington, resident preliminarily tested positive for the infection, the Washington State Department of Health said Thursday.
