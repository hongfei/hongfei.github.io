                &lt;h1&gt;Naperville Urges Mosquito Precautions After West Nile Virus Found&lt;/h1&gt;
                                              
                &lt;p class="lead"&gt;
Two mosquito traps tested positive for West Nile virus on Oleson Dr. and Jackson Ave.                &lt;/p&gt; 
                &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAPERVILLE, Ill. —&lt;/strong&gt; Naperville urges residents to prevent mosquito bites and take precautions such as removing standing water after two traps recently tested positive for West Nile virus on Oleson Drive and Jackson Avenue. City crews have sprayed the immediate areas, checked for breeding sites and retreated area catch basins. As a further precaution, the city will spray the areas around the Last Fling festival during the morning of Friday, Aug. 29, to help reduce the mosquito population near the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prevent mosquitoes from hatching, city crews remove standing water and treat ponds, marshes, and catch basins with safe chemicals during mosquito season from April through October. Crews also monitor traps weekly for West Nile virus and the effectiveness of the treatment. When necessary, the city will use spraying to help control the population of adult mosquitoes. The city uses the safest chemicals at low volumes and sprays only as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus transmitted by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. Most people who are infected with the West Nile virus have no symptoms or experience very mild symptoms three to 14 days after the bite from an infected mosquito. Mild symptoms include a fever, headache and body aches, occasionally with a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph glands. Less than 1% of those infected develop severe symptoms, with people over 50 at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions to “Fight the Bite”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prevent mosquito-borne illnesses, reduce mosquitoes around your home and take these precautions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing, including long pants, long sleeves, shoes with socks from dusk to dawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mosquito repellent containing 25% to 35% DEET when outdoors, applied sparingly to skin or clothing, as indicated on the repellent label. Consult a physician before using repellents on young children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for and repair any tears in residential screens, including porches and patios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate stagnant water in birdbaths, ponds, flowerpots, wading pools, tires and any other receptacles in which mosquitoes might breed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to keep roof gutters clear of debris and keep grass cut short and shrubbery well-trimmed around your home to eliminate mosquito hiding places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;A Penn State Health doctor expects cases of measles to appear in the wake of an out-of-state visitor exposing others at several sites across the region, including one in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the exposures, the state Department of Health issued a warning Thursday and has urged residents to be on alert for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposures came from a visitor from another state who made stops in four Pennsylvania counties: Adams, Clearfield, Lancaster and York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Lancaster County, those who were at the Midway Mennonite Reception Center, 210 E. Lexington Road, Warwick Township, on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9 may have come into contact with the visitor who was contagious with measles, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locations, dates and times of other exposures include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Sapp Bros. Travel Center, 15196 Clearfield Shawville Highway, Lawrence Township, Aug. 5 between 1 and 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Farmhouse Restaurant at the Barn Resort, 75 Cunningham Road., Cumberland Township, Aug. 7 between 5 and 8:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Hickory Falls Entertainment Center, 110 Hickory Lane, Penn Township, Aug. 7, between 7 and 10 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Garber Mennonite Fellowship, 6082 Old Hanover Road, Heidelberg Township, Aug. 10, between 8:30 a.m. and two hours after the conclusion of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its 2023 IRS tax filing, Midway Mennonite Reception Center is listed as a tax-exempt 501(c)3 corporation with a mission “to provide a conservative meeting facility for the church and its functions of weddings, funeral meals, ordination meals, special topic meetings, youth gatherings and other church functions and meetings.” A message left with a contact for the center Thursday was not returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-bio"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What should I do if I think I have measles?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call ahead before you seek care — the doctor’s office, emergency department or urgent care facility will need to take precautions for your arrival.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you call:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe your symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any possible measles exposures you’ve had&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask for instructions on how to come in safely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may also call the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 877-PA-HEALTH to receive guidance on what to do if you were potentially exposed and have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to watch for and do&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This most recent exposure emphasizes the importance for parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated against measles,” Dr. Pia Fenimore, a pediatrician at Lancaster Pediatric Associates and vice chair of pediatrics of Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health said by email Thursday. “Exposures cannot be controlled, the best and only defense for measles is vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenimore added that the vaccine is very safe and effective, and said that reports of autism and other harms are false. Parents who are concerned should speak with their health care provider or seek reliable information from online sources such as such as Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's &lt;a href="http://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Education Center&lt;/a&gt; or nonprofit organization &lt;a href="http://www.immunize.org" target="_blank"&gt;Immunize.org&lt;/a&gt;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-quote tncms-inline-alignment-right tncms-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Fahmida McGann&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nine out of 10 people who are vulnerable to measles will get measles."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Dr. Fahmida McGann, infectious disease physician at Penn State Health Lime Spring Outpatient Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious known pathogens, said Dr. Fahmida McGann, infectious disease physician at Penn State Health Lime Spring Outpatient Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nine out of 10 people who are vulnerable to measles will get measles,” McGann said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include people who are unvaccinated, undervaccinated or immunocompromised — a category that McGann said includes people with severe liver disease or uncontrolled diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent exposures, McGann said she expects there to be a couple of cases in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have been exposed to measles and don’t know their vaccination status can receive a dose of the vaccine to help protect them, something that’s usually recommended to be done within 72 hours, McGann said — but this is still a good idea even if more time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the virus here is of particular concern as vaccination rates of kindergarten and seventh grade students in Lancaster County have fallen below the levels needed to maintain herd immunity against measles. During the 2024-2025 school year, rates of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine were 88.5% in kindergarten and 85.4% in seventh grade, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/programs/immunizations/rates" target="_blank"&gt;data from the state Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Herd immunity is the level of immunity needed in a population to stop uncontrolled spread of an illness, and is typically considered to be around 95% for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin with fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis), followed by a rash that starts on the head and spreads downward, according to the state Department of Health. Without proper protection or supportive care, measles can be deadly. Symptoms can start seven to 21 days after a person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who believe they were exposed to measles and are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider or call the state Department of Health toll-free hotline at 877-PA-HEALTH. All residents are encouraged to monitor for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;READ: &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/could-measles-appear-in-lancaster-county-schools-this-fall/article_56f1b17c-fb88-4d74-9da1-b1d1fbbc313a.html" target="_blank"&gt;Could measles appear in Lancaster County schools this fall?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Measles a nationwide concern this year&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the nation experiences its highest level of measles cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;since 1992&lt;/a&gt;, Lancaster County recorded one case earlier this year, in an unvaccinated individual who visited Lancaster County following a trip to Texas and was treated at WellSpan Ephrata Community Hospital, as &lt;a href="https://lancasteronline.com/news/health/pa-department-of-health-reports-measles-case-at-wellspan-ephrata/article_a6c92aea-2f1e-47ac-96c8-8764e6b6d4c1.html" target="_blank"&gt;LNP | LancasterOnline reported&lt;/a&gt;.

It can also detect infections without symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you see increased wastewater viral activity levels, it might indicate that there is a higher risk of infection.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Levels of Covid in wastewater are rising nationwide, estimates show, suggesting an uptick in infections in the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, wastewater data suggested that Covid infections are now rising in 45 states, compared to in 40 over the previous seven-day spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the five states now at very high levels, four are experiencing an uptick compared to the agency's previous data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii has had very high levels of Covid in wastewater for the last three weeks, estimates suggest, as the state records a 'summer wave' of infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii is often ranked as the top tourist destination for Americans in polls, with about 4.6million visiting the state every year, although numbers this year were slightly below those expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid hospitalizations have also risen nationwide, up 30 percent with an estimated 1.3 admissions per 100,000 in the week of July 26, the latest data available, compared to one in the previous seven-day spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are not rising, however, with 167 fatalities recorded over the week of July 19, the latest available, roughly similar to the level recorded the previous two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can take longer to rise, though, because of the time taken for someone to fall seriously ill after being infected and then succumb to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The figures are far off those at the peak of the pandemic, when there were more than 30 hospitalizations per 100,000 people every week and 25,000 deaths per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the Covid wastewater situation in Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospital admission rate, or proportion of admissions due to Covid, is rising in four of the five states with very high Covid levels, and fastest in Hawaii, where it rose 17 percent in the week of August 9, the latest available, to 3.4 percent of all admissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are no suggestions in any of these states that restrictions may be brought in to curb the spread of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new variant first arrived in the US in March, after appearing in Southeast Asia in January, with some of the first cases reported in New York and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a recombinant virus, meaning it was formed when two other strains of Covid infected the same cell and then swapped genes to create a 'chimera' virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization has classified the strain as a 'variant under monitoring' after lab analysis suggested that it may be more infectious than other currently circulating strains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The XFG variant, formed from two Omicron strains, was behind an estimated 14 percent of Covid cases over the week of June 21, the latest date available, up from 11 percent from two weeks earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says that it receives little data on variants from the states every year, leading it to have 'low confidence' in the estimates, but it warns that the variant is likely causing an increasing proportion of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency's wastewater estimates are based on reports from hundreds of sites across the US that analyze the water for signs of Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An uptick indicates more people are shedding the virus, suggesting that infections are rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf430/8236450?login=false"&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A man who lived with severe, treatment-resistant depression for over 30 years is now in remission, thanks to a new brain stimulation method that targets selective areas of his brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man reported &lt;a href="https://osf.io/n3u8k/files/osfstorage"&gt;experiencing joy&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in decades after the treatment. “He was crying and saying, ‘I’m not sad, I’m just happy. I don’t know what to do with these emotions’,” the study’s first author, Ziad Nahas, a psychiatrist and professor at the University of Minnesota, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nahas and a team of researchers across several universities developed a personalized method to implant electrodes and precisely send weak electrical signals into brain areas believed to be involved in depression. By fine-tuning this stimulation using the patient’s feedback, the treatment has relieved the participant’s symptoms for up to two years. Their findings are detailed in a new preprint on &lt;a href="https://osf.io/6dpnx"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When depression resists treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s single participant initially contacted the researchers while they were recruiting for a new clinical trial. At the time, he had been living with treatment-resistant depression for three decades, having first been hospitalized at age 13. Since then, he had undergone multiple hospitalizations and tried dozens of treatments alongside intensive psychotherapy. He had also attempted suicide three times.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Treatment-resistant depression is a common form of major depressive disorder that does not improve significantly after at least two standard treatment attempts, such as medications or therapy. In such cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—which stimulates the brain using weak electrical currents—is often considered a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/electroconvulsive-therapy-can-erase-unwanted-memories-1488586221"&gt;next step&lt;/a&gt;. While ECT has been used for decades and can be effective for some patients, it fails for others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this patient’s case, brain stimulation had previously failed to alleviate any symptoms. He had undergone two courses of electroconvulsive stimulation therapy. The first was moderately effective, but the second and third brought no relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that most ECT studies stimulate specific brain areas based on a standard brain atlas, Damien Fair, a neuroscientist and professor at the University of Minnesota and a study co-author, explained to Gizmodo. That means that researchers don’t often know exactly which area they’re targeting, since everyone’s brain is different. “It’s a one-size-fits-all approach,” said Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A tailored approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address this, the team developed a personalized stimulation method tailored to the participant’s brain. First, they used functional MRI (fMRI) to map the borders of his brain networks previously linked to depression. This revealed that the patient’s salience network, which processes external stimuli, was about four times larger than in people without depression, potentially contributing to his symptoms, Fair said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers surgically implanted four clusters of electrodes into the brain, over the borders of these brain networks. A few days later, they began sending electrical signals into each of the four networks individually.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When they stimulated the default mode network (DMN), a group of regions linked to internal thought processes, the patient began to experience happiness. Nahas immediately called Fair. “[Nahas] said, ‘You won’t believe it. We stimulated the default network, and [the participant] is breaking down in tears of joy,’” Fair recalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“In psychiatry, we don’t have cures, but this is probably the closest we can get.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stimulating the action-mode network, which is involved in planning, and the salience network both led the man to report a sense of calm. Targeting the frontoparietal network, which is involved in decision-making, resulted in improved focus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, the patient received electrical stimulation in the various brain networks each day for 1 minute, every 5 minutes. The researchers continued to adjust the stimulation settings each month using a statistical method that incorporated the patient’s daily feedback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By seven weeks post-surgery, the participant no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. By six months, his symptoms had significantly improved. By nine months, he had entered full remission. That remission has lasted for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The uniqueness of PACE is combining very precise, individualized targeting of multiple networks and tuning the parameters so the patient can receive the most benefit,” Nahas said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team has since implanted a second participant and plans to implant a third. Ultimately, they aim to conduct a double-blind clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nahas recently received an email from the original participant, who had embarked on a road trip with his family. He was enjoying his trip, he said. “In psychiatry, we don’t have cures,” Nahas said, “but this is probably the closest we can get.”&lt;/p&gt;

She rolled the widows down and listened to music as she drove. But then her vision splintered and she saw multiples in front of her, so she pulled over for the roughly 10 seconds it lasted. After calling her brother, she decided to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f3b17" class="body-graf"&gt;“The ER doctor asked me a bunch of questions,” she recalls. Initially, “everything that I answered didn’t seem to alarm him.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86082c" class="body-graf"&gt;But then he inquired if she felt numbness, and she said she had “a little teeny bit" along her jawline. That response “concerned him,” so he sent her for the scans. Rodrigues felt surprised that when he returned, he was so certain of the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7efb88" class="body-graf"&gt;“He said, ‘I know what’s going on with you,’ which I hate hearing that from doctors because that means they absolutely know what it is,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26cd37" class="body-graf"&gt;He told her she had Stage 4 lung cancer that spread to her brain. Rodrigues felt stunned because she had no symptoms at all and had not smoked for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1aeb4f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am generally in excellent health,” she says. In fact, the year before her diagnosis, she'd had a lung x-ray because of a flutter in her heart, and it didn't detect anything in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9539f2" class="body-graf"&gt;The emergency room doctor admitted Rodrigues to the hospital so she could undergo more testing to determine what type of lung cancer she had. Scans revealed the cancer had spread from a nodule in her lung to her liver, the base of her spine, to two ribs and her brain, where she had 47 metastases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94a80c" class="body-graf"&gt;“There was an element of shock in there,” she says. “I’ve gratefully had a meditation practice for a really long time, and the very first thing that struck me when he said (my full diagnosis) was like, ‘Oh that’s what they’ve been talking about all this time, about impermanence.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6b1680"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1864"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg" alt="After a brief visual disturbance, Tania Rodrigues visited the emergency room and learned she had Stage 4 lung cancer with 47 metastases in her brain."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After a brief visual disturbance, Tania Rodrigues visited the emergency room and learned she had Stage 4 lung cancer with 47 metastases in her brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Tania Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d01ec0" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors characterized her visual impairment as a seizure, even though she didn’t experience other symptoms, and they put her on an anti-seizure medication.

At the same time, experts have noticed an increase in young people, mostly women, with non-smoking lung cancers, Dr. Danny Nguyen, a medical oncologist and hematologist at City of Hope in California, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a671c0" class="body-graf"&gt;The causes of lung cancer in non-smokers remain unclear, and researchers are trying to understand why it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b28f33" class="body-graf"&gt;“In terms of risk factors, I think it’s hard to really pinpoint right now,” Nguyen says. “Some of these risk factors include potentially radon (exposure), pollutants in the air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-996069" class="body-graf"&gt;Non-smokers who get lung cancer often have a mutation in a gene called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, which can cause the cancer to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-431e42"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2032"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg" alt="Since being diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, Tania Rodrigues appreciates the beauty of life more."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, Tania Rodrigues appreciates the beauty of life more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Tania Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-885ec2" class="body-graf"&gt;Several targeted therapies work effectively on managing Stage 4 EGFR lung cancers. A recent phase 3 clinical trial shows that a combination of two therapies, Rybrevant and Lazcluze, increased survival for patients with metastatic lung cancer, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e19f8e" class="body-graf"&gt;“We definitely have those patients that are on that trial who are still alive right now because of that trial,” Nguyen says. “There are many other clinical trials for lung cancer as well.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0960ea" class="body-graf"&gt;Having treatments that work for patients diagnosed later remains essential as many people do not have symptoms until their cancer has progressed. Even then, the most common symptoms, such as a cough, are usually a sign of more benign conditions, and doctors often consider those before lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbaf7a" class="body-graf"&gt;“What I’ve seen is a lot of these patients may present with a cough that just doesn’t go away,” Nguyen says. “They try antibiotics, they try inhalers and try steroids. It maybe gets better for a little bit then comes right back.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76956b" class="body-graf"&gt;Current screening recommendations for lung cancer only apply to smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84329d" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of times these patients don’t look like they should have lung cancer,” Nguyen says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f91f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Many patients are like Rodrigues and learn they have cancer when a scan for something else picks up a mass in the lungs. Doctors should consider lung cancer especially if patients present with symptoms — such as coughing up blood or a persistent cough — because it can impact anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-083711" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have lungs, you can get lung cancer,” Nguyen says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-34a4ab" class="body-heading"&gt;‘My Life is Full’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc6620" class="body-graf"&gt;Thanks to her years of meditation, Rodrigues quickly accepted that rest of her life will always include cancer treatments. Since starting on the new therapy, she has felt better and returned to doing things she loves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d9e1ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“I trained in martial arts. I did it for years and years, almost 20,” she says. “My training slipped off … I started back at training in martial arts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-066976" class="body-graf"&gt;Having cancer has changed her perspective on life. She appreciates nature more, noticing that the “greens are brighter,” and that people are “way more interesting.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-1307bc"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1889"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-05-f34b8e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-05-f34b8e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-05-f34b8e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-05-f34b8e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-05-f34b8e.jpg" alt="Tania Rodrigues feels grateful that lung cancer treatments have improved, allowing her more time to appreciate life."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Tania Rodrigues feels grateful that lung cancer treatments have improved, allowing her more time to appreciate life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Tania Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a0825" class="body-graf"&gt;“My life is full,” she says. “I am really grateful that I get to take a spin on this globe.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9a3635" class="body-graf"&gt;Rodrigues also feels lucky that recent research has allowed for numerous “advancements for the treatment of cancer.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a94d1" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If someone had gotten this news even 10 years ago, it would have been a totally different situation than it is today,” she says. “Today, I have a lot of hope.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:43:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNOGFVV0tmUzNSdlh3SFhUenFaNUp6ckxqb1pBRzVuVXd3clEzVUtUV2Z2eXFjWXhHM3lxcV9LME5ULXFkbXVWWVIyQ2RwZWxlMXZfX1ZwQU1reGVMbEV4YXg4WkdxNEZONW5JYmZ6ZDlGUm5MczlwRUlsWVhvVHZxd3pjYUtHSWVnM19oRXR0VFVHU3RYdGwzQUFYX3FxQUF2bjFLbnhpZ1NGUVB6ZG05ZGpIMjXSAVRBVV95cUxNWmNmN3A1Wmtrd2JyQi15cFBYb0RCZ0JkRDd2T3RDSFZYWFJUdXl3ZFFrQ2RCS1lRQ3pzMlV2cUlDMHpGV0x5TDl4U0xlYUstSGtNQkw</guid></item><item><title>嘿，旧金山，最好现在就接种新冠肺炎疫苗-旧金山标准</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9yUWFrQlBPeU4zWEQxNzhtdkd1ZFhsVXBXWDJoa2lpWkhiYjd0ek1DbzBnQlk5eTVJUE8xWl9GWEF5VDhTZE56ZXZHZjgzZXBnMU81blNOQTR3c2lNaUZMM2dPSmtBQU1kVU9JZFh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Time may be running out for people under 65 to get vaccinated against Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Health experts are warning that the Food and Drug Administration as soon as Friday may &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/health/fda-covid-vaccines.html"&gt;restrict eligibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for the upcoming 2025–26 formula to high-risk populations.

Wastewater levels for Covid are peaking in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Texas, Nevada, and Utah, according to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;San Francisco is caught in the surge. The risk of Covid is “high” throughout the city, according to data from &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?plantId=e9e87e61&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22Southeast%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22e9e87e61%22%7D&amp;amp;charts=CjIQACABSABaBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyNS0wNy0xMHIKMjAyNS0wOC0yMYoBBjhmMDQ4YsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=8f048b&amp;amp;target=N%20Gene&amp;amp;locationExpanded=true"&gt;wastewater treatment plants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Influenza and RSV rates are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines,” said Matt Willis, the former Marin County public health officer, alluding to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/health/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-trump.html"&gt;casting doubt on immunizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. “So, I’m worried the federal foot-dragging will get us the vaccine late and that it will be too narrow in who can get it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Amid the uncertainty, San Francisco health officials have adopted a cautious position. The Public Health Department urged residents to stay up to date on Covid vaccinations, noting that anyone who has not yet received the 2024–25 vaccine should do so immediately. The agency recommends two doses for those 65 and older or immunocompromised. Officials also advise people to consider wearing well-fitted masks in crowded indoor spaces and to stay home if sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We continue to monitor federal vaccine guidance for the upcoming 2025–26 respiratory virus season,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Kennedy has narrowed access to Covid shots. In May, he updated guidelines that &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459978/rfk-jr-vaccine-pediatrics-public-health-lawsuit"&gt;removed pregnant women and healthy children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; from the vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Once updated guidelines are rolled out, pharmacies will dispose of any unused doses of the 2024–25 Covid vaccine, according to UCSF immunology expert Dr. Peter Chin-Hong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Even people who remain eligible for the vaccine may be less likely to get it because of confusion over who qualifies, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;On Aug. 19, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Covid shots for all children ages 6 to 23 months, a stronger stance than the CDC’s recommendation, which leaves the choice to parents and providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among children are likely to rise under the new vaccine rules, according to Chin-Hong. CDC data show children under 2 accounted for 57% of pediatric Covid hospitalizations in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“What happens is no one gets it, because patients are confused,” Chin-Hong said of the vaccine. “It’s the people who are vulnerable who get caught up in the confusion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The San Francisco Standard</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:28:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9yUWFrQlBPeU4zWEQxNzhtdkd1ZFhsVXBXWDJoa2lpWkhiYjd0ek1DbzBnQlk5eTVJUE8xWl9GWEF5VDhTZE56ZXZHZjgzZXBnMU81blNOQTR3c2lNaUZMM2dPSmtBQU1kVU9JZFh3</guid></item><item><title>活力超过90岁的人通常在60岁后开始练习这8个习惯- VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxPM3dBaUplSzg2OC16NFBYdDBTOE82MmZnVFhCaUpJNWZON1gwLVdDWHdLSFhPV3dSQThOSmx2ZUZuOU0ySFVjbHdmanI1dGs0cDViWE1ualh1bXVYMTBTWWlLei1TYjI3RDlFcEI5WmpfSENNZGVqQmJsenJNQzMtcTNHakNOellnekJGc0dDTDdndlMyUjNWa1J6czV4WUZwZnZsN0F1VUw0cDZPVnlueG5nbXJ5VHh6Ni0tWVpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="326" data-end="477"&gt;Longevity without vitality isn’t much of a win. Living to 90 only matters if you can still walk, laugh, and create memories with the people you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="479" data-end="696"&gt;What’s interesting is that many people who thrive into their 90s don’t start off as perfect models of health. Instead, they make key changes later in life—often after 60—that set them up for a vibrant final chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="698" data-end="759"&gt;Here are eight habits that tend to show up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="766" data-end="807"&gt;1. They keep moving every single day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="809" data-end="982"&gt;We all know exercise matters, but here’s the twist: the 90+ crowd rarely turns into gym rats. Instead, they focus on movement they enjoy—walking, gardening, yoga, tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="984" data-end="1258"&gt;Dan Buettner, who studied the &lt;a href="https://danbuettner.com/evidence-of-longevity/?.com"&gt;world’s Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt;, found that the longest-lived people don’t “work out” in the modern sense. They simply move naturally throughout the day. As he put it, “Longevity happens to people who have the right lifestyle, not the right genetic code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1260" data-end="1494"&gt;I’ve noticed this on my own travels. In small towns in Italy, I watched men and women in their 70s and 80s walk to the market every day. It wasn’t exercise—it was life. And that consistency, multiplied over decades, builds vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1671"&gt;The key here is sustainability. It’s not about pushing yourself to the brink in a spin class. It’s about weaving movement into your life so that it never feels like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1678" data-end="1709"&gt;2. They eat with intention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1711" data-end="1880"&gt;This doesn’t mean they follow the latest fad diet. Instead, they make conscious choices about food. Smaller portions, more plant-based meals, fewer processed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1882" data-end="2127"&gt;One friend of mine switched to mostly plant-based eating at 65 after his doctor warned him about cholesterol. Now in his 80s, he bikes with his grandkids. He swears it’s not just what he cut out, but what he added in—beans, leafy greens, nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2129" data-end="2454"&gt;Science backs him up. Research shows that people who adopt &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190807092326.htm?.com"&gt;plant-forward diets&lt;/a&gt; later in life still reap the benefits, including better heart health and lower inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2456" data-end="2650"&gt;And let’s be real: at 60, food often becomes less about indulgence and more about function. People who thrive past 90 learn to see food as fuel for tomorrow rather than just comfort for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2657" data-end="2697"&gt;3. They maintain a learning mindset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2699" data-end="2780"&gt;What keeps you sharp into your 90s isn’t just crossword puzzles—it’s curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2782" data-end="2985"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but when I interviewed a retired teacher in her late 80s, she said the secret to her energy was “never stopping school.” She still takes online courses and joins book clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3221"&gt;The brain, like a muscle, responds to use. Psychologist Carol Dweck’s research on &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/04/gs-04thinkpositive/?.com"&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt; applies here: people who believe they can keep learning actually do. And that belief translates into vitality well past retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3223" data-end="3530"&gt;I’ve seen this in small but powerful ways. A man I know in his late 80s started learning Spanish at 70 because he wanted to travel. He never became fluent, but the process itself kept his mind sharp. He still jokes, “I know just enough Spanish to order a beer anywhere in Mexico—and that’s enough for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3537" data-end="3581"&gt;4. They build strong social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3583" data-end="3777"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-power-and-prevalence-of-loneliness-2017011310977?.com"&gt;Loneliness is as damaging to longevity&lt;/a&gt; as smoking a pack a day. That’s not my opinion—that’s data from the Harvard Study of Adult Development, one of the longest-running studies on human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3779" data-end="3930"&gt;Those who live longest often invest heavily in relationships. They stay connected to old friends, make new ones, and engage with younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3932" data-end="4120"&gt;When I visited Okinawa, Japan—a region famous for its elders—I noticed how many people over 80 still meet daily for tea or small community projects. They laugh. They gossip. They belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4122" data-end="4189"&gt;That sense of belonging, more than any supplement, sustains them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4191" data-end="4418"&gt;And here’s a small but important detail: they don’t just wait for others to reach out. They initiate. They call, they invite, they check in. It’s this proactive approach that turns acquaintances into lifelong support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4425" data-end="4473"&gt;5. They cultivate flexibility, not rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4475" data-end="4614"&gt;This one surprised me at first. We think of older people as “set in their ways.” But the vibrant 90-somethings I’ve met are the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4616" data-end="4716"&gt;They adapt. They pick up new hobbies, try new foods, and embrace technology instead of fearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4718" data-end="4902"&gt;A neighbor of mine started photography at 68. Now he’s 92 and still takes better photos than I do. He says, “The moment you stop trying new things is the moment you start shrinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4904" data-end="5121"&gt;Psychologists would call this &lt;a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/9oeGu5FI?.com"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking and behavior to new situations. It’s one of the strongest predictors of both mental sharpness and emotional resilience in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5123" data-end="5331"&gt;And it doesn’t always look grand. Sometimes it’s as simple as learning how to FaceTime the grandkids or experimenting with a plant-based recipe. Each small act of openness compounds into long-term vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5338" data-end="5370"&gt;6. They protect their sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5372" data-end="5547"&gt;Sleep often gets ignored in longevity conversations, but it’s a core pillar. Studies link &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-well-and-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia-and-death-2021050322508?.com"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with higher risk of dementia, cardiovascular problems, and faster aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5549" data-end="5737"&gt;Interestingly, many people I’ve spoken with didn’t get serious about sleep until later in life. After years of late nights and stressful jobs, they finally realized rest wasn’t optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5739" data-end="5927"&gt;One 91-year-old I know swears by her evening ritual: herbal tea, dim lights, no screens after 8. “I wasted decades on too little sleep,” she told me. “Now I treat bedtime like medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5929" data-end="6179"&gt;And she’s not alone. Sleep scientists note that older adults who create &lt;a href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org/participants/discoveries/better-sleep-longer-life-benefits-regular-and-sufficient-sleep-pattern?.com"&gt;consistent bedtime routines&lt;/a&gt; not only live longer but live sharper. Sleep is when the brain clears toxins, when the body repairs itself. Miss it, and vitality slowly slips away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6186" data-end="6229"&gt;7. They find purpose beyond themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6231" data-end="6388"&gt;Viktor Frankl wrote, “Those who have a ‘why’ to live, can bear almost any ‘how.’” Purpose is not just a poetic idea—it’s linked to longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6390" data-end="6579"&gt;And here’s the thing: purpose doesn’t have to mean starting a foundation or writing a book. For many, it’s about caring for family, volunteering, mentoring, or even just tending a garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6581" data-end="6765"&gt;After 60, people who thrive into their 90s often reframe their identity. They’re no longer “retired,” they’re contributors in a new way. That sense of purpose anchors their vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6767" data-end="7010"&gt;I once met a man in Greece who was well into his 80s and still ran a small community choir. He said he could have quit years earlier, but “the music keeps me alive.” That struck me. Purpose doesn’t need to be grand—it just needs to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7017" data-end="7057"&gt;8. They manage stress intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7059" data-end="7130"&gt;Nobody escapes stress. But those who stay vibrant learn to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7132" data-end="7326"&gt;Some lean on meditation, others on prayer, others on simply spending more time in nature. I’ve seen people shift from high-stress jobs to slower living and flourish in ways they didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7328" data-end="7574"&gt;As noted by Dr. Elissa Epel, a stress researcher at UCSF, “How we respond to stress is more important than the stress itself.” People who develop calming practices—even late in life—protect their bodies from the wear and tear of chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7576" data-end="7853"&gt;And crucially, they don’t just &lt;em data-start="7607" data-end="7614"&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; stress—they build resilience. I met a woman who started practicing tai chi at 70. She told me, “It’s not about eliminating stress. It’s about giving my body and mind a rhythm to return to.” That rhythm has carried her well into her 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7860" data-end="7880"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7882" data-end="8013"&gt;The habits that fuel a long, vibrant life don’t require perfection. They require small, consistent shifts that compound after 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8015" data-end="8102"&gt;Movement. Food. Curiosity. Connection. Flexibility. Rest. Purpose. Stress management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8104" data-end="8150"&gt;Not glamorous, not trendy, but deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8152" data-end="8202"&gt;And the best part? It’s never too late to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms typically appear within two weeks of exposure and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, the release noted. If detected early, plague can be effectively treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CDPH said that it routinely monitors rodent populations across California for plague activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The department said that surveillance in El Dorado county from 2021 through 2024 identified a total of 41 rodents that showed evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far in 2025, four rodents have tested positive, county officials said, adding that they were all within the Tahoe Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This week’s case is not the region’s first brush with plague. The last confirmed human case in El Dorado county was in 2020, the statement added, and was also believed to be linked to the South Lake Tahoe area. Before that, the release says that two cases were reported in 2015&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/california-child-diagnosed-plague-yosemite" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; after exposure in Yosemite national park&lt;/a&gt;. All individuals were treated and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2021, the US Forest Service announced it was closing several popular sites at Lake Tahoe for several days&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/03/lake-tahoe-chipmunks-bubonic-plague" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; after discovering plague &lt;/a&gt;in the chipmunk population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The federal agency said at the time that “vector control” workers would complete “eradication treatments” in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, Colorado health officials also &lt;a href="https://county.pueblo.org/public-health-department/public-health-officials-confirm-first-human-plague-case-pueblo-county" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed a human case of the plague&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimates &lt;/a&gt;that there is an average of seven human plague cases a year in the US, with most of the human cases occurring in the western US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQME9MT3NJZVdDR3pJekF2UGRoaklXb3lWUU9BUEJfTWNremxPS1diQUNkTUJJRV92ZERUYkNkQ0JULS14YXQ0ZkpxTkRya0pPb3FJM2JxVlU5MzNDWHFyVWN5dmc4NTk0MDJ6UEhaa3VydFdpRUVPUjJpX0JWTldaenZQOEtOOWlXYnJPbDd2T1I</guid></item><item><title>爱达荷州卫生官员确认第三例未接种疫苗的儿童麻疹病例，表明疫情蔓延程度更高-东爱达荷州新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFBVV95cUxNLV9QSTVyNXRjMWlrdy1uQUhJWFp3bHprUThRbHBYTFUwaE9oSDFEWVR1OG1kN283R1kyZUQ2OWhsR3FDdlQwb19uRDZHOUdKTC1OUFBSQV8tdUdwQnpGS1NLSEQ1NkRfY3BqLXVHckZ2NlAzYWtxYjB5X1ZReFhOSl96RGdoamZZU29mSnZRYlhPRkF3MjM4R0ZqQzV2SC1yQVdJRS04R015TE14cUlXbzBFRS1ScC1WeW4tNDdXY0FNcnJfUFcxSDhGQTY0NnQ5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;BOISE (&lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-health-officials-confirm-third-measles-case-in-unvaccinated-child-suggesting-higher-spread/"&gt;Idaho Capital Sun&lt;/a&gt;) — Idaho reported the state’s third measles case in the last two weeks, after not reporting any infections this year during a national surge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials say they don’t know of a link between the &lt;a href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/news/measles-circulating-among-idaho-communities-health-officials-urge-consultation-healthcare"&gt;new measles case&lt;/a&gt; in Bonner County reported Wednesday and a separate case reported last week in Kootenai County, which are both in North Idaho. That means measles is likely spreading more, said Dr. Christine Hahn, Idaho’s state epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Without any link between these two confirmed cases in north Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it’s reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating,” Hahn said in a statement. “As we’ve seen with other states around the nation, cases can begin to multiply quickly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Idaho’s three measles cases are all in unvaccinated children. Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, which is highly contagious and usually leads to hospitalization for one in five children younger than 5 years old who are infected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, eastern Idaho health officials confirmed a measles case in Bonneville County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/08/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-eastern-idaho-resident-since-1991/"&gt;RELATED | First confirmed measles case in eastern Idaho resident since 1991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But officials said they didn’t think the public was exposed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/14/measles-reported-in-eastern-idaho-becoming-states-second-case-in-one-week/"&gt;In both regions of Idaho that have seen measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, the infections are the first reported in more than three decades and came shortly after early signs of the virus locally. Idaho hasn’t reported local measles cases since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is experiencing the worst outbreak of measles in decades. This year, health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; 1,375 measles cases across 41 states by Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC. About 13% of measles cases in the U.S. this year led to hospitalizations, the CDC reports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Officials encourage people to verify vaccination records&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Symptoms typically appear&lt;/a&gt; seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the CDC says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Idaho has a &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/traveler-visiting-eastern-idaho-had-measles-but-officials-dont-think-the-public-was-exposed/#:~:text=But%20Idaho%20has%20a%20spotty%20record%20for%20measles%20vaccinations%2C%20the%20Sun%20previously%20reported.%C2%A0"&gt;spotty record for measles vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxNLV9QSTVyNXRjMWlrdy1uQUhJWFp3bHprUThRbHBYTFUwaE9oSDFEWVR1OG1kN283R1kyZUQ2OWhsR3FDdlQwb19uRDZHOUdKTC1OUFBSQV8tdUdwQnpGS1NLSEQ1NkRfY3BqLXVHckZ2NlAzYWtxYjB5X1ZReFhOSl96RGdoamZZU29mSnZRYlhPRkF3MjM4R0ZqQzV2SC1yQVdJRS04R015TE14cUlXbzBFRS1ScC1WeW4tNDdXY0FNcnJfUFcxSDhGQTY0NnQ5</guid></item><item><title>传染麻疹的州外游客访问了多个宾夕法尼亚州中部县： DOH - local21news.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wJBVV95cUxNekJzdlAySGQ1UjV0SUJfN2RfRkk0dVo4Y2ozNWpkdWFEVEw2WTVMRHJoYkZfNHR6N1d1YlVfOHYxRWszZ1lvd0xBUHIwaGxQZHBaNzdKVkQ1LUlnRVpQYUszX0R3alM1bU9sOTVRYlMwT3BZenlqbTVZVjRfdVMtZWszTmFEUUNON1dZcXN5V1Yyd0syRUdJUEVPQTlnN2REQlRmdWZMUW9RTG4wQ1hqSnZxM3FzYXRQVlcyU2FDR1ZQM01HMHJJSGhHYl83blY1NEE3OUUzRDM3YkRQbUlGNk5hLURhUDJLY2o0bWdFNF82TTdzcG0wZU9tbUVrNVUwRElyVEF1Z1JCM3NsVk9MMEoxMnIyM1FUSVZaNE04VXBRZnY2eTVDNHJzVExxNzNRcGRRTWp3RWlLc0RjakZBSW50YWtnNEFDRU9NNXhYTnc0elNXUVc3TUlPYTl0anM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;HARRISBURG, Pa.

They were in Pennsylvania between Aug. 4 and Aug. 12.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials with the DOH said the person went to these places:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sapp Bros.

This year, notorious anti-vaxxer &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-jr-confirmed-hhs-secretary-what-this-means.html"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; is at the helm of the Health and Human Services Department and is already making changes to public-health guidance that suit his agenda. For example, in May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped recommending&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/cdc-recommendations-children-2025-covid-vaccine.html"&gt; the COVID-19 vaccine for children&lt;/a&gt; who are 6 months and older. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the country’s leading pediatrician group, opposes the decision, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/leading-pediatrician-group-recommends-covid-vaccine-infants-toddlers/story?id=124756899"&gt;saying on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID-19 vaccine &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be part of the annual immunization schedule for children between 6 and 23 months of age. To add to the confusion, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNjP-GiPPkm/"&gt;there are rumors&lt;/a&gt; circulating on social media that, as soon as Friday, the FDA could announce it is restricting access to the COVID vaccine to adults older than 65 and people with high-risk underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmnb13001h3b74cimtn2qh@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;With the COVID-vaccination landscape shaping up to be a hot mess, what does all of this mean for people who want to protect themselves — and their children — against getting infected with the virus in the coming months? Will RFK Jr. also bring his anti-vaccine views to bear on the government’s recommendations for the flu shot and RSV vaccine? And what else can we do to lower the risk of becoming sick in this environment? I called up Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection-control officer at Tufts Medicine, to chat about what to expect this cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmnqvx001q3b74hu99i9g2@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html"&gt;CDC’s forecasting models&lt;/a&gt; show that COVID-19 infections are currently growing in 34 states. Anecdotally, it sure &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-2025-summer-surge-rcna218754"&gt;feels like we are&lt;/a&gt; in a surge — I got the virus after traveling recently, while several co-workers and friends from across the country also came down with it this month. Doron says that an uptick in cases at this time of year is nothing out of the ordinary, however. While COVID-19 doesn’t exactly follow a seasonal pattern, experts have learned over the past few years to expect a summer wave. “In the fall, it typically goes down, and then it comes back up more in the winter,” Doron says. “The virus usually peaks just around January 1.” In other words: The current summer wave shouldn’t be cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmo39p00203b74r1dnbldd@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;Doron says whether people will have universal access to the COVID-19 vaccine this fall remains to be seen. FDA commissioner Martin Makary &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/"&gt;said in May&lt;/a&gt; that the agency would propose limiting new vaccines or so-called updated booster shots to people who are 65 and older, or those who are between the ages of 12 and 64 and have at least &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/who-is-eligible-for-a-covid-shot-what-to-know-about-the-fdas-latest-changes"&gt;one underlying health condition&lt;/a&gt; that puts them at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s unclear how exactly that translates into insurance coverage and access.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmolab002j3b74qmdsn6wb@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-rfk-jr-cdc-covid-vaccine-policy-changes-children-pregnancy.html"&gt;the CDC announced&lt;/a&gt; it would no longer recommend the vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. Still, the agency said kids who between 6 months and 17 years of age “may receive” the shot “informed by the clinical judgment of a health-care provider and personal preference and circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmop90002p3b74orjjjk1h@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other leading health organizations&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy"&gt; have also said&lt;/a&gt; pregnant people should continue to get vaccinated, because it’ll protect them and their infants after birth. These groups are urging insurers to continue covering vaccines for patients who are pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmouzu002u3b74h64fuqca@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;While Doron says that you certainly could do that, it may not protect you as effectively in the long run, because the formulation of the upcoming vaccine may be different than the current one to account for the most common COVID-19 strain circulating at the moment. But some protection is still better than none. Doron says that if you haven’t gotten vaccinated against COVID each year, it wouldn’t hurt to change that now. “You stand to gain more from getting it,” she adds. “The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to be somebody who would experience severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmp9ec00393b748kx6dzq0@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;The Trump administration has not updated its CDC recommendations for the flu vaccine so far, Doron says. “Health authorities have been recommending annual influenza vaccination for everyone over the age of 6 months,” she says. “We don’t expect any change in that.” The one thing that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different this year is that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would stop recommending influenza-vaccine formulations that contain the preservative thimerosal; the HHS secretary has long claimed that thimerosal has been linked to the “epidemic of childhood neurological disorders,” despite there being &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-what-rfk-jr-gets-wrong-about-autism/"&gt;no scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to support his position. “That’s probably not a big change for most people,” says Doron, largely because this preservative is rare. Only about 4 percent of all flu vaccines administered last fall and winter in the U.S. contained thimerosal, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-to-know-about-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-from-bygone-flu-shot-debate"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So in practice, people should be able to get the flu vaccine easily from their health provider this fall.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmpl7c003f3b74jq488vv9@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, better known as RSV, typically begins spreading in the fall as well. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; the RSV vaccine for pregnant people, adults over 75, and people over 50 with certain high-risk conditions. (As of now, the vaccine is a onetime dose, not an annual shot.) Infants under 8 months can also receive monoclonal antibody shots to help prevent infection. These guidelines are unlikely to change, according to Doron. “We don’t expect any sort of issues with access, reduced eligibility, or reduced insurance coverage,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmpwe4003p3b74sjn3th0g@published" data-word-count="112"&gt;When it comes to RSV, Doron recommends that those who are eligible get vaccinated in the late summer or early fall. That way, people will be protected by antibodies before cases begin spreading in earnest. For the flu, Doron says the general recommendation is for people to get their annual shot in late October to ensure they are protected through the winter and spring. Alternatively, patients can check out the website for their state’s health department to see how flu cases are trending locally. “You can be watching in September and October,” she suggests. “If you’re starting to see that curve go up, then bump that timeline up and get it sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmqon8003u3b74i6yiqkhi@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine can be harder to time because the virus doesn’t follow a very predictable seasonal pattern. “If you get your vaccine in October, it might cover you for that winter wave,” Doron says, “but it’s certainly not going to still be helping you very much by next summer.” She adds that this is due to how short-lived the vaccine’s efficacy is when it comes to preventing infection, even though it’s effective at preventing serious disease for much longer. Doron suggests either getting your COVID and flu vaccines simultaneously in the fall or waiting to get the COVID shot until two to four weeks before a big event you don’t want to miss — whether that’s a vacation, a wedding, or the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmqyax00433b74xhwabl89@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;While there’s no silver bullet to prevent infections, Doron says that maintaining healthy habits — a nutritious diet, good sleep, managing stress, working out, and treating underlying medical conditions — are key to strengthening your immune system. She recommends washing your hands frequently and avoiding touching your face. Doron added that wearing a high-quality, well-fitting mask can help decrease the risk of acquiring a respiratory virus in certain settings.&lt;/p&gt;

By targeting the sphingolipid-energy axis, nicotine improved energy homeostasis, preserved gut microbial diversity, and supported neuromuscular resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treated mice displayed a biologically younger phenotype based on integrated behavioral and metabolic analysis. The findings suggest nicotine’s molecular pathways may inspire the design of non-addictive compounds to promote healthy aging, though long-term safety in humans remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Reprogramming:&lt;/strong&gt; Nicotine altered glycolipid and sphingolipid pathways, improving energy balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice on nicotine showed delayed age-related motor decline and a biologically younger profile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Results may guide the development of safer, non-addictive cholinergic modulators for aging interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SIAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging is a systemic process marked by energy imbalance and organ-specific metabolic decline, with motor deterioration emerging as a key component of frailty. As the global population ages, challenges remain in healthy aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotine is the principal bioactive compound in tobacco. Smoking accelerates metabolic and cardiovascular disease. However, epidemiological studies suggest that smokers have lower risks of certain neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. It is unclear that whether nicotine itself can influence aging trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112365"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/motor-aging-nicotine-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These changes enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide availability, limited ceramide accumulation, and improved energy homeostasis, which are molecular adaptations that correlated with delayed motor decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by Prof. LIU Xin’an and Prof. CHEN Zuxin at the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with collaborators, for the first time demonstrated that life-long oral nicotine administration reprograms aging-related systemic metabolism via the sphingolipid-energy metabolic axis, and attenuates age-associated motor decline in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 22‑month longitudinal experiment was conducted to examine the effects of life‑long oral nicotine exposure in mice. Moderate or high doses of highly purified nicotine were added to drinking water to mimic plasma concentrations in human smokers but without combustion byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotine’s systemic effects on aging were mapped through high‑precision three-dimensional (3D) behavioral tracking, multi‑organ metabolomics, gut microbiota sequencing, and cell‑based assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that nicotine reprograms aging‑associated metabolism in a dose‑dependent manner, particularly through glycolipid and sphingolipid pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide availability, limited ceramide accumulation, and improved energy homeostasis, which are molecular adaptations that correlated with delayed motor decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal gut microbiota analysis revealed preserved microbial diversity and the enrichment of sphingolipid‑related metabolites linked to sarcopenia prevention. By integrating behavioral and metabolic profiles, researchers developed a “Behavior‑Metabolome Age” score, and confirmed that nicotine‑treated mice displayed a biologically younger phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first systemic mapping of nicotine‑driven metabolic remodeling during natural aging, and identifies a gut-sphingolipid-energy axis underlying motor function resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes a life‑long, dose‑dependent assessment of nicotine’s systemic impact, integrates AI-based 3D behavioral and multi‑omics data to quantify biological aging, and provides insight into sphingolipid‑mediated neuromuscular protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that while oral nicotine in this controlled paradigm avoids combustion‑related toxicants and may pose lower systemic risks than conventional tobacco products, its long‑term safety and complex biological effects warrant careful evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides a mechanistic framework to evaluate long‑term nicotine exposure and inspires the development of “non‑addictive cholinergic metabolic modulators” aimed at sustaining mobility and metabolic health in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on years of expertise in metabolism, neurobiology, and inhalable materials, the research team will continue making systematic, forward‑looking research to uncover the scientific basis and potential value of nicotine as well as novel aerosolized compounds in aging intervention and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging, nicotine, and motor decline research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0170746f2f6d7441726860752f60622f626f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Qun LU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://siat.ac.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SIAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Qun LU – SIAT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202415311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nicotine Reprograms Aging-Related Metabolism and Protects Against Motor Decline in Mice&lt;/a&gt;” by LIU Xin’an et al. &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicotine Reprograms Aging-Related Metabolism and Protects Against Motor Decline in Mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of nicotine on aging-related motor and cognitive decline remain controversial due to limited empirical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, mice are permitted to orally consume nicotine over a 22-month period and observed attenuated motor decline without pathological alterations in major metabolism-related peripheral organs or immune system dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-organ metabolomic profiling and network analysis of aged mice (24 months old) identified nicotine-responsive pathways related to glycolipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic gut microbiota profiling via series expression miner-based longitudinal analysis reveals that nicotine consumption preserved microbiota composition and altered microbial-derived metabolites associated with the sphingolipid pathway, known to regulate age-related muscle dysfunction and sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assays in aged mice and C2C12 cells confirmed that nicotine regulates sphingolipid turnover, particularly via sphingomyelin synthases and neutral sphingomyelinases, to enhance nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide availability and energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These metabolic adaptations correlated with reduced ceramide accumulation and improved motor function. Behavior-Metabolome Age (BMAge) score confirmed a biologically younger phenotype in the nicotine-treated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that life-long oral nicotine consumption reprograms aging-associated metabolism through regulation of systemic sphingolipid homeostasis, conferring resilience against age-related motor decline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:01:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE4tZnBEVElWRE1jZFJoc2xSaFpzZzZKMEJUSnlTT0dQOXJPdWlJaEl6a1I2Vi1yVjFTWEZWV0tVeWU1cGZ1ZUwwc0xjY283NHgxanBVSnVlU3oxanNmREltRGlpUmVsRDRvR0VOZnhSam1wUQ</guid></item><item><title>这些加工食品正在秘密破坏您的饮食- GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQRTFiSV93QWdnZTBNTXVqRzJuamdzQjNISkF5MV94Qm00MmM1RkdPRTNGQjNCXzJ3Uy1kdWdtaGtKYnpkNDQzdGxKdXhzRFdybEJLeUpTTktxd1YwU2QxQjVZcEhibUxqRzFxR2haQVhoa25yWDB4ZGRTVjM2SVR4dnZjM2FqYTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dicken says that it’s important to consider how ultra-processed foods (especially health-branded ones) are being used in someone’s diet. He uses protein bars as an example. If someone is eating a protein bar instead of a candy bar, he says that’s a beneficial switch even though they are both ultra-processed foods. But if they’re eating a protein bar instead of protein-rich whole foods like nuts or eggs, that’s not as optimal. In other words, it depends on what one’s overall diet is like and the role ultra-processed foods are playing in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods to minimize—and what to eat instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind, we’ve put together a guide to identifying common ultra-processed foods in your diet (you’ll be surprised at what some of them are) and replacing them with healthier, less processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Breakfast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unexpected sabotagers:&lt;/strong&gt; Protein bars, instant oatmeal, flavored yogurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replacements:&lt;/strong&gt; Eggs, nuts, seeds, rolled oats, plain yogurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-protein-bars-nutrition"&gt;Protein bars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-protein-powder-muscle-gain"&gt;powders&lt;/a&gt; can be a great supplement in a pinch, or a horrible excuse for a meal replacement,” says registered dietitian and clinical exercise physiologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://jonlanman.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://jonlanman.com/"}' href="https://jonlanman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Lanman, MS, RD, CEP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing Dr. Dicken’s earlier point, he says that it comes down to why you are using them. “If you’re rushing to the gym after work and haven’t eaten in hours, a protein shake or bar can save the day. But if it’s replacing a balanced meal, you’re missing out on a lot of other benefits like fiber, healthy fats, and other vitamins and phytonutrients,” Lanman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a protein bar is your go-to breakfast, Lanman and Dr. Landry both recommend replacing it with whole foods that are naturally high in protein, like eggs and Greek yogurt (which is minimally processed as opposed to ultra-processed). “When you do reach for a protein bar or powder, check the label. Aim for at least 10 grams of protein, minimal added sugar, and a short list of recognizable ingredients,” Lanman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another secretly processed breakfast food? Instant oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oatmeal has a lot of benefits,” Lanman says. “For example, it’s high in a particular type of fiber called beta-glucan that can help reduce cholesterol. But instant oatmeal packets are one of the worst breakfast items. They market themselves using the health benefits of oatmeal, but they are typically full of sugar, and have no balance between carbs, fat, and protein. That means it won’t stick with you for very long. They tend to spike your blood sugar, then cause you to crash soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, go for rolled oats over instant oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lanman says that flavored yogurt is also sneakily ultra-processed. While it does have protein, calcium, and probiotics, he says that yogurts are also often full of sugar. Instead, he recommends opting for plain yogurt and sweetening it with less processed ingredients like berries and honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Lunch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unexpected sabotagers:&lt;/strong&gt; Deli meat, refined breads, bottled salad dressings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replacements:&lt;/strong&gt; Chicken, ready-to-eat fish, whole grain bread, homemade salad dressing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQRTFiSV93QWdnZTBNTXVqRzJuamdzQjNISkF5MV94Qm00MmM1RkdPRTNGQjNCXzJ3Uy1kdWdtaGtKYnpkNDQzdGxKdXhzRFdybEJLeUpTTktxd1YwU2QxQjVZcEhibUxqRzFxR2haQVhoa25yWDB4ZGRTVjM2SVR4dnZjM2FqYTA</guid></item><item><title>医生警告说，在即将到来的季节，鲜为人知的流感并发症对某些人来说可能是致命的-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOZ0Y3bVR3RHhpeUFKOHpGRUtfbm92aThwakJhc0M5azIxSkFCUEFYUE1DSU9MUG9RanpVTE44QVZ2cU8yWjlxMFBtZVN6emhmMVJmLUhza3BSWmh0U2tEVkoxb2tzcXZ0ZF9YcUhYRGhtcWxOb1NEWHJUbFhqVHphbXFacGVlR0ZxcFRfQlMzUzJpeDdOMkhHV9IBngFBVV95cUxON1I3bHpUeklFcDhNTFp4VEhVTnhvX2padVRRcGIwR1VNenRnZGZvX2lPRUQ5a2k3cHJWY3FxU1NDaW9nZC1ESlgxUU1KVDRBSVFOT1UtSlFzVXk2bXVPNkpZQzZuSkpTbjhpb3ZUUkZPdldRQVZsT0x1bzdhNGVTcG56bDd2LWVyOEZlT01mMWFuYmdIWGpTbHItcUlaZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="author-section byline-plain"&gt;By LUKE ANDREWS U.S. SENIOR HEALTH REPORTER &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ahead of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-cd23bb60-7ea5-11f0-bbaa-dd5d27877689"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; season, parents are being warned that healthy children could develop a life-threatening condition after being infected with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 6million children are infected with flu every year.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Dragolea, a primary care physician in the UK who was not involved in the research, told DailyMail.com: 'I see a lot of adults and children with flu every winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is one of those extremely rare but extremely serious complications that happens predominantly in children.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes ahead of then next flu season, which typically begins in October. Up to 40million Americans are infected with the disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is caused by an overreaction from the immune system to a viral infection, most commonly the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This triggers high levels of inflammation in the body that disrupts the blood-brain barrier and causes damage and swelling in brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients initially suffer from congestion, a cough, diarrhea or fever, but within days they develop fainting, seizures, trouble breathing and difficulty with movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment involves anti-viral medications to kill the virus and steroids or anti-inflammatory drugs to calm the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study published in JAMA, researchers contacted 76 academic organizations across the US to ask members to submit reports of cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Millions of children catch flu every year and most recover without needing medical care (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They received reports of 41 cases detected between October 2023 and May 2025 from 23 hospitals nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients had an average age of five years old, and three out of four were considered to be healthy and had no previous health conditions. Twenty-three of the patients were female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the group, 38 developed a sudden onset of fever, while 41 patients had encephalopathy, or swelling in the brain, and 28 suffered from seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eleven of the patients died, or 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those who were hospitalized, they were on wards for between 11 and 22 days before being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 38 patients with vaccination history, six were vaccinated against the disease, equivalent to 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children are more at risk from the disease because their immune systems are still developing and may overreact to a virus, causing the complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older people and those with weaker immune systems are also more at risk, as their weaker immune systems raise the risk of an infection that could then cause an overreaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It isn't clear why there may have been an uptick in cases, but doctors say this could be linked to lockdowns which led to children receiving fewer exposures to 'good microbes' which can cause their immune systems to overreact to other infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-968211f0-7e9c-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; raised the alarm over the condition in March, saying a dozen children had contracted the rare brain disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a report, it said of the 68 children who died of the flu during the 2024 to 2025 season, nine had encephalopathy and four had acute necrotizing encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The answer isn't as straightforward or as much of a consensus as it used to be: In an unusual move, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommending;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; a different approach to childhood vaccination than the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups agree that families should make individual decisions in consultation with their doctors about whether kids should be vaccinated. But the AAP has a stricter stance for the youngest eligible children in the U.S., recommending that all of them get COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://time.com/7288915/cdc-covid-19-vaccines-pregnant-women-children/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stopped recommending;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stopped recommending&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children older than six months following &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guidance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in May. The CDC does, however, recommend the shot for children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after the AAP released its recommendations, Kennedy fired back at the organization on &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1957914911415153107?s=46&amp;amp;t=9AHxthXdGRIl37bvHR6MCg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:social media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, accusing them of allowing pharmaceutical-company donors to guide their recommendations. AAP maintains that its recommendations are based on science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the clashing advice regarding COVID-19 vaccines for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the AAP recommend in terms of COVID-19 shots for children?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether most children should get a COVID-19 vaccine should be based on their particular risk, the AAP says—taking into account their underlying conditions, such as asthma, obesity, or diabetes, as well as whether they live in a household with people at high risk for developing severe disease. That risk is higher for the youngest eligible age group—ages 6 months to 23 months—which is why the AAP recommends that all kids in this age group get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the youngest kids, the hospitalization rate is similar to that for adults 50 to 64 years old,” says Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. “It’s not nothing. And that’s for something that can be prevented by a vaccine, which has been better studied than any medical product in our history. We have a very strong level of confidence in the safety of the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to TIME's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are the recommendations different?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the CDC sets the schedule for which vaccines people should get and at which ages. The CDC makes its decision based on advice from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is made up of independent experts who volunteer to review data, discuss their findings, and make recommendations to help guide the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy—a longtime vaccine-skeptic who now oversees the CDC as head of HHS—&lt;a href="https://time.com/7292553/rfk-jr-removes-cdc-vaccine-committee-experts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fired;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all members of ACIP in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:June;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, accusing them of following industry interests. Kennedy replaced them days later with people he had selected, “many of them with strong anti-vaccine views,” says O’Leary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://time.com/7278169/baby-screenings-newborn-changing-trump-administration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Having a Baby Is Changing Under Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Having a Baby Is Changing Under Trump&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ACIP was replaced, AAP—which typically works closely with the advisory committee and other liaison groups in setting vaccination schedules—decided not to attend ACIP’s first meeting under the new administration in the spring. “We saw from that meeting that ACIP has gone off the rails, essentially, in terms of the way they are operating and the messaging from the new members, which is very much around sowing distrust about vaccines and not making evidence-based vaccine recommendations,” says O’Leary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the AAP and other liaison groups were asked to discontinue their participation in ACIP work groups, O’Leary says. “We received an email un-inviting us,” he says. The reason provided, he says, was that the organizations represented “special interest groups,” which O’Leary says is a “poor interpretation of the rules. All of the organizations at the table have expertise, and there are a lot of reasons to have representation from professional societies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which advice will doctors and pharmacists follow?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Leary says pediatricians are anticipating having to have more conversations with families about the conflicting vaccine advice, and that the AAP is providing guidance to help inform those discussions on its website and via emails to its members. “Politics has entered the exam room in a way that it never has before,” he says. “These discussions will be contextual, depending on how well the pediatrician knows the family, what relationship they have, and how frank they can be with them in the discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he says, the message from pediatricians should be this: “We are committed to the health of children, and our recommendations are based on the best available science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7287451/fda-new-covid-19-vaccine-guidance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What the New COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance Means For You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What the New COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance Means For You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists must take a slightly different approach, since they are only allowed to vaccinate according to the CDC’s recommendations, while doctors can vaccinate outside of strictly approved conditions or populations in so-called “off-label” use. Since current CDC recommendations say that families should make their own decisions about whether their children receive the shot, pharmacists will vaccinate kids if parents want them to have the shots, but won’t specifically recommend that people get them. “Our guidance is to always follow what the CDC or HHS recommends,” says Rick Gates, chief pharmacy officer at Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If families come in with questions about whether their child should get the COVID-19 shot, pharmacists will probably refer them back to their pediatrician or family physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will insurance cover COVID-19 vaccines for kids if the CDC doesn’t recommend them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still not clear how insurers will respond to the differing recommendations. “This is a real concern,” says Dr. David Higgins, an infectious-disease expert at AAP. Traditionally, a recommendation from ACIP means that a shot will be covered, since any vaccines recommended by the committee have to be reimbursed by insurers under the Affordable Care Act.

Experts have warned that an outbreak is likely this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These insects multiply in warm weather, which is why more deer are affected during the summer months. Americans should expect to see more cases in areas where deer live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by a virus that spreads between deer, and experts have warned of a possible outbreak this summer. The insects that carry the disease reproduce in warm weather, which is why more deer develop warts during summer. As a result, Americans can expect to see more cases wherever deer live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Papillomas are most frequently seen during the late summer and into the fall, probably due to increased biting insect activity during this time of year,” &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#:~:text=Papilloma%20viruses%20may%20be%20transferred,during%20this%20time%20of%20year." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/lumps-growths-washington-deer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;FOX13&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; while there aren’t any known cases of people contracting plague from deer, there are other situations where a human got it from other animals like prairie dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The chances of that happening are pretty rare, but not zero,” Dr. Elis Fisk, Washington State University Anatomic Pathology Resident, tells &lt;em&gt;FOX13&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_809743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-809743" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/08/bunny-eeerie-grotesque-growth-800x420.jpg" alt="Two wild rabbits are shown: the left one in dry grass with a mass of black spiky objects on its face, and the right one in snow with a dark mass hanging from its mouth.

&lt;p&gt;El Dorado County’s public health division announced the positive plague case on Tuesday and stated that the individual is currently under the care of a medical professional while recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,” Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s acting director of public health, said in &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other information about the person or their condition was released but health officials said they are investigating the situation.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, and plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bites of fleas that have acquired them from infected squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents, according to El Dorado County’s public health division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into people’s homes and warn that people can get the disease when they are bitten by infected fleas. Plague can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild rodents and keeping pets away from rodent burrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_7184442_68a748c8ccf25" data-displayinline-video-id="7184442" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/7184442/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_7184442_68a748c8ccf25" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague, which spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs. Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is rare in humans, with an average of about seven cases reported annually in the U.S., most of them in the western states, according to federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the current case, the most recently reported case of human plague in El Dorado County was in 2020, and the person was likely exposed in the South Lake Tahoe area. Two people were also reported to have plague in 2015 after being exposed to infected rodents or fleas in Yosemite National Park. Both individuals were treated and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from pneumonic plague. The death in Coconino County was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague since 2007, local officials said. Further details, including the identity of the victim, were not released.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Conducting a clinical trial would be a big next step and could help us understand if omega-3s and omega-6s obtained from diet could help lower risk of EDS.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aged cheeses include &lt;span&gt;cheddar, feta, parmesan and brie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salami, sausage, bacon, pepperoni and mortadella, meanwhile, are all classed as cured and processed meat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeast-extract spreads include Marmite and Vegemite, while overripe bananas and avocadoes are common examples of d&lt;/span&gt;ried and overripe fruits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14831637/Nap-daytime-sleeping-early-death-dementia.html"&gt;research published in June&lt;/a&gt; found that daytime napping may be linked to an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US scientists, who tracked more than 86,000 healthy middle-aged adults, discovered those who regularly napped—particularly in the early afternoon—were more likely to die prematurely than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say daytime sleepiness may be a warning sign of disrupted or poor-quality night-time rest and could point to underlying health problems such as sleep disorders, dementia, or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They are currently used to treat a number of conditions including heart failure, high blood pressure and sometimes anxiety &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Michelle Halls, senior author of the study and an expert in drug discovery biology at Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, said the findings were exciting as they confirmed the potential link between beta blockers and tumour progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our colleagues previously found that beta blockers are associated with a significant reduction in mortality in people with triple negative breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now we have a much better grasp on why this could be the case,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Terrance Lam, a pharmaceutical PhD candidate at the institute and co-author, added: 'Our collective research strongly suggests that HOXC12 is a potential new indicator for when triple negative breast cancer patients could respond to beta blocker targeted interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive cancer which can be especially challenging to treat and identifying new treatment pathways are important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are now calling for further studies to 'urgently' determine whether the gene can be used at diagnosis to identify patients who will benefit from beta blocker therapy—and stop their cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beta blockers, commonly prescribed to lower blood pressure, work mainly by slowing the heart and blocking the action of stress hormones such as adrenaline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study, published in Science Signaling, there is a strong correlation between activation of the beta-2 adrenoceptor and accelerated cancer spread.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that patients with high levels of HOXC12 expression in women with this form of cancer were associated with poorer overall survival outcomes .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in seven women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime—around 56,000 a year—making it the most common cancer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 per cent of women diagnosed with breast cancer survive for more than five years following their diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, triple negative breast cancer—which accounts for around 15 per cent of all breast cancers in the UK and US—is far more challenging to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, it grows and spreads faster than other breast cancer types and has fewer treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One reason for this is because it doesn't interact with hormones such as oestrogen in the same way as other breast cancers—for which there are targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average around 77 per cent of women with triple negative breast cancer will survive their cancer for five years or more after they are diagnosed, but depending on the stage this can fall as low as 12 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is compared to around 90 per cent of women with other forms of breast cancer who will survive for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But while the pandemic certainly contributed to a spike in deaths, expectations of a return to pre-pandemic mortality rates were smashed as number crunchers noticed a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/4354004-this-is-bigger-than-covid-why-are-so-many-americans-dying-early/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;larger trend&lt;/a&gt; that was decades in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmingly, the data trickling in was indicating a disproportionate rise in deaths among &lt;a href="https://www.soa.org/4ac0fd/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2023/group-life-covid-mort-06-23.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;young Americans aged 25 to 44&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing millennials and some older members of gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question then was whether lingering complications due to COVID were to blame. Now, two years later, millennial and late-gen Z aged Americans continue to shuffle off the mortal coil in higher and higher numbers — even as deaths among other age groups return to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent essay by &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/millennials-gen-z-death-rates-america-high.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;mortality experts for &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/millennials-gen-z-death-rates-america-high.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;examined the grim trend, which the insurance industry dubs "excess mortality" — the number of actual recorded deaths compared to the expected figure — in light of recent data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2010, the authors write, life expectancy for the average millennial-aged adult in America had been ticking steadily upward, thanks to a drop-off in deaths from diseases like HIV and cancer, homicide, and cardiovascular disease. After 2010, however, this trend began to stall, as drug overdoses, vehicular accidents, and gastrointestinal disease wiped out previous life expectancy gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Americans in general die at a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10030346/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;much higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than residents of other high-income countries, the rise excess mortality among millennials still manages to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the experts write for &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;, about 50 percent of the deaths among Americans under 65 wouldn't have happened if those unfortunate souls lived in another country. For those young adults aged 25 to 44, that number becomes a whopping 62 percent, or two out of every three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of rising excess mortality among millennials is still debated, and likely can't be blamed on a single issue. However, while life expectancy has fluctuated through the years, we do know that the number of excess deaths in the US has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834281" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;risen steadily&lt;/a&gt; among all age groups since 1980 — the year of US President Ronald Reagan's &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-1980" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;landslide electoral victory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might not be a coincidence, as the millennial death drive likely has its roots in a number of Reagan-era &lt;a href="https://www.smu.edu/news/archives/2009/ravi-batra-srilanka-23march2009" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;political decisions&lt;/a&gt; made to siphon money to the ultra-rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the economic policies enacted by Reagan and his &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-policy-history/article/abs/reagans-southern-comfort-the-boll-weevil-democrats-in-the-reagan-revolution-of-1981/9CD3104050E530F9827D7527B0D591A5" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;ideological majority&lt;/a&gt; in Congress, the US has gradually decimated its &lt;a href="https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/focus/pdfs/foc52b.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;social safety net&lt;/a&gt;, empowered &lt;a href="https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/thom-hartmann/free-market-lies-reaganomics-expanded-inequality-crushed-stability-working-families/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;corporate interests&lt;/a&gt; over public welfare, and prioritized &lt;a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/05/greg-grandin-empires-workshop-latin-america" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;devastating military interventions&lt;/a&gt; throughout the global south at the expense of workers' rights, public services, and economic equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Reagan is now long deceased, his policies are now firmly entrenched as the &lt;a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/04/neoliberalism-biden-trump-keynesianism-bailouts-capitalism-democracy" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;status quo&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in many of the issues faced by young Americans today, such as &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/01/09/economic-inequality-seen-as-major-challenge-around-the-world/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;rising economic inequality&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953624002958" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;crumbling healthcare system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without stable jobs, healthcare, affordable housing, quality food, and physical connection to their communities, this rising mortality rate is unlikely to change barring a substantial reorganization of economic policy.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A low-FODMAP diet involves cutting down on sugars, refined starchy carbohydrates and dairy products which can promote fermentation in the gut and opting for low-FODMAP alternatives &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Removing high FODMAP foods can give your gut lining a chance to repair itself and restore a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria, easing symptoms of IBS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best low-FODMAP alternatives include non-fermentable vegetables such as aubergines and potatoes, low-fructose fruits like grapes, kiwis and oranges and protein-rich eggs, tofu and seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1615671/full"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;researchers at the Haukeland University Hospital, Norway, investigated the impact of a low FODMAP diet on levels of GLP-1—a hormone released in the gut after eating that has been linked with IBS—in patients with the painful condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers studied 30 adult patients with mixed type IBS—when sufferers tend to experience alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-97962260-7e8e-11f0-ab9a-e36032aef9e7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15021193/diet-cure-IBS-indigestion-fodmap-gut-glp.html"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8197882/best-recipes-gut-health" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is crucial to overall health, and enjoying fermented foods is a great way to help boost the good gut bacteria in your intestines, says Lauren DeDecker, doctor, personal trainer, health coach, and nutritionist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitian Lauren Manaker explains that a healthy gut microbiome plays a major role in digestion, immune function, and even potentially mood. “Fermented foods may also help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-anti-inflammatory-foods-11716890" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, improve nutrient absorption, and support overall gut health,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why are fermented foods so powerful? Fermentation acts like a form of “pre-digestion,” where the beneficial bacteria break down proteins and carbohydrates, making nutrients more bioavailable, explains Matthew Landry, assistant professor of population health and disease prevention at UC Irvine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; How Much and How Often? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our experts agree that to get the most benefits out of fermented foods, consistency is key. “A small serving, such as a few tablespoons of sauerkraut or kimchi, a cup of yogurt, or a glass of kefir, most days of the week can be enough to support gut health,” says Manaker. It’s unlikely that having a serving of fermented foods every once in a blue moon will result in a profoundly positive impact on your overall health. Even so, anything is better than nothing—even small amounts can make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeDecker says that if a product lists how many CFUs (colony-forming units) of probiotics it contains, you can aim for products that have higher CFUs to get "more bang for your buck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-yogurt-and-skyr"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Yogurt and Skyr &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of DeDecker’s favorite fermented foods is yogurt—she tries to eat a serving of Greek yogurt every day. A serving of Greek yogurt can contain between 10 and 20 billion CFUs. Manaker leans toward Icelandic skyr. This option still has plenty of probiotic cultures, with the added benefit of having a bit more protein than yogurt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy yogurt or skyr for breakfast with fresh fruit, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/344488/granola" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;granola&lt;/a&gt;, and nuts, or use them in a &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1157454/summer-waldorf-yogurt-tarragon-dressing" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;creamy salad dressing&lt;/a&gt; instead of mayonnaise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Manaker and Landry share a favorite way to incorporate fermented products into their daily diet—a glass of kefir. It’s a great option, says Manaker, because it is loaded with a wide variety of probiotic strains so that a single glass can go a long way. She notes some brands also make kefir-esque “shots” to make it easy to include these strains in your day in small quantities. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;Manaker likes to sip kefir straight; Landry often blends it into a smoothie with fiber-rich fruits and/or leafy greens. Or, turn it into a fun &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1554991/berry-banana-kefir-bowl" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothie bowl&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If yogurt or kefir isn’t your thing, cottage cheese is another great option, especially for breakfast. It boasts a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/high-protein-foods-11704587" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high level of protein&lt;/a&gt;, making it a great way to start your day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;Cottage cheese can swing sweet or savory. Keep it sweet by adding some fiber-rich berries, granola, and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, or pile it onto toasts as you would do with ricotta. You can even use it in place of liquids like milk or yogurt in &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/315416/cottage-cheese-pancakes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pancakes&lt;/a&gt;. Lean into a savory palate by serving it alongside your favorite roasted vegetables, a fried or poached egg, and a generous drizzle of hot sauce (bonus points if it’s a fermented hot sauce).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fermentation in &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-miso-8769132" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;miso&lt;/a&gt; is what gives it its umami-rich power. The longer the miso is fermented, the darker the color–that’s why you can purchase it in a variety of colors, from red to white. According to Manaker, miso is concentrated with probiotics, so even a small amount can pack a nutritional punch. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;DeDecker likes to whisk a spoonful into savory salad dressings. Try incorporating miso into marinades, pan sauces, &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/316804/miso-glazed-cod" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glazes for fish&lt;/a&gt; and meat, and soups for an added probiotic boost.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kimchi is Landry's favorite fermented food because it’s so versatile, ”plus you get the benefit of added fiber and nutrients from the vegetables themselves.” It is most commonly made with Napa cabbage and daikon radish and flavored with seasonings like ginger, garlic, and gochugaru. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;Manaker recommends adding a scoop of kimchi to scrambled eggs to give them a tangy kick. Landry adds a spoonful to rice bowls and sandwiches or mixes it in with grilled vegetables. He often serves it as a side dish, too.
&lt;/p&gt;

It is also made with cabbage, but the seasonings are usually just salt. It has a crunchy texture and sour flavor, similar to that of kimchi. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;DeDecker likes to toss a scoop of sauerkraut into salads and grain bowls or just eat it as a fermented vegetable starter. Pile it onto avocado toast or serve it alongside fatty fish or lean meats to brighten them up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think of tempeh as tofu’s ultra-fermented cousin. It’s also made from soybeans, but fermenting the beans results in a dense block with a slightly funky flavor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;Manaker uses tempeh in place of bacon to make a vegan BLT sandwich. Other than that, you can &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8366916/how-to-cook-tofu" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;use it just about anywhere you would use firm or extra-firm tofu&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_77-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all pickles are created equal (the same is true for sauerkraut). That is, not all pickles are fermented. DeDecker says that you’ll find the fermented version in the refrigerated section, rather than on the shelves with other dry ingredients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_78-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_79-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;How to eat: &lt;/strong&gt;Big or small, crunchy pickles are perfect for snacking or layering with other fun ingredients on your favorite sandwiches.

					&lt;p&gt;When done right, snacking can be healthy and help curb your appetite in between meals, but what you snack on matters. Filling up in junk obviously isn’t great for your overall well-being or weight management goals, but even when you think you’re eating healthy snacks, sometimes that isn’t enough to boost your nutrition and energy. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/violeta-morris?utm_source=gmb&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic" target="_blank"&gt;Violeta Morris&lt;/a&gt; is an MS, RDN from Columbus, OH, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://conciergedietitianvioleta/" target="_blank"&gt;The Concierge Dietitian&lt;/a&gt; and knows a thing or two about proper snacking but realized she wasn’t getting the full health benefits with her daily snack of fruit. After switching up her snack routine, Morris not only gained more nutrients, but reduced belly fat. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunger is not only uncomfortable, but a distraction from daily tasks, which is where snacking comes in. “Snacking is important because it helps maintain steady energy levels throughout the day without relying solely on large meals,” says Morris.  “It can prevent major swings in blood sugar and keep hunger from building too much between meals, which reduces the likelihood of overeating later in the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snacking is supposed to help eliminate cravings and tide you over until your next meal, but it can often go in the wrong direction. “Snacking often goes wrong when it is unplanned, too frequent, or made up of foods that are high in refined carbohydrates or saturated fats,” says Morris. “These types of snacks can add unnecessary calories and cause blood sugar to spike quickly, leading to a crash that results in increased hunger, cravings, and changes in mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruit is touted as a healthy go-to snack, but there are things to be mindful of. “I used to snack too often on fruit alone, such as a banana or a bowl of watermelon,” says Morris. “While fruit is nutrient-rich, I noticed—through wearing a continuous glucose monitor—that my blood sugar would spike soon after eating it by itself.” She explains, “Although I do not have diabetes, I realized that glucose levels affect how everyone feels. As a dietitian, I support eating fruit for its antioxidants and nutrients, but I recommend consuming it after a meal or pairing it with protein or healthy fat to minimize spikes.

&lt;p&gt;Being strategic about how and when she ate fruit gave Morris the upperhand with snacking. “I didn’t eliminate fruit entirely, instead, I paired it with a handful of Brazil nuts or almonds before eating the fruit,” she explains. “This gave me the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants from the fruit while also adding protein and healthy fats from the nuts.” She adds, “This combination made the snack more balanced and helped prevent blood sugar spikes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By being intentional with snacks—aiming for at least 10 grams of protein along with fiber and healthy fats—I stayed full longer and avoided rapid glucose spikes,”Morris says. “Limiting these spikes reduces the number of times insulin is released throughout the day, which can help the body reduce belly fat and overall weight over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broccoli and Brussels sprouts that often get pushed to the edge of the plate might aid in reducing the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer (CC) claimed &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-23712-1" target="_blank"&gt;903,859 lives in 2022&lt;/a&gt; alone. It stands as the world's third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with roughly 1.9 million new diagnoses each year. Among the many factors that shape CC risk, diet is one of the most powerful and, importantly, the one we can control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent systematic review found that people who consumed more cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower or Brussels sprouts, had a 20% lower risk of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colon+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared to those who consumed less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from over 17 studies, comprising a total participant pool of 639,539, with 97,595 cases of colon cancer. Including 20–40 grams of cruciferous veggies has the best protective effect per gram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is &lt;a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-025-04163-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;BMC Gastroenterology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being a rich source of beneficial phytochemicals, including flavonoids, fiber, vitamin C, and carotenoids, cruciferous vegetables are also packed with glucosinolates. When chewed, these compounds break down into bioactive isothiocyanates, particularly sulforaphane (SFN)—a molecule responsible not only for the vegetables' strong, distinct odor but also for their protective, chemopreventive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isothiocyanates exhibit their cancer-protective role through multiple mechanisms: they can block enzymes that activate carcinogens, trigger apoptosis (programmed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell death&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/malignant+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;malignant cells&lt;/a&gt;, inhibit the formation of new blood vessels at tumor sites, and arrest the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+cycle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell cycle&lt;/a&gt;, thereby preventing uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that the sweet spot where the protective effect of eating the veggies started to appear was at around 20 grams a day. The greatest risk reduction per gram was observed between 20 and 40 grams, but no significant improvement was seen beyond 40 grams per day. The protective effect plateaued between 40 and 60 grams, with no additional benefits above this range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that geography may play a role in determining the extent of the protective effect. The team found that the protective effect was particularly noticeable in studies from North America and Asia, but less clear in Europe or Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that while this study suggests a promising inverse relationship between higher intake of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cruciferous+vegetables/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cruciferous vegetables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colon/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; cancer incidence, the findings should be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methodological limitations such as differences in study design and variations in dietary assessment make it necessary to recognize the caveats that accompany the results.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the first West Nile Virus-related death in Kent County in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes carrying West Nile Virus have been captured in mosquito traps across Kent County, including in an area just 3,000 feet from where the person lived. The health department did not disclose where in the county the individual lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our deepest condolences go out to the family and loved ones of this individual," said Brendan Earl, Supervising Sanitarian at the Kent County Health Department. "This tragic outcome is a reminder that mosquitoes in our area are active and capable of spreading serious illness. Prevention remains our best protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile Virus is the top disease carried by mosquitoes, per the health department. Most people develop no symptoms; roughly one out of five people will experience flu-like symptoms; and one out of 150 become severely ill with impacts to the central nervous system, sometimes resulting in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccine for West Nile Virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend using insect repellent with at least 10 percent DEET, wearing long sleeves and pants, staying indoors at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, and draining any bodies of standing water near your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow FOX 17:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.facebook.com/fox17online/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a class="Link" href="https://twitter.com/FOX17"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.instagram.com/fox17online/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wxmi"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned that low doses of ionizing radiation could increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171752" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, at an individual level, the theoretical risk of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very low&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all. Patients should not hesitate to undergo these tests if they are considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed annually in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-viral-cause-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-common-cancers"&gt;Scientists Discover a Viral Cause of One of The World's Most Common Cancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in April, a team in the US and the UK predicted that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radioactive-waste-exposed-children-in-missouri-to-cancer-risks-study-finds"&gt;risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171762" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg" alt="A patient undergoing a CT scan, with a technician present" class="size-medium wp-image-171762" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The theoretical risks of CT scans must be weighed against the benefits.

              &lt;h1&gt;Phantom limb study rewires our understanding of the brain&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;NIH scientists and collaborators reveal the brain preserves its representation of lost limb in clinical study.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a href="/sites/default/files/2025-08/20250821-amputation.jpg" class="link--no-tag link--zoom-in"&gt;&lt;article class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-float-right"&gt;
  
      
  

            &lt;p class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-long-caption field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;During MRI scans, participants moved their hand (pre-amputation) or phantom hand (post-amputation), as well as their lips (both before and after). Brain maps of the hand (red) and lips (blue) are shown for two pre-amputation scans (pre1, pre2) and multiple post-amputation time points: 3 months, 6 months, and 1.5 years. The maps look the same at each time point demonstrating the stability of the brain’s body map after amputation.&lt;/p&gt;
      
            &lt;p class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Hunter Schone&lt;/p&gt;
      
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers found that the brain’s control center for a lost appendage can persist long after surgical amputation, which stands in stark contrast to longstanding theories about the brain’s ability to reorganize itself, also known as plasticity. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their colleagues examined human brain activity before and after arm amputation and found that the loss of a limb does not prompt a large-scale cerebral overhaul. Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience, &lt;/em&gt;this study offers new insight into the mysterious phantom limb syndrome and could help guide the development of neuroprosthetics and pain treatments for people with limb loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists from NIH and University College London acted on a unique window of opportunity, running MRI scans on three participants in the months prior to a planned amputation (performed for separate medical purposes) and then up to five years after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not often you get the chance to conduct a study like this one, so we wanted to be exceedingly thorough,” said co-author Chris Baker, Ph.D., of NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). “We approached our data from a variety of angles and all of our results tell a consistent story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different regions in the brain’s outermost layer, called the cortex, are responsible for managing specific body parts. A prevailing theory among neuroscientists has been that, when a body part is damaged or lost, the cortex will remap itself, with neighboring regions associated with intact body parts encroaching on the newly available real estate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For many decades, cortical remapping as a response to amputation has been a literal textbook example of brain plasticity,” Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This corner of neuroscience has not been without debate, however. One sticking point with this theory is the pervasive phantom limb syndrome, wherein a patient feels vivid, often painful, sensations in a now missing extremity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baker and his co-authors took this phenomenon as a hint that the brain may remember what it lost. To find out for sure, the researchers needed to do something unprecedented; compare individuals’ brain activity before and after their amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many years of actively searching for and screening patients that were already scheduled to undergo amputation, the researchers identified three participants who could help answer their questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twice before the planned arm amputations, the scientists scanned participants using a special type of MRI, called functional MRI, to map brain activity triggered by the tapping of individual fingers. In the months and years following the surgeries, the researchers conducted three follow-up scans on the participants as they attempted to perform the same tasks, now with their phantom limb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared brain activity in search of any major changes between pre- and post-amputation data, but it quickly became clear that there was little to no difference. Had the authors not already known when the data was collected, Baker explained, then they likely would not have been able to tell the difference between the brain maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis was not limited to human eyes, however. The authors found that a machine learning algorithm — trained to identify movements of the fingers from pre-amputation data —had no trouble distinguishing which phantom finger was being moved after amputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also learned that nearby brain circuits associated with lip and feet movement did not migrate into the phantom limb’s territory. Additional analyses comparing their data to scans of able-bodied controls, as well as to other studies entirely, only continued to bolster their initial impression; the brain’s representation of the lost limb endures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results potentially improve our understanding of how phantom limb syndrome manifests and suggest that standard phantom pain treatments — many of which assume cortical reorganization after limb loss — may be worth rethinking. According to the study’s lead author, Hunter Schone, Ph.D., who conducted this research while a graduate student at NIH, the findings could also be key in how we implement transformative brain-computer interface technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This study is a powerful reminder that even after limb loss, the brain holds onto the body, almost like it’s waiting to reconnect in some new way,” said Schone. “Now, rapidly developing brain-computer interface technologies can operate under the assumption that the brain's body map remains consistent over time. This allows us to move into the next frontier: accessing finer details of the hand map, like distinguishing the tip of the finger from the base, and restoring the rich, qualitative aspects of sensation, such as texture, shape and temperature.”&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt; NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures of the deer with strange clusters of blisters on their flesh have been uploaded to social media from across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubbles have been sprouting all over the animals' bodies - pulling them out of shape from their legs to their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past two months, wildlife watchers have documented unsettling cases in New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials were quick to identify the condition as deer cutaneous fibroma - better known as "deer warts".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by a virus that spreads between the deer - and experts have warned of an outbreak this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often spread by disease-carrying insects, like mosquitos and tics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pass on the virus by transferring the blood of infected animals into healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease-carrying insects breed in warm weather, which is why there are more wart-ridden deer in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said: "Papillomas are most frequently seen during the late summer and into the fall, probably due to increased biting insect activity during this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer are not the only mutated animals that have been startling Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6376889967112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="JZ81AsHszB"

the lesions or saliva on those that are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus affecting the deer is from the same broad family as one that can infect humans - known as papillomaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can suffer from similar growths on their skin if infected by the human version of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there isn't any danger of a person

Photo: Dr. James Roberts, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;KANSAS CITY —An adult with a laboratory-confirmed infection of Naegleria fowleri has died, according to a statement from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The patient died on Tuesday in a St. Louis area hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/index.html"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/a&gt; is a microscopic single-celled free-living ameba that can cause a rare deadly infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), also known as “brain-eating” infection. Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ameba is common and naturally present in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers and ponds; however, PAM is extremely rare. Between 1962 and 2024, there were 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the patient’s exposure is still under investigation by public health officials. While not confirmed, preliminary information implies the patient may have been water skiing at the Lake of the Ozarks days prior to becoming ill. Recreational water users should assume that Naegleria fowleri is present in warm freshwater across the United States; however, infection remains very rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No additional suspected cases of PAM are being investigated in Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a rare occurrence, people become infected by Naegleria fowleri when water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose from freshwater sources. The Naegleria fowleri ameba then travels up the nose to the brain where it damages the brain tissue. This infection cannot be spread from one person to another, and it cannot be contracted by swallowing contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can take actions to reduce the risk of infection by limiting the amount of water going up the nose. These actions could include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="list-disc pl-12 py-10"&gt;&lt;li id="0"&gt;Hold your nose shut, use nose clips, or keep your head above water when taking part in activities in bodies of warm freshwater, especially if you jump or dive into the water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="1"&gt;Avoid putting your head under the water in hot springs and other untreated thermal waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="2"&gt;Avoid water-related activities in warm freshwater during periods of high-water temperature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="3"&gt;Avoid digging in, or stirring up, the sediment while taking part in water-related activities in shallow, warm freshwater areas. Naegleria fowleri amebas are more likely to live in sediment at the bottom of lakes, ponds and rivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who experience the following symptoms after swimming in any warm body of water should contact their health care provider immediately as the disease progresses rapidly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="list-disc pl-12 py-10"&gt;&lt;li id="0"&gt;Severe headache.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="1"&gt;Fever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="2"&gt;Nausea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="3"&gt;Vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="4"&gt;Stiff neck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="5"&gt;Seizures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="6"&gt;Altered mental status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="7"&gt;Hallucinations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about recreational water safety in Missouri is available &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/safety/recreationalwater/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;on the DHSS website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Salina Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 11:03:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5YOTVxelFqV053NlZ4WkQ3eEZlZDJUTTU2N3kwcEN0ZnR1MWRZa3lLaDh4YkdIVElESWZTSEVqaV9qbGktbjEzQXBtc0NUMks5bURyQnBScmNWaVZZaWVYV2lmRlM4QkdvUXAyY3pIRGNpX1U</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，这1种恼人的疾病实际上可能有助于保护您免受新冠肺炎的侵害- HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOUkZyaUx2b3hSRlZMTWQtQ2Q5TDE2OHM2UF9FaHVvQXNabEwzTEVKY2ZQM21OamU2V1k1MURTeHItMGhiWjRXSXFlbmZfWkM5VzZLNEF3OWpXQW1Calh3S3Q0UWZ5b3oxcFFYeXZpVFRxUHNtbjY4cWtDZ0ZyakMxM1QxWkRFR05rQllpX1RNM201Q1HSAZgBQVVfeXFMT243Tk4zTWlqTThuak45dGpSVXBpX0ZBdUtNM2QzNHdMNTdjS0JGbkQ2MGtJRkpqWHJuSGh5WlNOYThHemFNZ3BXMFRSLVF3VHpnR2pHMDR2RUExS045WWpXbGcxRFBkdXdFUFRVOUFkanVjOWRGNl9pSmMwa3ZMX3lvN2NYaktxMFdnUkNEeEhJejdnazNoWG8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one wants to catch the common cold, but it’s certainly better than a &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a5cc6fe4b0a58e15425ec2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;

First, researchers tested nasal swabs, which can paint a partial picture of infection, but not a full one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always have to remember when we look at things like the levels of the COVID virus in a nasal swab ... that’s not the level of the virus in the lung or in the person’s body,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re using the nasal swab as a surrogate, a placeholder, a peek at what might be happening in the body, but it’s not a true picture of that, so we have to be a little cautious about interpreting it,” Ray added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, since nasal swabs were collected every two weeks, participants may have gotten sick and then recovered from viruses like COVID-19 and rhinovirus in that time frame. Meaning, there may have been infections and subsequent virus protections that weren’t accounted for by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This does not mean that you’re totally protected from COVID-19 if you’ve had a recent cold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, t&lt;span&gt;his is not reason enough to expose yourself to someone with a cold. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you didn’t get SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t mean you’re healthier,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having repeated infections and becoming more resistant to other viruses isn’t necessarily a good thing, Ray added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could develop asthma as a result of these infections, he noted, along with other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know in the long term whether this kind of immunity might be a good thing because you’re protected or whether it might have a downside as well,” Ray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing to note is, while this is exciting and interesting, the immune system and immune function is very complex, so I would hesitate to make any strong generalizations,” added Mieses Malchuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about your immune system and your virus exposure, you should talk to your doctor, Mieses Malchuk noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, there are things you can do that actually can protect you from getting COVID.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned a lot of things during the last few years, and we’re still learning, but there are recommendations for the use of vaccines that we should follow, and vaccines are still a safer way to gain immunity to a virus than infection with that virus,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Updated COVID shots for 2025-2026 are expected to be available soon.

The study refutes foundational knowledge in the field of neuroscience that losing a limb results in a drastic reorganization of this region, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn’t take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could lead to the development of better prosthetic devices, or improved treatments for pain in ‘phantom limbs’ — when people continue to sense the amputated limb. It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mapping cortical plasticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain’s map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. “They would say: ‘I can still feel the limb, I can still move individual fingers of a hand I haven’t had for decades,’” Schone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of the body before the surgery, and then after the amputation for up to five years. It is the first study to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before their amputations, participants performed various movements, such as tapping their fingers, pursing their lips and flexing their toes while inside an fMRI scanner that measured the activity in different parts of the brain. This allowed the researchers to create a cortical ‘map’ showing which regions sensed the hand. To test the idea that neighbouring neurons redistribute in the cortex after amputation, they also made maps of the adjacent cortical area — in this case, the part that processes sensations from the lips. The participants repeated this exercise several times after their amputation, tapping “with their phantom fingers”, says Schone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01312-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02686-5/d41586-025-02686-5_25418070.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Famous ‘homunculus’ brain map redrawn to include complex movements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the brain’s representation of the body was consistent after the arm was amputated. Even five years after surgery, the cortical map of the missing hand was still activated in the same way as before amputation. There was also no evidence that the cortical representation of the lips had shifted into the hand region following amputation — which is what previous studies suggested would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makin says their study is “the most decisive direct evidence” that the brain’s in-built body map remains stable after the loss of a limb. “It just goes against the foundational knowledge of the field,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Aging can bring changes to people's bodies, minds and relationships — changes that many are often not prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Erlene Rosowsky, a clinical psychologist who &lt;a href="https://erlenepsyd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;specializes in aging&lt;/a&gt;, says many people don't see these changes coming because society is obsessed with youth. The emphasis is on all things "anti-aging," she says — not the realities of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of ageism in society, which bolsters the illusion of control and avoiding it," Rosowsky says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But once people begin to experience some of the realities of aging, they may find that younger folks don't really get it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, my mom, then in her early 80s, was given a slate of knee exercises to do to keep her mobile. "I've realized I'll have to do these exercises for the rest of my life!" she announced. "I didn't know being old would be so much &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Aging was work? I'd never thought about it that way. Then I realized that if, like her, I'd never much enjoyed exercise to begin with, and someone told me I had to start a daily regimen when I was already stiff and in pain, I'd dread it too. But she applied herself and is still doing the exercises today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosowsky, who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;herself is 82, says it's not just that changes to health, cognitive abilities and mobility crop up as people age. One's sense of self often changes as people leave a longtime career and relationships alter as friends move away or die. But, she says, people can adjust. Rosowsky says her body "doesn't look the way I remember it because I'm an older person," but she doesn't get hung up on it. She used to love cross-country skiing but no longer takes to the trails. She retired from teaching at a university but still researches and writes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-83513" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Arielou Marcy is 86 and has weathered some major changes recently. She lives in Lynchburg, Va., and lost her husband of 62 years a couple of years ago. Living without him has been a huge adjustment. However, Marcy lives with one of her daughters, two dogs and four cats, and she says she also has good neighbors and friends. These humans and animals keep her motivated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The most aggravating change she deals with on a daily basis is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15837-scoliosis" target="_blank"&gt;scoliosis&lt;/a&gt; — curvature of the spine. Instead of standing upright, "I go east to west," says Marcy. The condition alters her gait, and sometimes it just hurts. "It's driving me nuts," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, she doesn't want scoliosis to define her life. She takes a few over-the-counter painkillers a day, goes to physical therapy twice a week and continues to attend the yoga classes she has been going to for years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also stays focused on the things she has, not those she lacks. "Be ever grateful for the things you can do," she says. "Don't keep thinking, 'Oh, I used to be able to do that.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says living with one of her children helps keep her positive. "I have purpose," she says, in being there for her daughter when she gets home from work and helping to keep the house and pets cared for. The two of them are close.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But adult child-older parent relationships can be riddled with exasperation on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It can be hard for adult children to understand what their parents are going through as they age, because they haven't gone through it themselves. Parents may feel that lack of empathy keenly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How adult children can help parents adjust to change&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosowsky says there are several ways adult children can help aging parents adjust to life's vicissitudes. This may involve an attitude tweak on the child's part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, slow down and listen, Rosowsky says. Listening is the most important thing an adult child can do for an older parent, but middle-aged offspring are busy and rushed. For anyone on a short visit, she says, why not ask your parent how you can best spend your time with them? And if a parent is struggling with a change to their health, for instance, she suggests saying something like, "I'm seeing this might be hard for you. Is that what you're feeling?" She says there is often a gap between what the adult child thinks a parent needs and what that parent feels they need.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another thing children may try to oversee is a parent's diet. Many people end up having to alter their diets as they get older. But there's a difference between helping a parent stay on track with a new regime and bludgeoning them with reminders. Rosowsky says by all means make sure Mom or Dad has the information they need about whatever they're supposed to consume and avoid. But if they keep returning to a bag of Cheetos, curb your exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As long as a parent is competent to make decisions, they're competent to make lousy decisions or decisions you wouldn't make," she says. She adds that the mission of the child is to keep their parent safe and healthy. The older adult, though, "doesn't want to be wrapped up." Rather, they want to maintain their sense of autonomy and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, Rosowsky says, ask your parent to tell stories. In some of her past work in nursing homes, she saw a lot of physically frail people receiving intimate care from staff — the kind of care that felt humiliating to the recipient. It was a big, unwelcome change to their daily existence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when the staff member asked the older adult to tell them a story about their life, it altered the dynamic. "The communication went much better," she says, as the older person wasn't a helpless resident being tended to. By telling a story, she says — by giving something — the older adult became an equal part of the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes knowing what "should" be done collides with the reality of what one actually gets around to doing. Arielou Marcy is resisting the pressure she feels to make changes to her longtime home — to purge the house of clutter because doing so will, she's told, make things easier for her children after she's gone.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Why should I get rid of all the things I love that I've had throughout my life?" she asks, pointing out an old rocking horse that used to belong to her husband as a child, a teacup from her grandmother and artwork made by her daughters, who are now in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Much of the time she's happy to adjust, she says. But sometimes, she's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Dr. Tim Cannon, an oncologist at Inova Schar Cancer in Fairfax, revealed a potential link between extreme endurance exercise and increased risk of advanced colon cancer in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago, Inova said in a news release this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several years ago, Dr. Cannon noticed a disturbing trend: multiple ultramarathoners under age 40 were presenting at Inova with advanced-stage colorectal cancer," the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He launched a prospective clinical study to investigate whether long-distance running could be associated with an elevated risk of developing colon cancer. Recruitment material was made with the assistance of the wives of two of the runners who died from colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The participant athletes were otherwise healthy and had no known genetic predisposition or inflammatory conditions,” Cannon said in the release. “Given that many runners describe bleeding after running, and runner’s colitis is understood to be related to colonic ischemia and recurrent inflammation, it made us wonder whether the intense physical stress of endurance training could be contributing to a higher likelihood of mutagenesis causing precancerous polyps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 100 participants between the ages of 35 and 50 who had completed at least five marathons or two ultramarathons and had never undergone a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with hereditary cancer syndromes or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded to isolate the potential impact of endurance exercise alone, Inova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent a screening colonoscopy as part of the study. Prior to the procedure, each also completed a questionnaire covering dietary habits, bowel history, and long-distance running patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All polyps discovered during colonoscopy were reviewed by a panel of gastroenterologists, pathologists and oncologists to determine if they met the criteria for advanced adenomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking, the release said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;15% of participants had advanced adenomas (pre-cancerous lesions), compared to the expected 1–2% in average-risk individuals in this age range.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;41% of participants had at least one adenoma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average age of participants was 42.5 years old – two and a half years below the recommended age for a first screening colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first prospective study we know of to explore whether exercise-induced intestinal stress, specifically bowel ischemia from long-distance running, might increase cancer risk,” Cannon said. “While the results don’t prove causation, they strongly suggest that intense endurance exercise could be a meaningful risk factor for colorectal cancer and warrants further study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted from October 2022 through December 2024 and received Institutional Review Board approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team now hopes these findings will spark discussion about earlier screening for high-risk athletes and lead to life-saving detection strategies," Inova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As you might have guessed, the summer group was blissfully happy, and the winter group did not enjoy their stroll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But they still showed the same cognitive benefit as the people that walked in June,” he said of the latter group. “For these cognitive benefits, it’s not about liking the interaction. It’s something deeper.

Where did that term come from? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s built off some earlier research where people did studies on rodents and found out that when rodents lived in rich environments that had toys and there were other rodents around, these rats had more synapses in their brain, more &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10869/" target="_blank"&gt;glia cells&lt;/a&gt;. The physical environment that these rodents were [living] in was impacting their brains. And I was really taken by that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Then] I took this course with professor Steve Kaplan, and he was talking about this theory called &lt;a class="link" href="https://positivepsychology.com/attention-restoration-theory/" target="_blank"&gt;attention restoration theory&lt;/a&gt; and how people could restore their attention by interacting with natural environments. Steve, an advisor and I designed studies to test attention restoration theory, and I saw in the field there wasn’t really a place necessarily for this kind of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these studies on rodents were done years ago, and nothing was really tying it together. I saw all these different connections, and I thought, maybe I could help to define this new field of environmental neuroscience where we’d actually really see how the physical environment that surrounds us actually affects brain functioning and to try to combine cutting-edge techniques in cognitive neuroscience with ideas from environmental psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you talk about these terms you use in the book: “involuntary attention” and “soft fascination”? It seems like what you’re saying is, when we are in nature, it has a way of recharging us because of the way we’re dispensing our brain space or energy. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Let’s] start with attention restoration theory. One of the key tenets  that was posited by Steve Kaplan and his wife, Rachel Kaplan, is that humans have two kinds of attention. One kind of attention is called directed attention. Sometimes that’s called endogenous or top-down attention. That’s the kind of attention where you as the individual person are deciding what to pay attention to. So presumably you’re deciding to pay attention to me and what I’m saying, even if it might not be the most interesting thing that you could find in the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I do find what you’re saying interesting, just to be clear. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Laughs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt; Humans are really good at directing their attention, but we can only direct our attention for so long before we become mentally fatigued, and it’s hard to focus. We’ve all had that sensation at the end of a long workday where you might be just staring at the computer screen and, you know, nothing’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you can’t focus anymore, like that, we say that you’re in a directed attention fatigue state. You’ve exhausted this directed attention resource. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s different from involuntary attention, which is when our attention is automatically captured by interesting stimulation in the environment. Bright lights, loud noises, those kinds of stimulation automatically capture our attention, and we don’t really have any control over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt; &lt;div class="infobox" data-click="infoBox" data-border-top data-module-id="00000198-c92c-d313-affb-fb3fd454000b"&gt;    &lt;p class="infobox-title"&gt;TAKEAWAYS&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="infobox-description"&gt;From “Nature and the Mind: The Science of How Nature Improves Cognitive, Physical, and Social Well-Being”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Like the loud buzz of a motorcycle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it’s thought that that kind of attention is less susceptible to fatigue or depletion. So, you don’t often hear people say, ‘Oh, I can’t look at that beautiful waterfall anymore. It’s just too interesting to look at. I’m too tired.’ One of the ideas with attention restoration theory is that if you can find environments that don’t place a lot of demands on your directed attention while simultaneously having interesting stimulation that activates the involuntary attention, you could restore or replenish [your] directed attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OK, what would be an example of that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We say that the kind of stimulation that activates involuntary attention has to be what we call “softly fascinating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you look at that waterfall, it doesn’t capture all of your attentional resources. You can still mind-wander and think about other things while you’re looking at the waterfall. If you’re in Times Square, it’s also super interesting. It captures a lot of your attentional focus, but it does so in an all-consuming way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of stimulation that gives you this restful, restorative experience has to be softly fascinating and not harshly fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the book, you write quite a bit about the curving design of nature and its benefits. For the cynics among us, I wanted to ask: Can we just design more nature around us and more of its elements into buildings and benefit without actually being in nature — without taking a walk in the park or in the woods? Is it just curves that we need? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can get some of the benefits that way. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-gaudi-barcelona-20180311-story.html"&gt;Antoni Gaudí&lt;/a&gt; and other architects knew that in how they designed buildings, and people really like those kinds of buildings that have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rmcad.edu/blog/biophilic-design-integrating-nature-into-modern-interiors/" target="_blank"&gt;biophilic design&lt;/a&gt;, where they mimic the patterns of nature in design. I don’t view that as a replacement for nature. That’s sort of like a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find that in a lot of our studies, going into actual nature gives you the biggest bang for your buck, because being in nature, you get all the modalities: the visual, the auditory, the tactile, even the olfactory, the smell. You’re getting that whole kind of experience that I think you just can’t really mimic in a built space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t want to say, “Oh, the takeaway is, if we found all the nature ingredients, we can destroy all the nature and then just build it.” No, we have to preserve all the nature, because we can’t engineer anything as good as nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;    &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Maggie Chiang / For The Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You write about the benefits of experiencing nature when one is depressed, anxious or grieving. What is it about nature that helps the anxious or depressed mind? Is it that we are finally putting our phones away? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve done studies with people who have been diagnosed with clinical depression and we weren’t actually sure if the nature walk would be as beneficial to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We thought, “Well, if nature increases attention and cognitive abilities and if somebody is suffering from depression and they’re ruminating about negative thoughts and feelings, maybe a walk alone in nature might actually increase depression and increase depressive rumination.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did the same walking study [with] a nonclinical sample. But with these participants with clinical depression, we actually induced them to ruminate about negative thoughts and feelings before they went on the walk. And we found that the walk in nature was actually more beneficial to participants suffering from clinical depression than it was for our nonclinical samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We think that’s because when you are in a depressive state and you’re ruminating about negative thoughts and feelings, that’s actually robbing a lot of your attentional focus and your directed attention. So nature is boosting them up, and we think that is giving them the cognitive resources to then deal with their depression and their rumination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the book, you talk about how nature can make us see each other again as people. How do we, and especially parents worried about their kids growing up in this sort of dehumanizing culture that we’re in, tap into that benefit? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a study done by some researchers from China where they found that being in nature, you’re not so egocentric. You feel like you’re part of something larger. And then that actually increases feeling of humanization of others. Even though there may not be people out there, you start feeling more connected to everybody, in part probably because you’re feeling more connected to nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they found this could even happen with indoor plants, which they found increased feelings of humanization of others and self-transcendence. And it wasn’t just driven by nature making people feel good. It was about nature increasing these feelings of self-transcendence, and then that increased feelings of humanization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You and I have both said “in nature” multiple times. How do you define “in nature”? Like, what’s the baseline for when our brain says, “I am in nature”?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a hard thing to define. It probably differs for different people, like your dad‘s definition of nature [in Oklahoma] might differ from somebody living in New York or Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does one person conceive as natural that another does not? What does appear to be very consistent across cultures is this nature preference — that people do prefer things that look more natural to things that look more built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How important is it, in terms of benefits of being in nature, that nature inspires awe? A walk in nature through a park that your average person would perceive as boring — does that benefit them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be going to the most awe-inspiring beautiful nature to get these cognitive benefits. But if the nature is so boring, like,  I don’t think you would get a benefit like walking through a cornfield per se. And we’ve actually asked people, “Do you like the cornfield more or walking through a tree-lined urban street?” And people like the tree-lined urban street better than the cornfield. You might argue maybe the cornfield is actually less natural than the tree-lined street because it’s been so influenced by humans. But it’s just to say that not all nature is created equal, and not all urban is created equal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNbm1udXpVY3gzOHVfckI2NTFxUlJLNlA0blcwWXMza0xiaTlvdGVULVpCc0lFalIyMlM3Z1ZYYl9BdWlPV3BKNUtud0hiZllwN2NwNTI5ZHJzLUt5WERGR2FQcm1tUG9OZmhRRDRTeGN1eHdlWEVCR2toaTZLalk3Z19hUG1VNG1nUnRjTXhpYmpqT0dtaWdzODItUQ</guid></item><item><title>对于某些人来说，秋季新冠肺炎疫苗注射可能会自付—或根本没有保险- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE5XMlAxNGZfM3JIdmZKS2ZTVXV0a2tsVThKc3dWRDZyMjhxT0ttdkdzRlczRGpRSUIzZ0MyM3NzcFdFV2NQNW5PNFh0dHplNHhSRXcxb3JoRXdNaXNrZ1RXanNvWERhRlgxWE0wQg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in good health and plan to get a Covid shot this fall, you might end up with an unwelcome surprise: a bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the next round of Covid shots soon, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccines-fda-trials-delay-kids-adults-fall-rcna207718" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:but only for a smaller, high-risk group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;but only for a smaller, high-risk group&lt;/a&gt; — adults 65 and older and people with underlying health conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is likely to follow suit, limiting its recommendation on who should get the shots to the same groups. (The CDC currently recommends Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change, experts say, could affect what insurers are willing to cover for everyone else &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/updated-covid-vaccines-fall-may-jeopardy-rfk-jrs-new-rules-rcna204242" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:who doesn’t fall under a high-risk group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;who doesn’t fall under a high-risk group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By law, most health insurance plans are required to fully cover vaccines recommended by the CDC and its outside advisory committee, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t fall under the CDC’s new recommendations, experts say coverage would depend entirely on their insurance — with some deciding to fully cover the shot, others requiring a copay and some not covering it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without insurance, a Covid shot can cost up to $140, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC’s vaccine price list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the CDC’s vaccine price list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could very well get confusing,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and an adviser to ACIP. Whether you’re able to get a free shot “may greatly depend on which company with which you have your insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who can get a Covid vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the expected recommendations from the CDC, healthy children and adults won’t be barred from getting the Covid vaccine, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at UC Law San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s legal to give a vaccine off-label,” Reiss said, referring to when a doctor prescribes a drug for something different than what the FDA approved it for, “and insurance companies can choose to cover them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for AHIP, a health insurance industry trade group, said that every individual insurer will come up with its own policy following the CDC’s final guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:list of conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;list of conditions&lt;/a&gt; that put a person at high risk for severe illness from Covid is extensive, and includes cancer, heart disease and lung conditions as well as physical inactivity and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurers also take into account clinical recommendations from outside medical organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the AAP, which has expressed its disapproval for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s vaccine decisions, released its own recommendations supporting Covid vaccinations for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are also unlikely to notice changes to their insurance coverage overnight — if there are any, according to the AHIP spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For private plans — including Obamacare plans — any changes stemming from ACIP meetings could likely only be implemented in the next benefit year, typically Jan. 1, the spokesperson said. That means it’s possible that people who get a shot before then might be covered. Medicare and Medicaid plans are required to follow ACIP recommendations immediately upon the CDC director’s signature. Covid vaccines have also already been factored into insurers’ plans for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Blue Cross and Blue Shield said that “each independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan will make their own coverage decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Aetna said pregnant women and children will be able to get the new Covid booster this fall and winter with no copay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy adults who get Aetna coverage through their jobs might have different coverage, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if that means they’ll have to pay or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Covid and flu shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes could affect people planning to get their Covid and flu vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said some people choose to get their Covid and flu shots at the same time, but there are concerns that some could be turned away due to the anticpated change in recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that misinformation about who is able to get the Covid shots may also discourage people from getting either vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we have to reassure people, particularly those at high risk, that the vaccine will be available to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rick Gates, Walgreens’ chief pharmacy officer, said its pharmacists usually determine whether a patient has coverage before a vaccine is administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it’s unlikely anyone would be hit with a surprise bill due to new CDC recommendations, he said, adding that the patient would first be told whether the vaccine is fully covered, a copay is required or the patient must pay entirely out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said that people are already coming in for their flu shot, but many seem to be holding off on the Covid shot until the updated version is available. During last year’s respiratory virus season peak, he said, more than 50% of patients got both shots at once — a number that has grown over the past two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:14:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5XMlAxNGZfM3JIdmZKS2ZTVXV0a2tsVThKc3dWRDZyMjhxT0ttdkdzRlczRGpRSUIzZ0MyM3NzcFdFV2NQNW5PNFh0dHplNHhSRXcxb3JoRXdNaXNrZ1RXanNvWERhRlgxWE0wQg</guid></item><item><title>对于某些人来说，秋季新冠肺炎疫苗注射可能会自付—或者根本没有报道- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOWgwR29Kb1BpN2VMQmlaeEdYQko5M0IwejZXRUZsa1VCVGNudHlHUjU1SkVnWjRvclQyRkp1cE9ISXphSHNvNk96OVRLNWlobXpDb0h3VWVfRGh6ZDFOY3B6T0FYZy00a3JmbTlSc0phdUdnVl8yeG9NZnpQbGZoUGtVSGFRUEdQbTh4enEyMGtLcTgzS2tveTgtanBFNkhh0gFWQVVfeXFMUFFkXzlCcGZTUkZNWUFQQ2prU1pJU250R2FSNXZNYUJOc3preXpLQTRoX25ULWpTdFdDSzJacDFNT2liVFpIbDQxUWlHbU5LNXROYlRxakE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-61cbef" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re in good health and plan to get a Covid shot this fall, you might end up with an unwelcome surprise: a bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b1267" class="body-graf"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the next round of Covid shots soon, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccines-fda-trials-delay-kids-adults-fall-rcna207718"&gt;but only for a smaller, high-risk group&lt;/a&gt; — adults 65 and older and people with underlying health conditions.
