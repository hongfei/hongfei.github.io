			&lt;p&gt;Deep within your bone marrow, a specialized set of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; is busy pumping out &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-origins-of-our-blood-are-not-what-we-thought-mouse-study-suggests"&gt;new blood cells&lt;/a&gt; to sustain your body. As we age, these &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell"&gt;hematopoietic stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (or HSCs) become less productive, affecting our immune system and increasing our risk of conditions like anemia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists have found a way to rewind the clock in aging HSCs, which could potentially help to treat age-related blood and immune deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most of our cells, HSCs contain tiny compartments known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysosome"&gt;lysosomes&lt;/a&gt;. These are the cells' recycling centers, where complex molecules like proteins and lipids are sent to be broken down into smaller, reusable parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/embryo-like-blood-factories-could-one-day-supplement-donations"&gt;Embryo-Like 'Blood Factories' Could One Day Supplement Donations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that many of the problems that arise in elderly HSCs are due to lysosomes gone haywire, as revealed in a new study by researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the US and Paris Cité University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="182930" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stem cell&lt;/a&gt; biologist Saghi Ghaffari led experiments in mice to find that the lysosomes in the HSCs of elderly mice were extremely acidic and downright dysfunctional. HSCs collected from old mice were in overdrive, ramping up the cell's glucose metabolism and messing with the way the cell activates and uses genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hyperactivity is the opposite of how young HSCs behave: They are renowned for their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.09.029"&gt;quiescence&lt;/a&gt;, a reversible pause button that grants cells a period of stability and longevity by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.16472"&gt;avoiding stress and DNA damage&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible. Quiescence also makes young HSCs more potent blood cell producers when re-awakened than aged cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghaffari and team were able to 'quieten' the distressed, elderly lysosomes in old HSCs with a chemical named &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Concanamycin-a"&gt;concanamycin A&lt;/a&gt;, which returned their pH and activity levels to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By removing the HSCs from mice and treating them with the chemical before returning the cells to their owners, the tissue's ability to produce new blood cells increased eight times over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their lysosomes stabilized, old stem cells began to behave more 'youthfully', too. Their ability to regenerate improved, and they resumed blood cell production in appropriate ratios, reversing the old HSCs' tendency to reduce the immune system's efficiency by producing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.V100.4.1302.h81602001302_1302_1309"&gt;more of certain cells&lt;/a&gt; than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings reveal that aging in blood stem cells is not an irreversible fate. Old blood stem cells have the capacity to revert to a youthful state; they can bounce back," Ghaffari &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-scientists-reverse-aging-in-blood-stem-cells-by-targeting-lysosomal-dysfunction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By slowing down the lysosomes and reducing their acidity, stem cells became healthier and could make new, balanced blood cells and new stem cells much more effectively. By targeting lysosomal hyperactivity, we were able to reset aged stem cells to a younger, healthier state, improving their ability to regenerate blood and immune cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elderly HSCs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5966/sctm.2012-0033"&gt;aren't highly suitable candidates&lt;/a&gt; for stem cell transplants, but the stem cells treated with concanamycin A appeared rejuvenated and were successfully transplanted in an animal model, suggesting a similar &lt;em&gt;ex vivo &lt;/em&gt;treatment could be used to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-key-to-creating-blood-stem-cells-may-lie-in-your-own-blood"&gt;improve the success&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/turns-out-that-bone-marrow-isn-t-the-only-place-in-our-body-we-make-blood-cells"&gt;human stem cell transplants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, further testing will be needed as the study only focused on how this all works in the cells of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lysosomal dysfunction emerges as a central driver of stem cell aging," Ghaffari &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/mount-sinai-scientists-reverse-aging-in-blood-stem-cells-by-targeting-lysosomal-dysfunction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Targeting this pathway may one day help maintain healthy blood and immune systems in the elderly, improve their stem cells for transplantation, and reduce the risk of age-associated blood disorders and perhaps have an effect on overall aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.10.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ingredient which is found in a number of plants, though it has been described as the nearest thing to 'natural Ozempic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to a 2022 review of 18 studies, a berberine supplement resulted in reduced body weight, BMI, fasting blood glucose and LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It works by increasing insulin production by activating bitter taste receptors in the intestines, which decreases body weight and lipids, increasing GLP-1 in turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A daily cup of green tea could make all the difference, according to the study (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wheat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Wheat protein hydrolysate is a protein which is derived from wheat when broken down and it contains high amounts of amino acids and peptides, which can lower blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It does this by releasing GLP-1, which can also help to reduce hyperglycemia according to past studies, say the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermented green tea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's said that fermenting tea with a culture of bacteria and yeast, which can form kombucha, can make a drink which 'mimics' Ozempic. This is because of compounds that are found in green tea particularly, primarily epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an antioxidant known for its inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A 2018 study &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1756464618302470"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that this can even stimulate GLP-1 release if taken with caffeine, after a study on mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A cup of green tea alone can enhance methods of treating diabetes, with a daily dose can help to stimulate characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 03:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOUUowQmNmOTEySjc3eHBwamF3R3g4djhtR245cUhGT2p4U1JFM2FYNW5JV0toVUxybG95ZDdmemF3QWlfNHVjV1phNWN3c2VkQTB3TzF4U1Z2LThQS2VSOEdoM0s2NkJoc25jTXhRREZqRXdiZHl1bHJrcFRqalI4LTB4R3ltTElKVnIzTkFOMTN2N1hDYV9YU2VKXzlBaGc4</guid></item><item><title>忘记药物：血糖专家揭示预防2型糖尿病的日常家庭习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/forget-medicine-blood-sugar-experts-reveal-daily-home-habits-to-prevent-type-2-diabetes/articleshow/125582096.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the secret to protecting your family from Type 2 diabetes was not found in a clinic but in your everyday routines including your dinner table, your evening walks, even your bedtime habits? Doctors say that prevention begins long before medication does and often with the simplest moments like moving together, eating better, sleeping well and learning to hit pause on stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world continues to experience one of the fastest rises in type 2 diabetes, Dr Jimmy Prabhakaran, Consultant - Internal Medicine at Rela Hospital in Chennai, note in an interview with the Times of India, “Even young individuals are prone to develop Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The current scenario is such that no age is safe anymore. Diabetes now affects teenagers, young adults and even children.” While genetics play a major role, he asserted that the contributing factors apart from genetic susceptibility are consumption of junk food, not eating on time, physical activity, childhood obesity, stress and lack of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts insist that small, daily lifestyle habits can reduce this risk dramatically.

The researchers found, “Higher levels of total physical activity were associated with a significantly lower risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, this can be as simple as evening walks, cycling together, weekend swimming sessions or short dance workouts at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Managing screen time: Digital discipline for all ages&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman warned that excessive screen time, in both children and adults, creates a cycle of inactivity, overeating and disrupted sleep. “Too much screen time promotes an inactive lifestyle and encourages irregular eating and sleep patterns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global research confirms this. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6688457" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2021 study in the Journal of Diabetes Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that prolonged screen time was directly associated with higher BMI and poorer glycaemic indicators in adults. The researchers revealed, “Longer screen time was significantly linked with obesity and increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman recommended simple screen-time discipline strategies that include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting a daily limit to use phones if not for educational purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid screen time while eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace casual screen times with reading books and other activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a no-screens-one-hour-before-bed rule as it disturbs your sleep time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress management: Protecting both mind and metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress significantly affects blood sugar. Dr Sundararaman explained, “Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which raises blood glucose levels. Teaching children to manage emotions early builds lifelong resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aligns with evidence from a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.04.012" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2017 study published in Psychoneuroendocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which showed that stress-induced cortisol spikes impair the body’s ability to regulate glucose, increasing diabetes risk. The study established, “Higher cortisol responses were associated with an increased incidence of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sundararaman advised healthy stress-management habits that families can adopt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 minutes of daily deep-breathing or guided meditation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritising consistent sleep (7–8 hours)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily “unplugged” family time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open communication without digital distractions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutrition: Small swaps that make a big difference&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jimmy Prabhakaran emphasised how dietary patterns shape metabolic health from childhood onward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Minor changes in lifestyle, especially food choices, play an important role in preventing diabetes. Whole grains like brown rice, wheat and millets, along with low-GI foods such as sweet potatoes and beans, are extremely helpful,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

			&lt;p&gt;Can tattoos protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays, or do they make things worse? A new study I conducted with colleagues suggests there may be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that people with tattoos had a 29% higher risk of developing melanoma, a serious form of skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183256" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; often linked to ultraviolet (UV) exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tattoos did not appear to increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma, another type of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/skin-cancer-1260"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt; related to UV damage. Although both cancers share a common cause, they arise from different cell types and differ in severity, with melanoma being far more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/could-a-tattoo-raise-your-risk-of-skin-cancer-twin-studies-suggest-a-link"&gt;Could a Tattoo Raise Your Risk of Skin Cancer? Twin Studies Suggest a Link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tattoos are a powerful form of self-expression and a cornerstone of modern identity. In Sweden, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurpub/ckaf178/8323409"&gt;around one in three adults&lt;/a&gt; is tattooed, showing how body art has moved firmly into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite their popularity, scientists still do not know whether tattoos have any impact on health, or how any potential effects might unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists are now trying to answer these questions. The work is challenging because people who choose to get tattoos often differ from those who do not in ways that can influence health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty is that most health records do not note whether someone is tattooed, which means long-term patterns are hard to study. Without this basic information, it becomes difficult to know whether tattoos themselves play a role in health or whether differences are driven by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma both develop slowly and are relatively uncommon, which makes long-term research challenging. Following large groups of tattooed and non-tattooed people for many years would be expensive and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-025-01326-6"&gt;So our team used a different approach&lt;/a&gt;. We started with people who had already been diagnosed with cancer and looked backward to see who had tattoos. This type of research, known as a case-control study, is an efficient way to detect potential associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden maintains high-quality national registers that record information on health and demographics. From &lt;a href="https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/en/statistics-and-data/registers/national-cancer-register/"&gt;the National Cancer Register&lt;/a&gt;, we identified everyone aged 20 to 60 who was diagnosed with melanoma in 2017 or squamous cell carcinoma between 2014 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This included 2,880 melanoma cases and 2,821 squamous cell carcinoma cases. For each case, we selected three comparison people of the same age and sex from the Total Population Register, who had not been diagnosed with skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then sent questionnaires to all participants, asking about tattoos, including decorative tattoos, permanent makeup and medical tattoos, as well as their size, location, and age at first tattoo. This allowed us to establish whether someone had been tattooed before or after developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5,695 people took part in the melanoma study (1,598 with melanoma) and 6,151 in the squamous cell carcinoma study (1,600 with that cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with tattoos were 29% more likely to develop melanoma compared with those without tattoos. The risk increase seemed to be highest in those who had tattoos for more than ten years, although the numbers were smaller in this group, so results should be interpreted cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For squamous cell carcinoma, tattoos made no difference. The results were consistent across analyses, suggesting no link between tattoos and this type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found no evidence that larger tattoos increased risk. This was unexpected, since larger tattoos contain more ink and therefore more potentially harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that tattoo ink does not remain confined to the skin. The body's immune system treats it as a foreign substance and transports some ink &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28900193/"&gt;particles to the lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These particles can stay there long-term. While we do not yet know whether this causes harm, it could potentially lead to chronic inflammation, which has been linked to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another explanation may be measurement error: people tend to overestimate tattoo size. Future studies using more precise measures may help clarify this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle and confounding factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this study unique is the range of lifestyle factors we could consider. We included data on sun exposure (both occupational and recreational), tanning bed use, smoking, education level, marital status and household income. We also factored in skin type, pigmentation, age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These details matter because they can influence both who gets tattoos and who develops cancer. For instance, people who spend a lot of time in the sun may be more likely to have tattoos and to develop melanoma. Accounting for these differences reduces bias and strengthens confidence in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research, this issue is known as confounding. If &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/confounding-factors"&gt;confounding factors&lt;/a&gt; are not properly controlled, they can distort findings and lead to misleading conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djaf235/8239343"&gt;US research&lt;/a&gt; suggested that large tattoos might even reduce the risk of melanoma, but that study did not control for key factors such as skin type or UV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may therefore reflect behaviour rather than biology. For example, people with large tattoos may avoid sunbathing or tanning beds to protect their body art, which would naturally reduce UV damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tattoos-linked-to-increased-cancer-risk-scientists-warn"&gt;Tattoos Linked to Increased Cancer Risk, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do tattoos cause skin cancer? The simple answer is that we do not know yet. Our results suggest a possible link between tattoos and melanoma, but one study is never enough to prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to explore potential biological mechanisms, such as chronic inflammation, and to examine how different types of ink or colours might interact with UV exposure. The composition of tattoo pigments varies widely, and many contain compounds that can break down into &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25833639/"&gt;harmful by-products&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to sunlight or laser removal treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have tattoos, there is no need for panic, but awareness matters. Continue to protect your skin from UV radiation just as you would otherwise: use sunscreen, avoid excessive tanning and check your skin regularly for new or changing moles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings highlight the need for long-term monitoring and better data collection on tattoos in health records. With tattoos now common worldwide, this is an important public health issue. Continued research into the biology of tattoos and their long-term effects will help ensure that people can make informed choices about their bodies, their art and their health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266809/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

During the study, two-thirds of patients did not have any asthma attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, prof David Jackson, who is a respiratory medicine expert at King’s College London and asthma services clinical lead at Guy’s and Royal Brompton hospitals, said: “As tezepelumab also suppresses allergy-related symptoms and improves chronic rhinosinusitis as well, the results are particularly exciting for patients with severe asthma who suffer with both upper and lower airway symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to the findings, Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/asthma" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Asthma&lt;/a&gt; + Lung UK, said: “This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s vital that research into new types of treatment continues, but we know current funding for lung health research is on life support, despite lung conditions remaining the third biggest cause of death in the UK. Studies like this show the positive impact that research can make on providing potentially life-changing treatment for people with asthma and other lung conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Any new interventions that may help patients manage their symptoms more easily and in a safe and effective way would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The prospect of a monthly injection, rather than daily tablets, may also be a more manageable treatment option for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“As with any emerging research, it’s important the findings are carefully assessed and considered as clinical guidelines, which GPs use in their daily practice, are developed and updated, based on the latest evidence to ensure safety and benefit for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 23:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNeTRhZ1hmV3JCNzIyQThoM0FYeTQ4eDN0cDNOeUFqYmhqU29KenljeXM2aGdEVUJocmxZN2pjWHJ4VVp4TDczM1VCMldZbVdVanBUX2I2QmZxMlRHT2NGcjBTbGw5UVFlYW5TU19xa2Eyc0s0T0l3c3JfbHU5b0R4Q1ZhZjUzQ1lUUnhiSk0yd3lzMV9PREo4eS1lbGFyUU9LSHdaVU85SjZIT3VPT2l2NTJVWVo</guid></item><item><title>国际传播的突变型流感病毒株可能在加利福尼亚州起飞- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/california/article/mutated-influenza-may-take-off-california-21208372.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;div class="tdb-block-inner td-fix-index"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH) acknowledged Wednesday that the controversial &lt;a href="https://monseyscoop.com/outrageous-robocall-rockland-county-sends-unauthorized-measles-alert-misusing-hatzolohs-name/"&gt;measles-related robocall sent to thousands of Ramapo residents did not match the message previously discussed with Hatzoloh of Rockland&lt;/a&gt;, despite the two organizations having coordinated on a general vaccination reminder ahead of the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCDOH said it had worked with Hatzolah on crafting a notification, but “the message that was agreed upon was not what was ultimately sent out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We regret how it played out,” the department added, noting that officials are reviewing the incident “to ensure it does not happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsey Scoop reached out to Hatzoloh, which said they appreciate the county’s clarification and “hope to work together going forward to ensure the right messaging is communicated to the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county also reminded residents that free measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations will be available next week through the RCDOH Mobile Vaccination Van:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, December 2&lt;br&gt;
10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.&lt;br&gt;
Rockland Kosher Supermarket, 27 Orchard Street, Monsey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMR vaccines are also available at local healthcare providers, including Refuah Health and Sun River Health, or by calling the Rockland County Department of Health at 845-364-2497 or 845-364-2520.&lt;/p&gt;

Utah experts advise a radon test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think about family history, genetics, or age when they think about Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those factors are well known, researchers are now studying whether long-term exposure to certain environmental conditions may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those conditions is radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas found throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah health and environmental experts encourage residents to pay attention to radon levels in their homes, especially because radon exposure builds slowly over time and can go unnoticed for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test kit at &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_top" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon forms naturally as uranium in soil and rock breaks down. It moves upward and can enter homes through small openings in foundations, basements, crawl spaces and utility gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon has no color, taste, or odor, so homeowners cannot detect it without a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the [Envionmental Protection Agency](Envionmental Protection Agency), long-term radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has a higher radon potential than many other states due to its unique geology. Recent data shows that almost half of all Utah homes have elevated radon levels, underscoring the importance of routine testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do we know about Alzheimer's risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients are 65 and older, and the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. Genetics, family history and certain heart and blood vessel conditions may also contribute to increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Beaunitta Van Wyk/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say about radon and cognitive health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to study whether long-term exposure to radon may affect neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671130/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Environmental Health Perspectives found evidence that ionizing radiation may contribute to cellular changes associated with Alzheimer's. The authors noted that these effects may accumulate over many years of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more studies are needed before drawing firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because radon exposure is preventable, Utah residents have an opportunity to reduce one potential environmental risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is simple. Families can order a free test kit from &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_mid" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why radon testing matters for Utah families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Utah homeowners who test their homes are surprised by their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon has no symptoms and no noticeable signs, homes with elevated levels often appear completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is straightforward. UtahRadon.org provides free test kits to all Utah residents. The test only takes a few minutes to place in the home and is then mailed to a certified third-party laboratory for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If your home tests high&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels can be reduced by installing a mitigation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are installed by certified professionals and are designed to continuously vent radon from beneath the home to the outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most installations are completed in a single visit and begin lowering radon levels immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is invisible and odorless, but it is measurable, and homeowners have control over their exposure. Testing allows families to understand their risk and take action if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test by visiting &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_bottom" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it.

New research suggests simpler physical therapies can give stronger relief with fewer risks for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study of thousands of patients points to knee braces, warm water therapy, and structured exercise as top options for knee arthritis. These approaches work without adding new drugs and help people climb and walk with less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-osteoarthritis-and-pills"&gt;Osteoarthritis and pills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with osteoarthritis, a joint disease that slowly damages cartilage and limits movement, are told to manage pain with pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, about 528 million people live with osteoarthritis and roughly 365 million have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oregano-herb-helps-reduce-and-prevent-joint-pain-from-arthritis/"&gt;knee involvement&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Yuan Luo, a rehabilitation specialist at the First People’s Hospital of Neijiang in southwest China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo’s research focuses on comparing non drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis to help patients avoid unnecessary medication side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with knee arthritis rely on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547742/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NSAIDs&lt;/a&gt;), medicines that reduce inflammation but can harm the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs also raise concerns about kidney stress and heart problems when used for long periods, particularly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5772852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of NSAID use in people over 60 found higher rates of serious gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney injury among regular users. That work also tied long term NSAID exposure to more cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-study-did-differently"&gt;What this study did differently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of testing one treatment at a time, Luo’s team compared many therapies at once. They used a network meta-analysis, a method that combines results from many trials, so treatments can be ranked together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the comparison, researchers pooled 139 trials that tested 12 non-drug options for knee osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those trials examined laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, taping, ultrasound, hydrotherapy, and several exercise programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined standard rating scales that scored pain, stiffness, and day to day function. Those scores let them estimate which options worked best overall without letting any single small study dominate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions,” said Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-braces-shift-the-load"&gt;How braces shift the load&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A knee brace for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt; is usually a rigid or semi rigid device that wraps around the joint. By changing how body weight passes through the knee, the brace can take pressure off the worn compartment and reduce irritation of sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical research on unloader braces, rigid supports that relieve pressure from one side of the knee, shows clear short term pain relief. Several trials also report better function and longer walking distance when people use these braces consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overview of 14 brace studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6028281/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that many users experienced better overall quality of life while they wore the device. The authors also found early signs that bracing could delay knee replacement for some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braces have drawbacks, including bulk, skin irritation, and the hassle of wearing them for hours per day. Real world studies suggest many people stop using their brace or wear it only briefly, so comfort and fit can influence success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-water-and-exercise-matter"&gt;Why water and exercise matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrotherapy involves guided exercise in warm water that supports body weight and lets joints move with less impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955208/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of aquatic exercise programs found that water based sessions reduce pain and joint dysfunction for people with osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those benefits were especially clear for participants who struggled to tolerate land based workouts because of pain or poor balance. In Luo’s ranking, hydrotherapy rose to the top when a combined arthritis score was used, capturing gains in pain, stiffness, and daily function together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern fits reports from pool programs that work with older adults who have knee arthritis. In warm water, they can practice balance, strength, and walking drills without the sharp jolts they feel on dry ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land based exercise also remains a central part of care for people with knee osteoarthritis. Walking, strengthening, simple balance drills, supervised sessions, and support for weight and self management are all strongly recommended in major clinical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518852/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-treatment"&gt;What this means for treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ranking supports a model where braces, exercise, and hydrotherapy sit at the center of long term care. In that approach, medications are used carefully as add ons, not the automatic first line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these physical treatments shift load, strengthen muscles, and retrain movement patterns, they aim at causes of pain rather than only numbing signals. That focus on mechanics and strength can matter more than short courses of pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International bodies now encourage combinations of non drug and drug therapies tailored to each person with knee symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibiofemoral bracing and structured exercise sit among the most strongly endorsed options for painful knee osteoarthritis. Practical care plans often layer a brace for high demand activities with regular supervised exercise sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pool time when available and short courses of medication during symptom flares are added instead of escalating straight to injections or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-to-learn-about-osteoarthritis"&gt;More to learn about osteoarthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/womans-knee-pain-caused-by-the-presence-of-gold-threads-in-her-joints/"&gt;knee arthritis&lt;/a&gt; can ask their clinician whether an unloading brace or a supervised exercise program is appropriate for their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also ask about referral to aquatic therapy when their balance, weight, or other conditions make land exercise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about brace fit, how many hours to wear it, and which exercises are safe help tailor treatment and may improve comfort and adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific goals, such as hiking, kneeling, or climbing stairs for work, can guide which therapies deserve the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still need longer studies that follow brace users and exercise participants over several years. Those trials could reveal whether these approaches delay joint replacement and remain cost effective as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo and colleagues also note that combinations of therapies, such as bracing plus hydrotherapy, could prove more powerful than any single option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust trials of those treatment packages are still rare, so the best mix and timing remain open questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0324864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:58:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNajRIdXFPeTNSZUEzYlRBdWhrbE01bDVWMWdNZXBmUWg3QzhIYmQ0YVNET09kNkYwdkR6d2F2X2UtR3MybUlQM2JrczFBcE5kOFU2dzg2MGlmODU0YlluVTZJVDYxQWJiVnJXNGZpV3Z0blFoX0x2Nm56YV9wOU92R2Q3QjZfdDVyZEdlWTNrekJNc2h1SVN1dHh5VU5wTHh3bE5HQ0hHOVI</guid></item><item><title>2026年推出的狗用抗衰老药？ FDA支持的药物须知|《印度斯坦时报》-《印度斯坦时报》</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/pet/anti-aging-pills-for-dogs-coming-in-2026-what-to-know-about-fda-backed-drug-101764183851164.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/pet/anti-aging-pills-for-dogs-coming-in-2026-what-to-know-about-fda-backed-drug-101764183851164.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new anti-aging pill for &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/us/most-popular-dog-breed-of-2025-in-us-its-not-golden-retriever-101758291889420.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="dogs"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; that has the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fda" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="FDA"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;'s backing and is reportedly close to getting approval as well, several &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/regulating-social-media-for-children-101763999954648-amp.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="social media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; posts have claimed.

(Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The news was shared online by several accounts. “New pill that makes dogs live longer set to be released next year,” wrote Polymarket, which touts itself to be the world's largest prediction market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Another page noted “The first anti-aging pill for dogs just got FDA backing and is now closer to approval, which could help senior dogs stay healthier for longer.&lt;/span&gt;” Yet another added, “New pill that could make dogs live longer set to be released next year.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What is the anti-aging pill that is being spoken about?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pill being spoken about is LOY-002, from Loyal, a clinical-stage veterinary medicine company, which is focused on giving dogs ‘longer, healthier lives’. While the news of the pill has begun to do the rounds now, the company had shared an update about it in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;LOY-002, our program bringing longevity to dogs of almost all sizes, has also earned its formal FDA acceptance for reasonable expectation of efficacy (RXE),” the company announced in a blog post.&lt;/span&gt; The company noted there were two more primary FDA requirements for conditional approval. These are manufacturing and safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company had noted that it had extensive date supporting both and expressed a hope to have completed regulatory requirements by the end of 2025. This would make the FDA-approved longevity drug, which has been called anti-aging pill online, a reality for millions of dogs in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;WQHT or Hot 97 noted, “Loyal, a biotech company, has been developing a medication aimed at slowing aging in large-breed dogs, and early results indicate it may add more healthy years rather than extending the more fragile stage of life.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So far, the outlook is promising: a pilot study involving 48 dogs reported no adverse effects after three months of taking the drug,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;“The longevity space is crowded right now, and for good reason. We all want to figure out how to get more happy, healthy years for our loved ones — especially the furry ones,” Celine Halioua, founder and CEO of Loyal had said in a June 2025 &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/17/health/new-longevity-drug-for-dogs-could-extend-your-pets-life/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="interview"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with the New York Post. In February, Halioua had said on X, “Loyal’s drug for senior dog lifespan extension drug LOY-002 has completed its FDA efficacy package (RXE). We are on track to hopefully bring the first longevity drug to market *this year*.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How the anti-aging pill for dogs work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Loyal, LOY-002 is a caloric restriction mimetic. This means, it delivers the benefits of caloric restriction through a drug, thus creating a situation where there is no weight loss or appetite suppression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This comes after a study showed that calorie-restricted dogs lived ~2 years longer that other furry fellows, and saw a delayed onset of cancer and osteoarthritis.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This pill will be for ‘senior’ dogs, Loyal noted, and they stated they're pursuing FDA approval for use in dogs 10 years and older and who weigh at least 14 lbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着诺如病毒病例的增加，以下是关于今年传播的知识—以及如何保护自己- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-2025-spread-rise-contagious-symptoms-experts-what-know-rcna244719</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-55e861" class="body-graf"&gt;A nasty, highly contagious virus is spreading across the country ahead of the holiday season — and it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cold-and-flu/flu-season-just-beginning-doctors-are-already-high-alert-rcna245148" target="_blank"&gt;the flu&lt;/a&gt;

Between August and November 2024, there were 235 reported norovirus outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96bef7" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been 153 outbreaks during the same time period this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ec07" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the same level of illnesses will continue into 2026, but outbreaks are expected to keep rising, Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-182ed6" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have three years of data to kind of show that we have this strong seasonal pattern,” she said. “But I can’t say right now how big of a peak it will be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2b81" class="body-graf"&gt;A CDC spokesperson said the agency is closely monitoring the norovirus season, which is most common from November to April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aef629" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC tracks norovirus through voluntary reporting from clinical laboratories and health departments, but doesn’t currently monitor for norovirus through wastewater, which may be a reason its tracking doesn’t match the WastewaterScan data. People may be sick, but not go to the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2725b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Bidwell said wastewater is an “unbiased way of looking at what is happening in a community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a409e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s what to know about norovirus and its spread this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d5e34" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus variant becoming more dominant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aabe29" class="body-graf"&gt;For over 30 years, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3080904/" target="_blank"&gt;norovirus outbreaks have been dominated by one strain&lt;/a&gt;, GII.4. Last year’s outbreaks were &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0524_article" target="_blank"&gt;overwhelmingly caused&lt;/a&gt; by the variant GII.17, making up around 75% of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c987" class="body-graf"&gt;The GII.17 strain has become more prevalent in several countries, including the United States, through the 2020s. The rise of GII.17 may explain why the 2024 spikes and this year’s spread started earlier in October, instead of winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b60133" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Atmar, professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said a combination of factors may have led to GII.17’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-033782" class="body-graf"&gt;“The two possibilities is that something in the virus changed to make it more transmissible, or there were changes in the population that a larger proportion were susceptible,” he said. “And probably it’s a combination of both. But whether it’s going to persist this year, I think, is one of the big questions in our scientific community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ea117" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Craig Wilen, associate professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology at Yale University, said GII.17 may not actually be more transmissible, but many people probably have less immunity to the new variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-463d92" class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably the GII.17 last year was so effective at infecting so many people because we had significantly less immunity to that virus, since it was different enough from viruses that we’ve previously been infected with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fa9cc" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s difficult to say how this year’s norovirus season will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28da7b" class="body-graf"&gt;Atmar said either variant has a “50/50 chance” of dominating this year, but doesn’t expect the same level of illnesses as last year because of “increased immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-82a035" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus symptoms &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1eb627" class="body-graf"&gt;Norovirus is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious&lt;/a&gt;, human-only disease. Norovirus outbreaks can happen anywhere and cause around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;20 million infections&lt;/a&gt; a year. It’s responsible for over half of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-089da0" class="body-graf"&gt;It spreads from person to person through vomit or feces drops that end up in peoples’ mouths. It can also spread through coming in contact with contaminated food, water or surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-419a39" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;main symptoms &lt;/a&gt;are diarrhea and vomiting, earning it the name “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/norovirus-treatment-guide-effective-methods-protection-rcna185872" target="_blank"&gt;two-bucket disease&lt;/a&gt;.” Other symptoms include fever, stomach pain and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac533" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea may require medical attention for older adults, young children and people with weakened immune systems, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4a90c" class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms usually start within 12 to 48 hours after exposure and last for a few days. Someone can still spread the virus for more than two weeks, even after symptoms are gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-687185" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect against norovirus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f54d0d" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Norovirus is notoriously difficult to kill. &lt;/a&gt;It’s difficult to wash away and can survive temperatures up to 145°F. Many scientists call it the “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/205/11/1622/844989?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank"&gt;perfect pathogen&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-771edb" class="body-graf"&gt;Wilen said norovirus is “highly stable in the environment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-781fa2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s highly infectious. Traditional ethanol-based hand sanitizers don’t work as well for this virus as they do for other viruses,” the Yale associate professor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-718222" class="body-graf"&gt;In order to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;kill norovirus&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC recommends washing your hands vigorously with soap, cleaning infected areas with diluted bleach and washing infected clothes with hot water and detergent. Wearing gloves and throwing them out after cleaning adds protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea55ee" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruits and vegetables should be properly cleaned, and oysters and shellfish are properly cooked can also reduce infection risk, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-384c28" class="body-graf"&gt;There isn’t a specific treatment for norovirus, but &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355302" target="_blank"&gt;rehydration is key to replace lost fluids&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f6aa3" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Though there’s currently no vaccine for norovirus, a &lt;a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-1403-P301" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 3 Moderna trial is in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:02:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNS0VTZF9xeFVJaVR3NHJIdEdvazNIbDRNLU5DVGtyLUNzTFNFZW4weE1SS1JGekRadVJUb25ZejJrZFh1Q2tCemp6RjhmZ3BWMlAzck9JUHphSng5OEZqNzNaTXJzemNyV3NRaVVQbUd0ZlZmYmttOWpUUHFZZHhIQk5RM1FvbmVleFdjOTltR2w3VFJtVkc0VHM4ZFBHUnE0Wk1RT2dnZ2dmdFZkd25pMGN0OVhORjZxc3fSAVZBVV95cUxPeHVYOUdNcjF3U183dW92THZaVVNsaWxDYUJrQkxqdWRDT3piZEd5Y1Bic1ZEeTlCRzZVNnpPZnJROU5zQmxHMGl4d1JFSUxQaUNzMWFTdw</guid></item><item><title>早期发现癌症的新方法带来了希望和问题—《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/26/metro/cancer-detection-early-dana-farber/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many cancer doctors hope that tests like Galleri, which are sometimes called &lt;a href="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;“liquid biopsies,”&lt;/a&gt; will transform cancer care by detecting the earliest signs of malignancy, enabling treatment before the disease becomes deadly. They are part of an accelerating effort to find cancer earlier and earlier, through blood tests as well as new techniques and artificial intelligence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The goal is to take the same energy and skill that has been deployed to develop treatments for cancer, and put it to work at finding cancer early enough to stop it in its tracks, said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Clinic at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“How do we move from a reactive model where we are only picking up cancers when they declare themselves?” she said. O’Donnell is leading &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/clinical-trials/24-070" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of the Galleri test, recruiting 1,000 people at high risk for cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today, 70 percent of cancers have no screening test. People can be screened for cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, and, for heavy smokers, lung. Other tumors often grow without symptoms and are discovered when it’s too late to effectively treat them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The path to catching more cancers early is fraught with challenges. To be most effective, screening has to do more than just detect cancer: It has to find the right cancer at the right moment. When a test turns up cancer so indolent it was never going to harm the patient, it only sows fear and can lead to needless procedures. When it finds a cancer that is so aggressive there’s no stopping it, its value can be limited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You really want a screening test that finds the cancer and leads to the patient not dying,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, a noted expert in cancer prevention and control at Johns Hopkins University, who has consulted for GRAIL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When Burns White, 66, of Randolph, returned from the jazz festival, she was not immediately concerned. She’d been told that more often than not, a positive result from Galleri proves to be a false alarm. Her primary care doctor told her not to worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the result was pretty specific: It said cancer might be lurking in her breast, esophagus, and stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So Burns White consulted with doctors from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she works in community outreach and engagement. Two years ago, the hospital launched its &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/early-detection-interception" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Early Detection and Interception&lt;/a&gt;, which works with patients at high risk of cancer, those who receive troubling results from liquid biopsies, and others who learn of hard-to-interpret abnormalities from tests done for another purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White endured an endoscopy, an uncomfortable procedure involving threading a tube with a camera down her throat. The result was good news: no cancer of the esophagus or stomach. It would be a different story for breast cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A mammogram she had taken a few months before had detected masses — but they looked benign. The results of the GRAIL test “pushed us to look closer,” said O’Donnell, of Dana-Farber. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White underwent another set of mammograms, followed by MRIs and biopsies of both breasts. Doctors told her she had triple-negative breast cancer, a form that can be difficult to treat but that was still at an early stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Multicancer blood tests eventually will “change the face of early detection for cancer,” said Timothy R. Rebbeck, professor of cancer prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But they still need more work because, while they catch some cancers at an early stage, others are missed, he said. And even a screening tool that saves lives can have costs: follow-up testing and sometimes needless treatment, as well as “the psychosocial costs of having to go through all of this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Recent preliminary &lt;a href="https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2025/attendee/confcal/presentation/list?q=Galleri" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;results from the largest study of GRAIL’s Galleri test&lt;/a&gt; showed its promise and limitations. Galleri found many types of cancer for which there is no screening test, and 92 percent of the time it correctly identified where in the body the cancer originated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test was administered to 36,000 people aged 50 and older. Among the first 25,000 analyzed, Galleri&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found a “cancer signal” in 216 cases — and cancer was confirmed in 133, about 60 percent. That compares favorably with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq#_80_toc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mammography&lt;/a&gt;, said Megan P. Hall, vice president of medical and corporate affairs at GRAIL; she cited data showing that when a woman is called back for a follow-up mammogram, only 4 to 5 percent turn out to have cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were more false negatives than true positives — 196 people were told the test found no cancer but went on to develop it within the next year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, even though its purpose is early detection, nearly half the cancer cases the test found were already advanced. That’s because advanced cancers shed more DNA and are easier to pick up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The endgame in early detection may come down to better defining who is most at risk and thus most likely to benefit from screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, pancreatic cancer is almost always detected at an advanced stage. But it’s so rare that it would make no sense to screen everybody. Researchers are looking for ways to identify a subset of high-risk people who would benefit from screening,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Limor Appelbaum, a staff scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/24/metro/ai-predict-pancreatic-cancer/?p1" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;deploying AI&lt;/a&gt; to comb through the medical records of millions of patients, looking for patterns common among those who went on to develop pancreatic cancers, such as changes in blood chemistry or more frequent doctor’s visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Dana-Farber, researchers have identified one possible warning sign of pancreatic cancer: muscle loss. By studying blood samples from people who developed pancreatic cancer going back years before their diagnosis, and also looking at CT scans, researchers led by Dr. Brian Wolpin and Dr. Michael H. Rosenthal found evidence that the pancreas starts to falter, performing its key functions less well, long before any tumor forms. This weakens the body’s ability to absorb proteins in the diet, causing it to break down muscle. But many factors can cause muscle loss, so further study is needed before these measures can be put to use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors are working on a warning system for lung cancer. An AI program called Sybil scanned thousands of chest X-rays of people who were later diagnosed with the disease and learned the patterns seen before someone develops cancer in the lung, said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director of the &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/treatments-and-services/cancer-early-detection" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic&lt;/a&gt; at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“My vision for 25 years from now,” said Dana-Farber’s O’Donnell, “is that when you go to your primary care physician’s appointment, they say, ‘This is your risk score, and here are the screening tests you need.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who calls himself a “healthy skeptic” of cancer screening, would like to see the opposite: “If you want to lower the burden on patients,” he said, “develop the test that tells people they’re at low risk for cancer and [can] stop worrying about it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for Burns White, she’s happy with how the Galleri test played out for her. Once her breast cancer was diagnosed, she underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Today, a little over a year since her diagnosis, she continues to take a medication aimed at eradicating the remaining cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through it all, Burns White continued to work, taking off only a few days for the surgery. She expects her treatment to end in mid-December. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I remain strong and optimistic,” she said, “and grateful to have had access to treatment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Instead of starting when joint pain becomes noticeable, the disease quietly builds over many years. RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder that leads to inflammation and damage in the joints.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to new research, people who are at higher risk for RA undergo major changes in their immune system well before symptoms surface. Their bodies are already engaged in an unseen autoimmune struggle during this early, silent period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Multi-Institution Study Maps RA's Hidden Early Phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Allen Institute, CU Anschutz, University of California San Diego, and the Benaroya Research Institute worked together to uncover these early immune changes. Their findings, published in Science Translational Medicine, offer the most detailed view to date of how RA takes shape. By charting immune activity in individuals at risk, the team showed that the disease process is already underway long before joint problems are noticeable. These insights may help guide earlier intervention and possibly prevent disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, we hope this study raises awareness that rheumatoid arthritis begins much earlier than previously thought and that it enables researchers to make data-driven decisions on strategies to disrupt disease development," said Mark Gillespie, Ph.D., assistant investigator at the Allen Institute and co-senior author with Kevin Deane (CU Anschutz), M.D./Ph.D.; Adam Savage (Allen Institute), Ph.D.; Troy Torgerson (Allen Institute), M.D./Ph.D.; and Gary S. Firestein (UC San Diego), M.D. The research followed individuals with ACPA antibodies over seven years. These antibodies are well-established biomarkers for those at risk for RA. During the study, the team uncovered previously unrecognized contributors to disease progression, including widespread inflammation, immune system malfunction, and shifts in how certain immune cells function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We expect that going forward the findings from this study will support additional studies to identify ways to better predict who will get RA, identify potential biologic targets for preventing RA as well as identify ways to improve treatments for those with existing RA," said Kevin Deane, M.D./Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; The researchers observed that people at risk for RA already showed signs of systemic inflammation throughout the body. This inflammation was not limited to the joints. Instead, it resembled the body-wide inflammatory pattern commonly seen in individuals with active RA.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cell dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple immune cell types showed unusual behavior.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which normally create protective antibodies, were found in a heightened pro-inflammatory state.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T helper cells&lt;/strong&gt;, especially those similar to Tfh17 cells, had expanded far beyond typical levels. These cells help coordinate immune responses, including the creation of autoantibodies (antibodies that attack the body's own tissues). Their expansion helps explain why the immune system begins targeting healthy tissue.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular reprogramming:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most striking discoveries was that even "naive" T cells, which have not yet encountered pathogens, showed epigenetic changes. Although their DNA sequence remained intact, the regulation of their genes had shifted. This altered gene activity suggests these cells were being reprogrammed before encountering any threats.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint-like inflammation detected in blood:&lt;/strong&gt; The team also found that monocytes (a type of white blood cell) circulating in the bloodstream were producing high amounts of inflammatory molecules. Remarkably, these cells closely resembled the macrophages typically found in the inflamed joints of RA patients, indicating that the immune system was already setting the stage for joint inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Early Detection and Preventive Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight new early-warning indicators (biomarkers and immune signatures) that could help doctors determine which at-risk individuals are most likely to develop RA. Identifying the disease during this hidden phase may make it possible to monitor patients more closely and begin treatment earlier. If this process is caught in time, RA may be prevented before joint damage begins -- potentially sparing patients years of pain and disability. The research supports a shift from reacting to joint damage after it appears to preventing RA at its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers found that, in 28 days, people in the urolithin A group had changes in biomarkers associated with age-related immune decline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A leads to better cell function, but it also has a positive impact on muscle,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://georg-speyer-haus.de/en/forschung/forschungsgruppen/prof-dr-florian-greten" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Florian Greten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Florian Greten&lt;/a&gt;, MD, researcher and director of the Georg-Speyer-Haus Institut für Tumorbiologie. (Separate early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests urolithin A has the potential to enhance muscle health and performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greten says it’s “exciting” that he and other researchers were able to detect these positive changes within a month. “We don’t know yet if you can take a lower amount and get a similar impact, but we are studying that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urolithin A is a bioactive compound that’s produced in the gut when certain compounds (mostly ellagitannins and ellagic acid) are broken down by specific gut bacteria, explains Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: Not everyone produces urolithin A efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that only about 40 percent of people have the right gut microbiome for this,” Dr. Greten says. If you don’t have the "right" microbiome, meaning you're missing certain necessary bacteria, your gut won’t produce this compound efficiently through foods, he says, adding that there’s no publicly available test to see if you have these bacteria or not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, urolithin A supplements can theoretically work despite missing certain bacteria since it doesn't need to be converted, Dr. Greten says. Remember: Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement, including urolithin A, especially if you have preexisting medical conditions or are taking any medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Dr. Greten's study, here’s some additional preliminary research swirling around urolithin A. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Early research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Early research&lt;/a&gt; indicates urolithin A may support healthy aging by enhancing how your cells produce and recycle energy,” says Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Some small human &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788244" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest it could improve muscle endurance and aspects of immune function, but the research is still preliminary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the research surrounding urolithin A involves supplements, but certain foods may spark a process in your body that &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; urolithin A. “It’s not found in large amounts in food, but your body creates it after you eat foods that are rich in these precursor compounds,” Cording says.

But even then, you’d need to have a lot of these foods—Dr. Greten says you’d need to have 1.5 liters of pomegranate juice a day to mimic the effects of the supplement used in his study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately experts say that more research is needed around urolithin A.

&lt;p&gt;The prerecorded message stated that “a measles outbreak has occurred in our community,” instructing residents to get vaccinated, avoid public places if symptomatic, and to call Hatzoloh at 845-425-1600 for guidance, overwhelming the volunteer EMS organization with a sudden influx of non-emergency calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh of Rockland County confirmed to Monsey Scoop that the robocall was completely unauthorized, not coordinated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While measles is indeed a concern in various parts of the region, Hatzoloh emphasized that medical guidance, including vaccination questions, should be directed to personal physicians, not emergency hotlines intended for life-saving situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh further noted that their hotline was “bombarded with unnecessary calls” following the county-issued robocall, potentially delaying response to genuine emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders and residents alike expressed outrage that Rockland County disseminated a medical advisory using Hatzoloh’s name without permission, creating confusion and placing undue burden on a volunteer emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health concerns must always be taken seriously, and residents are urged to &lt;strong&gt;consult their doctors regarding vaccination, symptoms, and medical guidance&lt;/strong&gt;. But the county’s decision to issue a robocall in Hatzoloh’s name, without authorization, has raised significant questions about procedure, communication, and respect for community partners.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago we looked at &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/11/6/2351534/-Diabetes-News-Miracle-Fruit-Synsepalum-Dulcificum" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Miracle Fruit (Synsepalum Dulcificum)&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have a different fruit, also from China, of similar appearance, showing similar benefits in research on diabetic mice—Nitraria roborowskii Kom. The active chemical is NRK-C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting I read recently…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Science Daily]: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251107010302.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Rare desert berry could transform diabetes treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Desert Berry Restores Metabolic Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed analysis revealed the extract's impressive range of benefits. Over the course of seven weeks, NRK-C reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 30-40% in diabetic mice, with stronger results at higher doses. It also improved insulin sensitivity by roughly 50% compared with untreated animals. In addition to these improvements, the extract balanced cholesterol and lowered oxidative stress markers by as much as 60%, a rare feat for any single therapeutic compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fruit of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, long used in traditional medicine, showed strong potential to fight insulin resistance and restore healthy metabolism in diabetic mice. The plant extract not only helped stabilize blood sugar but also corrected several related issues, including abnormal fat metabolism and oxidative stress. These results were linked to the activation of a key cellular signaling system that regulates how the body processes glucose and energy. The discovery points to the possibility of safer, naturally derived treatments for one of the world's most widespread chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIH: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37801345/" target="_blank"&gt;Chemical Profiling of Nitraria roborowskii Kom. by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS and Their Hypolipidemic Effects in Vivo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nitraria tangutorum improves pancreatic resistance in type 2 diabetic mice via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway” by Wu Di, Xu Jiyu, Wang Luya, Wu Li, Li Jiaxin, Banma Cailang, Zhao Xiaohui, Zhang Dejun and Yue Huilan, 14 April 2025, &lt;em&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.chinjmap.com/article/doi/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613" target="_blank"&gt;DOI: 10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chinjmap.com/article/doi/10.13748/j.cnki.issn1007-7693.20240613" target="_blank"&gt;Improvement Effect of Insulin Resistance of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria Roborowskii&lt;/em&gt; Kom in Type 2 Diabetic Mice via PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;To explore hypoglycemic effect of 95% ethanol fraction of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii &lt;/em&gt;Kom(NRK-C) and its possible mechanism evaluated in the type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;METHODS&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The body weight, organ indices, blood glucose levels, serum biochemical indexes, as well as HE/PAS histopathological section were all analyzed to assess the hypoglycemic effect of NRK-C in T2DM mice induced by a high-fat diet(HFD) combined with six intraperitoneal injections of 35 mg·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of streptozotocin(STZ). The Western blotting and immunofluorescence were further applied to determine the regulatory effect of NRK-C on key signaling proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESULTS&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The fasting blood glucose levels were significantly reduced after 7 weeks of administration of NRK-C. In addition, NRK-C could also significantly improve glucose tolerance, hepatic glycogen levels, and lipid levels(total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein), and significantly reduced insulin resistance of diabetic mice, which played an important role in the antidiabetic effects. Further mechanism research demonstrated that phosphorylated PI3K expression was up-regulated and p-GSK3β expression was up-regulated after NRK-C intervention, indicating that NRK-C might exert a potential antidiabetic effect by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;All these results suggested that NRK-C might improve T2DM and had the potential to be used as an adjunctive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="as015"&gt;
&lt;div id="sp0015"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kom (NRK), with high economic and ecological value, is mainly distributed in the Qaidam Basin, China. However, research on its chemical components and bioactivities is still rare. In this study, its chemical constituents (52) including 10 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;-carboline alkaloids, nine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/cyclopeptide" target="_blank"&gt;cyclic peptides&lt;/a&gt;, three indole alkaloids, five pyrrole alkaloids, eight phenolic acids and 17 flavonoids were identified tentatively using UPLC-triple-TOF-MS/MS. Notablely, one new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;β&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;-carboline alkaloid and five new &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cyclic-peptide" target="_blank"&gt;cyclic peptides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; were confirmed using MS/MS fragmentation pathways. In addition, experiments in vitro indicated that NRK-C had strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/maltase" target="_blank"&gt;maltase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/sucrase" target="_blank"&gt;sucrase&lt;/a&gt; inhibitory activities (IC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span&gt; of 0.202 and 0.103 mg/mL, respectively). Polysaccharide tolerance experiments confirmed NRK-C (400 mg/kg) was associated with decreased postprandial blood glucose (PBG) in diabetic mice. These results suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nitraria" target="_blank"&gt;NRK&lt;/a&gt; fruit might be used as a functional ingredient in food products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The participants were scanned while watching short (ranging from 1 to 4.3 min in length) independent and Hollywood film clips that were concatenated into four videos of 11.9–13.7 min total length. Before each clip, and after the final clip was displayed, there were 20 s periods in which there was no auditory stimulation and only the word ‘REST’ presented on the screen. There were four separate functional runs, in which observers viewed each of the four separate videos. All four videos contained an identical 83 s ‘validation’ sequence at the end of the video that was later removed to ensure independent stimulation in each cross-validation fold. Audio was scaled to ensure that no video clips were too loud or quiet across sessions and was delivered by Sensimetric earbuds that provide high-quality acoustic stimulus delivery while attenuating scanner noise. The participants also took part in one hour of resting state scans, also split into four runs of equal (around 15 min) length.

For each run, BOLD time-series data were then converted to percentage signal change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For purposes of cross-validation, we made training and test datasets from the full dataset. We removed the final 103 s of each functional run, which corresponded to the identical ‘validation’ sequence and final rest period at the end of each video run. Our training dataset therefore consisted of the concatenated data from the four functional runs with this final 103 s removed from each. The test dataset was created by concatenating the final 103 s from each run into a 412 s set of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All connective-field models were fit on the individual-participant data and for video watching these models were also fit to the data of an across time-course averaged (HCP average) participant. Split-half participant averages (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 87) were also created through a random 50% split of individual-participant data. Split-half video averages were created by creating separate datasets based on the first (videos 1 and 2) and second half (videos 3 and 4) of the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Dual-source connective-field model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec12"&gt;Model maps of V1 and S1 topography&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses extend the approach of connective-field modelling, wherein responses throughout the brain are modelled as deriving from a ‘field’ of activity on the surface of a ‘source’ region—classically V1. In turn, preferences for positions on the visual field can be estimated by referencing the estimated connective-field V1 positions against the retinotopic map of V1 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig1"&gt;1a–c&lt;/a&gt;). Here we extend this approach by simultaneously modelling brain responses as deriving from connective fields on both the V1 and S1 surfaces. This requires defining both a V1 and S1 source region and their underlying topographic maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To define these V1 and S1 source regions, we defined subsurfaces (one for each hemisphere) from the full cortical mesh, containing the vertices of a multimodal parcellation of the HCP data for regions V1 and Brodmann area 3b&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Glasser, M.

We chose region 3b as it is the first cortical input stage for tactile processing and is the most topographically organized subregion of S1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide a model retinotopic map for V1, we used data from a ‘retinotopic prior’ that defines participant-averaged parameters of preferred visual field position (eccentricity, polar angle) estimated from a population receptive field (pRF) analysis of the HCP data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Benson, N.

Thus every vertex in V1 was associated with an eccentricity and polar angle value that defined its preference for the corresponding position in the visual field. Using this data, the V1 subsurface was then curtailed to only include vertices within the region stimulated by the video display (within 8 degrees of visual angle (DVA) from the fovea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The known topographic organization of S1 is a somatotopic map, which is an approximately dorsomedially to ventrolaterally oriented gradient that runs from sensitivity to lower limbs to the upper limbs and face&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Saadon-Grosman, N., Loewenstein, Y. &amp;amp; Arzy, S.

In principle, one can approximate any arbitrary spatial pattern on the surface (that is, a connective field) through a linear combination of LBOEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate this approach and determine the number of LBOEs to use in our analysis, we conducted pilot analyses where we attempted to predict target Gaussian connective fields of varying sizes from linear combinations of LBOEs. These analyses indicated that for both V1 and S1, 200 LBOEs were sufficient to adequately predict connective fields with a sampling extent of 2 mm, which approximates the lower bound of the known sampling extent of extrastriate cortex from V1 (that is, in V2)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Haak, K.

Reconstruction performance was at near-ceiling levels for sampling extents of 4 mm and above (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig7"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig8"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) and increasing the number of LBOEs from 200 led to trivial increases in reconstruction performance relative to the increases in computation time. Furthermore, visualizing the performance of a 200 LBOE model in predicting connective fields centred on each V1 and S1 vertex revealed no systematic spatial inhomogeneities (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig7"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig8"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). As such we opted to use 200 LBOEs per subsurface in our connective-field modelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this approach validated, we generated model time courses for our design matrix via the dot product of the time-course data corresponding to each subsurface and each of the 200 corresponding LBOEs. Each model time course therefore reflects the sum of the timeseries data within the subsurface, weighted by one of the LBOEs (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;). The model time courses were then &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scored over time and stacked to form a design matrix for model fitting. Thus, there were 800 regressors in our design matrix: 400 from V1 and 400 from S1 (200 per hemisphere), which were used to explain the BOLD responses during resting-state and video watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;Model fitting&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All model fitting was conducted in Python, exploiting the routines implemented by the ‘Himalaya’ package&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="la Tour, T.

Banded ridge regression expands on these techniques by estimating a separate &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; for separate feature spaces &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; of the design matrix &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;—thereby optimizing regularization strengths independently for each feature space (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;). Banded ridge regression therefore respects the fact that different feature spaces in the design matrix may differ in covariance structure, number of features and prediction performance—entailing different optimal regularization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present case, our two feature spaces consisted of the visual and somatosensory modalities or, equivalently, the 400 V1 and S1 model time courses (X&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, X&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) described in the previous section. Thus, to model brain activity of a particular voxel, banded-ridge regression computes the weights &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, as defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${b}^{* }=\mathop{{\rm{argmin}}}\limits_{b}{\Vert \sum _{i}{X}_{i}{b}_{i}-y\Vert }_{2}^{2}+\sum _{i}{\lambda }_{i}{\Vert {b}_{i}\Vert }_{2}^{2}.$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly to unbanded ridge regression, the ridge weights &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are estimated from the training data and the hyperparameters &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are learned through cross validation. In the present case, our training data consisted of four runs of functional data in which the participants watched an independent video. This natural organization of the data enabled us to use a leave-one-video-out cross-validation strategy to estimate &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Connective-field estimation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a given voxel, the coefficients &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; estimated by the banded ridge regression model can be interpreted as the cross-validated importance of each model time course in the design matrix in explaining its response throughout the experiment (rest or video watching). By extension, as each model time course derives from an orthogonal spatial profile on the surface of V1 or S1, this means that &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; also implicitly estimates the importance of each of the underlying spatial profiles. Accordingly, for any given voxel, the dot product of its estimated &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and the corresponding spatial profiles &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; reveals a spatial map of the importance of each vertex on S1 and V1 in explaining the voxels response—or equivalently—it estimates its visual and somatosensory ‘connective field’ (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, this method of connective-field estimation is more flexible than ‘classic’ connective-field estimation procedure as it removes the constraint that the connective-field profile is a Gaussian defined by a centre (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and extent (&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;), and can estimate non-canonical or irregular spatial patterns that do not resemble unimodal and circularly symmetric Gaussians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this form of connective-field modelling through banded ridge regression is highly extensible as it can incorporate additional source regions with different topographic formats (for example, primary motor cortex, primary auditory cortex) simply through expansion of the feature spaces and bands in the design matrix. Banded ridge regression is particularly suitable in this context of multiple, potentially correlated feature spaces, as the estimation of multiple regularization parameters also leads to implicit feature selection&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="la Tour, T. D., Eickenberg, M., Nunez-Elizalde, A. O. &amp;amp; Gallant, J. L. Feature-space selection with banded ridge regression.

During cross-validation, banded ridge regression is able to learn to ignore some feature spaces to improve generalization performance. To ignore an uninformative feature space, banded ridge regression penalizes its influence by assigning a large regularization hyperparameter &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, implying that the coefficients &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are shrunk toward zero. This process effectively removes uninformative feature spaces from the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We note that great care should be taken when interpreting connective-field modelling outcomes in regions directly abutting the source region. This is because results in these neighbouring regions are likely to be biased by partial-voluming effects: in this case, a connective field centred in the source region spuriously samples from the neighbouring target region itself across the border. This contamination can be due to several factors, among which the fact that single voxels can sample grey matter on both sides of the boundary on the surface (or across both banks of a sulcus), the broad scale of spatial autocorrelations of the underlying responses and the BOLD point-spread of around 2 mm, more than the voxel size in the acquisitions used here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Connectivity-derived retinotopic and somatotopic mapping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With connective-field profiles estimated for each vertex, preferred visual field and body positions were estimated by taking the dot product of each S1 and V1 connective field and the corresponding somatotopic and retinotopic map (see the ‘Model maps of V1 and S1 topography’ section) and then dividing by the sum of the connective fields (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig6"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;). As the values of the connective-field profile represent the importance of each location on the source region in explaining a given voxels response, this is akin to a weighted averaging, whereby the retinotopic/somatotopic maps are averaged in a manner weighted by the predictive performance at each location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the ability of our model to simultaneously estimate retinotopic and somatotopic maps, we compared our connective-field-derived maps to independent maps derived from exogenous stimulation. For an exogenously derived retinotopic map, we leveraged the retinotopic prior previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Benson, N.

The participant-wise &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights for each of 12 body parts were nearest-neighbour resampled into the same 59,000 vertex per hemisphere space as the HCP data. We then conducted a second-level GLM on these beta weights and then took the dot-product of the resulting group-average betas and their ordinal position on the S1 homunculus, resulting in a continuous toe–tongue metric of body part sensitivity. Note that, before the dot product operation, we averaged the leg &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weight across left and right leg movements, as only this body part was represented bilaterally in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Correlating our connectivity-derived topographic maps with these exogenous maps, we confirm that our outcomes recovered detailed somatotopic and retinotopic organization that closely mirrors those derived from exogenous stimulation. Notably, even in medial and insular regions, where the performance of the connective-field model is relatively low, many features of the exogenously derived somatotopic maps are clearly present in our own (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig10"&gt;5e–h&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Analysis of subfields within S1&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explicitly relate our connective-field coordinates to body parts, we leveraged the definitions of four topographic body part fields within our S1 source region (3b) provided previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Glasser, M.

We corroborated the validity of these four subfields with data from the whole-brain somatotopy dataset described in the previous section.

This measure therefore provides an estimate of the importance of each body part field in driving responses within the vertex, which we then compared between somatosensory regions of interest (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig9"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Model performance metrics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dual specification of our model with multiple feature spaces also enables us to disentangle the contribution of each feature space (sensory modality) to overall prediction performance.

This means that, although the corrected values are no longer interpretable as variance explained, they reflect the superiority of the generalization performance of a spatial connective-field model relative to a non-spatial model. This correction therefore conservatively assesses the presence of true topographic connectivity by referencing against an explicit null model.

For visualization and analysis of group-level results (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;), we thresholded according to vertex locations that have significant topographic connectivity according to a one sample &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (see above). Any areas in which the group-level topographic connectivity is significantly greater than 0 are shown on the plot (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05). This measure is more conservative than &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as it is a cross-validated performance measure explicitly referenced against a null model. We note that this thresholding procedure yields regions previously defined as being somatotopic and parameter estimates from these regions agree well with conventionally defined estimates derived from exogenous stimulation (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig10"&gt;5e–h&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all somatotopic regions analysed in this manuscript survived multiple-comparisons correction using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE), which controls for family-wise error while accounting for spatial correlations in the data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Smith, S. &amp;amp; Nichols, T.

Rather than applying an initial cluster-forming threshold, TFCE integrates evidence for cluster-like structure across all possible thresholds by weighting both the height of the statistic and the spatial extent of signal support. Specifically, topographic connectivity scores were first converted into TFCE scores, which were then compared against a null distribution generated by random sign-flips across participants. For each permutation, the TFCE transformation was recomputed and the maximum TFCE value retained, yielding a null distribution of 2,000 maximum scores. The observed TFCE scores were then conservatively evaluated against this null distribution, with corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values derived from the corresponding quantiles (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01, two-tailed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individual-participant outcomes, we used procedures that mirrored those of the HCP 7 T retinotopy pipeline&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Benson, N.

Vis. 18, 23–23 (2018)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#ref-CR66" id="ref-link-section-d86052832e2636"&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For each modality-split variance-explained score (visual, somatosensory), we determined a threshold by fitting a Gaussian mixture model with two Gaussians to the distribution of variance explained values across vertices (excluding source regions) and then identified the value at which the posterior probability switches from the Gaussian with the lower mean to that with the higher mean. The interpretation of this procedure is that the Gaussian with a lower mean is likely to reflect noise (vertices that are not responsive to visual or somatosensory information), the Gaussian with larger mean is likely to reflect signal (vertices that are sensitive to visual or somatosensory information) and values above the threshold are more likely to reflect signal than noise. This procedure resulted in a visual variance explained threshold of 2.4% and a somatosensory variance explained threshold of 1.9%, which are very close to those used for the HCP retinotopy data (2.2%). The application of this procedure to the HCP average participant yielded a threshold of 10% for the somatosensory modality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the consistency in sensitivity to visual and somatosensory information at the individual level, we summed the number of participants for whom both modalities were above threshold at each vertex location (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt;). To statistically evaluate the likelihood of obtaining the observed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; under a null hypothesis (no systematic co-localization of tuning across individuals), we performed a permutation-based cluster analysis. First, we decomposed the cortical surface for each hemisphere into 400 LBOEs and used these spatial profiles as a design matrix for a regression model that predicted the presence of above threshold somatosensory tuning at each cortical location (0 = below threshold, 1 = above threshold). We next used the resulting &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights to predict 1,000 new, surrogate maps of somatosensory tuning by randomizing their sign prior to the dot product with the design matrix. The resulting maps therefore had the same spatial frequency profile as the empirical data but with randomized structure in cortical space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each surrogate somatosensory map, we calculated the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; at each vertex location and submitted this to a cluster analysis, whereby clusters were defined as contiguous sets of vertices with at least 96 participants above threshold for both modalities at that location (upper binomial limit for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 174, &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05). We then retained the maximum cluster-wise summed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; as a test statistic and concatenated these across surrogate maps to form a null distribution. The same clustering procedure was performed on the empirical data and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were obtained by calculating the proportion of the null distribution that was lower than the summed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; in each empirical cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting data are shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig12"&gt;7a,b&lt;/a&gt;.

Other, smaller clusters were observed in the superior temporal lobe and frontally, including one overlapping with the frontal eye field. The profile of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;vs&lt;/sup&gt; also revealed a small ‘hotspot’ of reliably above-threshold tuning in posterior parietal cortex, which may correspond to the visuotactile map described previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Sereno, M.

Individual-participant topographic connectivity scores were resampled with replacement 10,000 times to generate resampled datasets with random samples of participants. For each resampled dataset, we quantified the percentage of voxels within each somatosensory ROI with topographic connectivity scores significantly greater than zero. In this calculation, note that the source region of the analysis (3b) is excluded. Reported CIs were obtained from the quantiles (2.5% and 97.5%) of the resulting distribution of percentage coverage estimates. The same bootstrapping approach was applied to assess the correlation of somatotopic connectivity scores with functional localizer data from the NSD dataset, for which we used the same group-level &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistics described above. Using the correlation between somatotopic connectivity scores and the ‘body v all other categories’ &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistics as a reference, we subtracted the correlation with the corresponding place, face and object &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-statistics across 10,000 bootstrapped samples.

As such, the statistical significance of agreement between maps is likely to be inflated and violate independence assumptions. Thus, rather than relying on the statistical significance of these empirical agreement statistics alone, they require benchmarking against surrogate data that quantifies the statistical expectations under a null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, we first used the somatotopic map estimated for the cutout region in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt; from one split-half of participants to predict the corresponding data from the other split-half. The resulting &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value was retained as an empirical test statistic. To generate a null distribution of these statistics, we generated 10,000 ‘surrogate’ homuncular maps from each split-half of participant data. These were generated by taking the estimated &lt;i&gt;b*&lt;/i&gt; corresponding to each of the LBOEs of the S1 subsurface, randomizing their sign and recomputing the S1 connective field. This manipulation generates randomized connective fields that preserve the same amplitude spectra (distribution of energy across frequency) as the empirical data. For each surrogate dataset, we then computed its performance in predicting the out of set empirical somatotopic map and retained the proportion of these statistics that exceeded the empirical value as a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value. This process was repeated for the second participant split and the resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were summed to obtain a final measure of the probability of obtaining the empirical statistic under the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Visual body-part selectivity estimates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate a map of visual body-part selectivity, we leveraged data from the NSD, also collected at 7 T (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Allen, E.

Openpose detects the location of 17 different keypoints (nose, left eye, right eye, left ear, right ear, left shoulder, right shoulder, left elbow, right elbow, left wrist, right wrist, left hip, right hip, left knee, right knee, left ankle, right ankle). Thus, each image in the COCO dataset is associated with 17 binary variables that codes the presence of each keypoint for every human entity within the image. Critically, the subset of COCO images used in the NSD dataset were spatially cropped relative to the original versions for which the keypoints were computed. We therefore recoded keypoints that were coded as present in the original COCO images but resided outside of the NSD crop-box as being 0 (absent). For each image and body part, we calculated the average of the binary variable for each keypoint across entities to give an estimate of the frequency with which the body part was present within entities within the image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we converted these scores into a regressor that explicitly coded selective responses for each body part. For each body part, we calculated a selectivity score defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${X}_{{\rm{B}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{t}}}={\rm{B}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}\times ({N}_{{\rm{B}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{d}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{P}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{r}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{A}}{\rm{b}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{e}}})$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this calculation, for example, an image with the presence of an ankle and the absence of all other body parts generates the highest score for the ankle selectivity regressor. Conversely, the score will be implicitly penalized as a function of the number of other (non-ankle) body parts that are visible. These regressors for each body part were stacked into a design matrix. This formed the basis of a forward model of visual body selectivity, of which the parameters were estimated by ridge regression. The model was trained on 10 of the runs of data through &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-fold cross-validation and was tested on the final 2. For each voxel, body part preference was defined as the dot product of the resulting &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights and their ordinal position in the S1 homunculus (ankle to nose) providing a continuous map of visual body part selectivity along a similar toe–tongue axis as the somatotopy data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Searchlight analyses: permutation test&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the cutout region in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; we defined geodesic ‘chunks’ of cortex that were centred at each vertex with a radius of 8 mm. To generate empirical statistics, within each one of these chunks we computed the correlation between the somatotopic map shown in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and the target data (vertical visual field position in retinotopic map or visual body part selectivity map). To generate a null distribution of these statistics, we leveraged the same 10,000 phase-scrambled surrogate homuncular maps (see the ‘Robustness of extrastriate somatotopic maps: permutation test’ section) and, for each one, we calculated the corresponding correlations with the target data in each chunk. This distribution of local chunk-wise correlations obtained across all surrogate somatotopic maps served as our null distribution of local correlations. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for the correlations within each empirical chunk were obtained as the probability of obtaining such extreme statistics from this null distribution. Note that, for the analysis of the retinotopy data, we excluded chunks for which the range of the estimated visual field positions was less than 1 DVA and therefore had little retinotopic variation. The resulting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were then projected into the spatial locations of their corresponding chunk and the data were then averaged across hemispheres to produce the data in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig5"&gt;5e,i&lt;/a&gt;. Note that as the chunks contained partially overlapping data, the data in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; show the lowest &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value obtained at each vertex location. In addition to the results reported in the main text, we performed additional analyses that correlated the eccentricity parameter of the retinotopy data with the somatotopic map. This revealed a region overlapping with IPS0 and IPS1 wherein more foveal locations were tuned to facial features and more eccentric locations tuned to limbs (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig13"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Alternative model: field-based connective-field model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that S1 is not a continuous somatotopic map, but consists of discrete body-part fields, defined on the basis of resting state connectivity, myelin and functional data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="Kuehn, E. et al.

Accordingly, a model that assumes discontinuous connectivity at the boundary of such fields, rather than continuous connectivity along the 3b surface, may provide a viable alternative account of the data. To explicitly test this organizing influence of body part fields, we compared our full connective-field model that uses all of 3b as a source region to 4 alternative connective field models (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09796-0#Fig13"&gt;8e&lt;/a&gt;), each with restricted source regions corresponding to the lower limb, trunk, upper limb and face fields, following the definitions described in the ‘Analysis of subfields within the S1’ section. To ensure validity of such a comparison, we determined the number of LBOEs in each of these restricted source regions sufficient to reconstruct 4 mm Gaussian connective fields at near-ceiling performance (determined by the minimum &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being above 0.98 across vertex locations). This implied 70 LBOEs each for the lower limb, trunk and face fields, and 50 for the upper limb field. These alternative models were then fit using identical procedures described for the full model. For each vertex location, we then selected the cross-validated somatosensory &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from the best performing restricted model and subtracted it from that of the full model, yielding a Δ&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases have risen in the United States in recent weeks, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 14% of tests for the illness came back positive during the week that ended on Nov. 15, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. Over 2,700 tests were conducted that week, according to the CDC, meaning that about 380 cases of norovirus were diagnosed in that period.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's more than double the percentage of positive tests recorded about three months ago, when test positivity in the U.S. this year was at its lowest. The week that ended on Aug. 9 saw a 6.53% positivity rate of more than 4,240 tests conducted during that period, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test positivity is an imperfect metric because it can vary based on the number of tests conducted. The CDC's data is based on reports from participating laboratories, hospitals and health departments. Test positivity rates can help provide general data about what diseases are circulating and when, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus, sometimes known as the stomach bug or stomach flu, is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the leading cause of foodborne illness, the agency says on its website. Norovirus is extremely contagious and causes symptoms including nausea, belly pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Most people experience symptoms for one to three days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people are sickened with norovirus every year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;, and about 2,500 outbreaks of norovirus are reported in the U.S. each year. The illness results in over 100,000 hospitalizations and about 900 deaths per year. Adults 65 and older are the most likely to die from norovirus, the CDC said. Young children and those with compromised immune systems are also at a higher risk for severe illness or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of norovirus are most common between November and April, the CDC says. Last winter, the U.S. saw a major surge of norovirus, with a more than 25% test positivity rate &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-wave-twice-last-year-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recorded in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, earlier this month, a potential outbreak prompted a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/wilson-middle-school-closed-potential-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Michigan middle school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to close for a day for deep cleaning after dozens of students &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/norovirus-cases-on-the-rise-what-to-know-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reported feeling ill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Nearly 100 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/norovirus-outbreak-on-cruise-ship-sickens-nearly-100-people/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cruise ship passengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were sickened by norovirus in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing hands frequently, safely handling and preparing food, and regularly cleaning surfaces can help prevent norovirus from spreading, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is also contagious after symptoms end, so people should continue these precautions for at least two days after they begin to feel better, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

Monkeys Si and Ch were between 8 and 11 years old and weighed approximately 12.7 and 10.7 kg, respectively. All of the experimental procedures were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol, 3055) and were in accordance with the policies and procedures of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec10"&gt;Behavioural task&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each trial began with the monkeys fixating on a dot at the centre of the screen. During a fixation period lasting 500 ms–800 ms, the monkeys were required to keep their gaze within a circle with a radius of 3.25 degrees of visual angle around the fixation dot. After the fixation period, the stimulus and all four response locations were simultaneously displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimuli were morphs consisting of both a colour and shape (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;). The stimuli were rendered as three-dimensional models using POV-Ray and MATLAB (MathWorks) and displayed using Psychtoolbox on a Dell U2413 LCD monitor positioned 58 cm from the animal. Stimuli were morphed along circular continua in both colour and shape (that is, drawn from a four-dimensional ‘Clifford’ torus; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;). Colours were drawn from a photometrically isoluminant circle in the CIELAB colour space, connecting the red and green prototype colours. Shapes were created by circularly interpolating the parameters defining the lobes of the ‘bunny’ prototype to the parameters defining the corresponding lobes of the ‘tee’ prototype. The mathematical representation of the morph levels adhered to the equation &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({X}_{1}^{2}+{X}_{2}^{2}+{X}_{3}^{2}={P}^{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; where &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; represents the parameter value in a feature dimension (for example, &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; values in CIELAB colour space). We chose the radius (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) to ensure sufficient visual discriminability between morph levels. The deviation of each morph level from prototypes (0% and 100%) was quantified using percentage, corresponding to positions on the circular space from −π to 0 and 0 to π. Morph levels were generated at eight levels: 0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%, 70%, 50%, 30%, corresponding to 0, π/6, π/2, 5π/6, π, −5π/6, −π/2 and −π/6, respectively. 50% morph levels for one feature were only generated for prototypes of the other feature (that is, 50% colours were only used with 0% or 100% shape stimuli and vice versa). Stimuli were presented at fixation and had a diameter of 2.5 degrees of visual angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkeys indicated the colour or shape category of the stimulus by saccading to one of the four response locations, positioned 6 degrees of visual angle from the fixation point at 45, 135, 225 and 315 degrees, relative to the vertical line. The reaction time was taken as the moment of leaving the fixation window relative to the time of stimulus onset. Trials with a reaction time below 150 ms were terminated, followed by a brief timeout (200 ms). Correct responses were rewarded with juice, while incorrect responses resulted in short timeouts lasting 1 s for monkey Ch and 5 s for monkey Si. After the trial finished, there was an intertrial interval lasting 2–2.5 s before the next trial began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals performed three category-response tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1c&lt;/a&gt;). The S1 task required the monkeys to categorize the stimulus by its shape. For a stimulus with a shape that was closer to the ‘bunny’ prototype, the animals had to make a saccade to the UL location to get rewarded. For a stimulus with a shape closer to the ‘tee’ prototype, the animals had to make a saccade to the LR location to be rewarded. For ease of notation, we refer to the combination of the UL and LR target locations as axis 1. The C1 task required the monkeys to categorize the stimulus by its colour. When a stimulus’ colour was closer to ‘red’, the animals made an eye movement to the LR location and when it was closer to ‘green’ the animals made an eye movement to the UL location. Finally, in the C2 task, the monkeys again categorized stimuli based on their colour but responded to the UR location for red stimuli and the LL location for green stimuli. Together, the UR and LL targets formed axis 2. This set of three tasks was designed to be related to one another: the C1 and C2 tasks both required categorizing the colour of the stimulus while the C1 and S1 tasks both required responding on axis 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monkeys were not explicitly cued as to which task was in effect. However, they did perform the same task for a block of trials allowing the animal to infer the task based on the combination of stimulus, response and reward feedback. Tasks switched when the monkeys’ performance reached or exceeded 70% on the last 102 trials of task S1 and task C1 or the last 51 trials of task C2. For monkey Si, block switches occurred when their performance reached or exceeded the 70% threshold for all morphed and prototype stimuli in the relevant task dimension independently. For monkey Ch, block switches occurred when their average performance at each morph level in the relevant task dimension exceeded the 70% threshold (that is, average of all 30% morphs, average of all 70% morphs, and 0% and 100% prototypes in colour dimension were all equal or greater than 70% accuracy in the C1 and C2 tasks). Moreover, on a subset of recording days, to prevent monkey Ch from perseverating on one task for an extended period of time, the threshold was reduced to 65% over the last 75 trials for S1 and C1 tasks after the monkey had already done 200 or 300 trials on that block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the animal hit the performance threshold, the task switched. This was indicated by a flashing yellow screen, a few drops of reward and a delay of 50 s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure even sampling of tasks despite the limited number of trials each day, the axis of response always changed following a block switch. During axis 1 blocks, either S1 task or C1 task was pseudorandomly selected, interleaved with C2 task blocks. Pseudorandom selection within axis 1 blocks avoided three consecutive blocks of the same task, ensuring the animal performed at least one block of each task during each session. On average, animals performed of 560, 558 and 301 trials and 2.68, 2.77 and 5.4 blocks per day for the S1, C1 and C2 tasks, respectively. Task orders and trial conditions were randomized across trials within each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkeys Si and Ch underwent training for 36 and 60 months, respectively. Both animals were trained in the same order of tasks: S1, C2 and then C1. Each animal underwent exposure to every task manipulation. As all of the animals were allocated to a single experimental group, blinding was neither necessary nor feasible during behavioural training. Electrophysiological recordings began when the monkeys consistently executed five or more blocks daily. Further details on the behavioural methods and results have been previously reported&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Bouchacourt, F., Tafazoli, S., Mattar, M.

By contrast, stimuli in the red-bunny and green-tee portion of stimulus space were ‘incongruent’, as they required different responses during the two tasks (UL and LR in S1 task; LR and UL in C1 task, respectively). To ensure the animals performed the task well, 80% of the trials included incongruent stimuli. Note that, as the C2 task was the only one to use axis 2, there were no congruent or incongruent stimuli on those blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Analysis of behavioural data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychometric curves plot the fraction of trials in which the animals classified a stimulus with a specific morph level as being a member of the ‘green’ category for the C1 and C2 tasks or the ‘tee’ category for the S1 task. The fraction of responses for a given morph level of the task-relevant stimulus dimension was averaged across all morph levels of the task-irrelevant dimension during the last 102/102/51 trials of the S1/C1/C2 task (for example, for the C1 task, the fraction of responses for 70% green stimuli were averaged across all shape morph levels). As the stimulus space was circular, we averaged the behavioural response for the two stimuli at each morph level on each side of the circle (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;). Psychometric curves were quantified by fitting the mean datapoints with a modified Gauss error function (erf):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$F=\theta +\lambda \times \left(\mathrm{erf}\,(\frac{x-\mu }{\sigma })+1\right)/2,$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where erf is the error function, &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; is a vertical bias parameter, &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; is a squeeze factor, &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; is a threshold, and &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt; is a slope parameter. Fitting was done in MATLAB with the maximum likelihood method (fminsearch.m function).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate performance during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;), we used a sliding window of 15 trials, stepped 1 trial, to calculate a running average of performance immediately after a switch or right before a switch. Performance was estimated using trials from all blocks of the same task, regardless of the identity of the stimulus. To test whether behavioural performance differed significantly between the C1–C2–C1 and S1–C2–C1 sequences during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;; S1–C2–S1 or C1–C2–S1 in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig13"&gt;8a&lt;/a&gt; and C1–C2 or S1–C2 in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig13"&gt;8b&lt;/a&gt;), we applied &lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; test using the chi2test.m function as implemented previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Axensten, P. chi2test (MATLAB Central File Exchange, 2007);

Chamber positions were determined using 3D model reconstruction of the skull and brain using structural MRI scans. We recorded neurons from the LPFC (Brodmann area 46 d and 46 v, 480 neurons), aIT (area TEa, 239 neurons), PAR (Brodmann area 7, 64 neurons), the FEF (Brodmann area 8, 149 neurons) and the striatum (STR, caudate nucleus, 149 neurons).

To record from the LPFC and FEF we used epoxy-coated tungsten single electrodes (FHC). Pairs of single electrodes were placed in a custom-built grid with manual micromanipulators that lowered electrode pairs using a screw. This enabled us to record 20–30 neurons simultaneously from cortical areas near the surface. To record from deeper regions (PAR, aIT and STR) we used 16ch or 32ch Plexon V-Probes (Plexon). These probes were lowered using the same custom-built grid through guide tubes. During lowering, we used both structural MRI scans and the characteristics of the electrophysiological signal to track the position of the electrode. A custom-made MATLAB GUI tracked electrode depth during the recording session and marked important landmarks until we found the brain region of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings were acute; up to 50 single electrodes and three V-Probes were inserted into the brain each day (in some recording sessions one additional V-Probe was also inserted in the LPFC). Single electrodes and V-probes were lowered though the intact dura at the beginning of recording session and allowed to settle for 2–3 h before recording, improving the stability of recordings. Neurons were recorded without bias. Electrodes were positioned to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the electrophysiological signal without consideration of neural type or selectivity. Experimenters were blinded to experimental conditions while recording neurons. We did not simultaneously record from all five regions in all recording sessions. We began recording from the LPFC and FEF for the first 5–10 days and then added PAR, STR and aIT on successive days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadband neural activity was recorded at 40 kHz using a 128-channel OmniPlex recording system (Plexon). We performed 15 recording sessions with monkey Ch and 19 recording sessions with monkey Si. After all recordings were complete, we used electrical microstimulation in monkey Si, and structural MRI and microstimulation in monkey Ch, to identify the FEF. Electrical stimulation was delivered as a train of anodal-leading biphasic pulses with a width of 400 µs and an interpulse frequency of 330 Hz. A site was identified as the FEF when electrical microstimulation of around 50 µA evoked a stereotyped eye-movement on at least 50% of the stimulation attempts. In monkey Ch, untested electrode locations were classified as FEF if they fell between two FEF sites (as confirmed with electrical stimulation) in a region that was confirmed as being FEF using MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye position was recorded at 1 kHz using an Eyelink 1000 Plus eye-tracking system (SR Research). Sample onset was recorded using a photodiode attached to the screen. Eye position, photodiode signal and behavioural events generated during the task were all recorded alongside neural activity in the OmniPlex system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;Signal preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiological signals were filtered using a 4-pole high pass 300 Hz Butterworth filter. To reduce common noise, the median of the signals recorded from all single electrodes in each chamber was subtracted from the activity of all single electrodes. For V-Probe recordings, we subtracted the median activity for all channels along the probe from each channel. To detect spike waveforms, a 4&lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; threshold was used where &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is an estimate of s.d. of noise distribution of signal &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; defined as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\sigma }_{n}=\mathrm{median}\,\left(\frac{|x|}{0.6745}\right)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timepoints at which the electrophysiological signal (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) crossed this threshold with a negative slope were identified as putative spiking events. Spike waveforms were saved (total length was 44 samples, 1.1 ms, of which 16 samples, 0.4 ms, were pre-threshold). Repeated threshold crossing within 48 samples (1.2 ms) was excluded. All waveforms recorded from a single channel were manually sorted into single units, multiunit activity or noise using Plexon Offline Sorter (Plexon). Units that were partially detected during a recording session were also excluded. Experimenters were blinded to the experimental conditions while sorting waveforms into individual neurons. All analyses reported in this Article were performed on single units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all reported electrophysiology analysis, saccade time was calculated as the moment at which the instantaneous eye speed exceeded a threshold of 720 degrees of visual angle per second. Instantaneous eye speed was calculated as &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\sqrt{{\left(\frac{{\rm{d}}x}{{\rm{d}}t}\right)}^{2}+{\left(\frac{{\rm{d}}y}{{\rm{d}}t}\right)}^{2}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; are the position of the eye on the monitor at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Statistics and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent experiments were performed on two monkeys and the data were combined for subsequent analyses. As described below, statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using two-tailed cluster correction unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise noted, nonparametric tests were performed using 1,000 iterations; therefore, exact &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are specified when &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.001. Unless stated otherwise, all data were smoothed with a 150 ms boxcar. To compare the onset timing differences between within and shared-colour representations across brain regions (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2g&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig11"&gt;6d&lt;/a&gt;), classifier accuracy for each region was smoothed using a 50 ms boxcar filter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All analyses were performed in MATLAB 2021b (MathWorks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Using cluster mass to correct for multiple comparisons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the significance of observed clusters in the time series data, we used a two-tailed cluster mass correction method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Maris, E. &amp;amp; Oostenveld, R. Nonparametric statistical testing of EEG- and MEG-data. J. Neurosci. Methods 164, 177–190 (2007)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#ref-CR60" id="ref-link-section-d99810997e2379"&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with multiple comparisons and helps identify clusters of contiguous timepoints that exhibit statistically significant deviations from the null distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first generated a null distribution (NullDist) by shuffling the observed data, breaking the relationship between the neural signal and the task parameter of interest (details of how data were shuffled are included with each test below). The observed data were also included as a ‘shuffle’ in the null distribution and the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score of the null distribution for each timepoint was calculated. To define significant moments in time, we computed the upper and lower thresholds based on the null distribution. The thresholds were determined non-parametrically using percentiles. The resulting thresholds, denoted as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;threshold upper&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;threshold lower&lt;/sub&gt;, serve as critical values for identifying significant deviations in both tails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timepoints of significant signal were identified by finding the moments when the value in each shuffle within the null distribution or the observed data exceeded the computed thresholds. These timepoints were then clustered in time, such that contiguous values above the threshold were summed together. The sum was calculated on the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-transformed values of each time series. This resulted in a mass of each contiguous cluster in the data. To correct for multiple comparisons, we took the maximum absolute value of the cluster mass across time for each shuffle. This resulted in a distribution of maximum cluster masses. Finally, the two-tailed &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of each cluster in the observed data was determined by comparing its mass to the distribution of maximum cluster masses in the null distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;FR calculation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all analyses, we estimated the FR of each neuron by averaging the number of action potentials within a 100 ms window, stepping the window every 10 ms. Changing the width of the smoothing window did not qualitatively change our results. The time labels in the figures denote the trailing edge of this moving window (that is, 0 ms would be a window from 0 ms to 100 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;GLM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate how individual neurons represented task variables, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) to relate the activity of each neuron (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;) to the task variables at each moment of time. The full model was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ3" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$y={\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{1}\times \mathrm{stimulus}\,\mathrm{colour}\,\mathrm{category}+{\beta }_{2}\times \mathrm{stimulus}\,\mathrm{shape}\,\mathrm{category}+{\beta }_{3}\times \mathrm{time}+{\beta }_{4}\times \mathrm{task}\,\mathrm{identity}+{\beta }_{5}\times \mathrm{motor}\,\mathrm{response}\,\mathrm{direction}+{\beta }_{6}\times \mathrm{reward}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; is the FR of each neuron, normalized to the maximum FR across all trials, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are the regression coefficients corresponding to each predictor. Predictors were: stimulus colour category, indicating the colour category of the stimulus (categorical variable); stimulus shape category, indicating the shape category of the stimulus (categorical variable); time, indicating the temporal progression within a recording session, normalized between 0 and 1 (continuous variable); task identity, indicating the identity of the task (categorical variable); motor response direction, indicating the direction of the motor response (categorical variable; UL, UR, LL or LR); reward, indicating whether a reward was received following the response (binary variable; 1 for reward, 0 for no reward).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLM coefficients (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) were estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation as implemented by MATLAB’s lassoglm.m function. Independent models were fit for each timepoint. To address potential overfitting, we applied Lasso (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) regularization to the GLM weights with regularization coefficients (lambda) values of [0, 0.0003, 0.0006, 0.0009, 0.0015, 0.0025, 0.0041, 0.0067, 0.0111, 0.0183]. In a separate set of runs, we fit the GLM models to 80% of data and tested on the remaining 20%. The lambda value with maximum &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the withheld data was used when estimating the CPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;CPD calculation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the unique contribution of each predictor to a neuron’s activity, we used the CPD. This metric quantifies the percent of explained variance that is lost when a specific factor is removed from the full model. The CPD was computed by initially fitting the GLM with all the factors (full model) as described above. Each factor was then sequentially removed to create a set of reduced models, each of which were fit to the data. The CPD for each predictor &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) was calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{CPD}(X(t))=\frac{{\mathrm{SSE}}_{\mathrm{reduced}}-{\mathrm{SSE}}_{\text{full model}}}{{\mathrm{SSE}}_{\mathrm{reduced}}}\times 100$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where SSE&lt;sub&gt;reduced&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of square error due to predictor &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;, SSE&lt;sub&gt;full model&lt;/sub&gt; is the sum of square error of the full model with all predictors&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Chiang, F.-K. &amp;amp; Wallis, J. D. Neuronal encoding in prefrontal cortex during hierarchical reinforcement learning. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 30, 1197–1208 (2018)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#ref-CR61" id="ref-link-section-d99810997e2699"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Note that, because the CPD statistic estimates the additional explained variance captured by each term, it controls for potential covariation between terms. Nevertheless, it is important to note that, as with all neurophysiological studies, it is difficult to distinguish between the encoding of a specific cognitive variable (for example, task) and its effect on the representation of other cognitive variables (for example, the observed suppression of sensory and/or motor representations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a permutation test to assess whether CPDs for each predictor, at each timepoint, and for each neuron, was significantly larger than expected by chance. To compute a null distribution for CPD for each predictor, we generated 1,000 permuted datasets by randomly permuting the predictor values relative to the neural activity and refitting the full and reduced models (as above). The likelihood of the observed CPD was then estimated by computing the proportion of permuted datasets that yielded a CPD greater than or equal to that of the observed dataset. To account for multiple comparisons across timepoints, we used cluster correction (detailed above) to estimate corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for each predictor. Neurons that had at least one significant cluster (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were considered to significantly carry information about a task variable. To assess whether an area had a significant number of neurons for a given task variable, we used a binomial test against the alpha-level 0.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1h–l&lt;/a&gt;, we compensated for a baseline CPD by subtracting the average permuted CPD from the observed CPD. For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1m&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the CPD for each factor across all recorded neurons, subtracted the average baseline in −200–0 ms as the stimulus onset period and then normalized the resulting CPD curve to its maximum value. For Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig8"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the CPD for task identity factor across all recorded neurons then normalized the resulting CPD curve to its maximum value. This highlighted the timing of different factors during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Quantifying population overlap for encoding of task variables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether task variables were encoded by overlapping neural populations (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig8"&gt;3b–k&lt;/a&gt;), we examined neurons for each task variable pair (for example, task identity and reward) to identify those that significantly encoded either or both variables using the GLM model explained above. Using a permutation test, we calculated the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value for neurons encoding both variables. For a neural population of size &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;, with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&lt;/sub&gt; neurons encoding the first task variable, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons encoding the second, and&lt;i&gt; N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&amp;amp;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons encoding both, we iterated 10,000 random samples of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;. In each iteration, we counted neurons encoding both variables. The likelihood of the observed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TaskVar1&amp;amp;TaskVar2&lt;/sub&gt; was estimated by calculating the proportion of permutations yielding an equal or greater count of neurons encoding both task variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Classifiers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how task variables were represented in the neural population, we trained a set of binary classifiers to discriminate the vector of FRs across the neural population for two different categories of task variables (depending on the variable of interest). Classifiers were trained with the logistic regression algorithm (as implemented in MATLAB, fitclinear.m function). In brief, the linear classifier relates &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; (vector of neural responses) to &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; (task labels, either +1 or −1) through a linear equation, with weights (&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) and intercept (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$f(x)={w}^{T}{\bf{x}}+b$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; are optimized to minimize the logistic loss function: &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\mathcal{L}}[y,f(x)]=\frac{-1}{N}{\sum }_{i=1}^{N}[{y}_{i}\log (f({x}_{i}))+(1-{y}_{i})\log (1-f({x}_{i}))]\,\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; is the number of samples. Ridge (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) regularization with a regularization coefficient &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; = 1/60 was used to minimize over-fitting. The classifier was trained with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Construction of pseudopopulations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All classifiers were trained on pseudopopulation of responses constructed from neurons across all recording sessions. A separate pseudopopulation was constructed for each classifier analysis based on the trial types of interest (described below). To be included in the pseudopopulation, each neuron had to be recorded for a minimum number of trials (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;train&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;test&lt;/sub&gt;) of each type of trial. The FR of neurons were concatenated to form a vector of neuron FRs (the pseudopopulation). Neural activity was aligned in time relative to either the sample onset or saccade onset, depending on the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combine neurons across recording sessions into a single ‘trial’ of the pseudopopulation, we drew trials for each neuron with matching experimental conditions (that is, matched in terms of reward, colour and shape morph level, task identity and response direction). For example, when constructing a pseudopopulation for classifying the colour category, the first trial was constructed by concatenating the neural responses of neurons on trials that were rewarded, had a colour morph level of 100 and a shape morph level of 30. If a neuron did not have a trial with an exactly matching stimulus, then a trial that matched the colour category and reward would be randomly chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Cross-validation of classifiers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate logistic regression classifier was trained and tested on withheld trials for each timepoint. To estimate variability, the entire analysis was repeated 250 times, with each iteration involving a different partition of trials into training and testing sets. This new set of trials was randomly sampled with replacement (always ensuring test trials were separate from the train trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When testing the performance of a classifier trained on the same set of conditions (for example, training and testing colour categorization on the C2 task), the performance of the classifier was taken as the average performance across tenfold cross-validation. However, as detailed in the main text, many of the classifiers were trained and tested across conditions (for example, across different tasks or across trials during learning of the task). In this case, the test trials were randomly resampled ten times for each training set, and the classifier’s performance was averaged across folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Balancing classifier conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid bias in the classifier, we balanced trial conditions to ensure the observed results were not due to other experimental factors. Conditions were balanced in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;Balanced congruency: classifiers were trained on an equal number of congruent and incongruent trials, resulting in equal number of trials for four stimulus types: green-bunny, green-tee, red-bunny and red-tee.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;Balanced reward: classifiers were trained on an equal number of rewarded and unrewarded trials, balancing the stimulus identity of the relevant dimension on each side of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(3)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;Balanced response direction: classifiers were trained on an equal number of trials from each response direction on the task’s response axis (for example, trials with response on axis 1 for the C1 task). This necessarily included error trials but balanced the number of each response direction on each side of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Classifying the colour category and shape category of stimuli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colour and shape classifiers were trained to decode the stimulus colour category or shape category from the vector of activity across the pseudopopulation of neurons (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2a,b&lt;/a&gt;). A balanced number of congruent and incongruent stimuli were included in the training data to ensure colour and shape information could be decoded independently. Classifiers were trained for each task independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most classifiers were trained on correct trials alone. This maximized the number of trials included in the analysis and ensured the animals were engaged in the task. As many of our analyses were tested across tasks, this mitigates concerns that motor response information might confound stimulus category information. However, to ensure response direction did not affect our analyses, we controlled for motor response by balancing response direction in a separate set of analysis (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig9"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5c,d&lt;/a&gt;). Although this significantly reduced the number of trials, and required us to include error trials, qualitatively similar results were often observed. The total number of LPFC, STR, aIT, PAR and FEF neurons used for colour category classification was 403, 110, 195, 54 and 116, respectively. The total numbers of LPFC, STR, aIT, PAR and FEF neurons used for shape category classification were 480, 149, 239, 64 and 149, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Classifying response direction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate set of response classifiers were trained to decode the motor response from the vector of activity across the pseudopopulation of neurons. Response direction was decoded within each axis (for example, UL versus LR for axis 1). When training and testing on the same task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2c&lt;/a&gt;), we included only trials that the animal responded on the correct axis (for example, axis 1 for the S1 and C1 tasks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For testing whether response direction could be decoded across axes (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt;), we trained the classifier using trials from task C1, where the animal responded on axis 1, and then tested this classifier using trials from task C2, where the animal responded on axis 2, and vice versa. To control for stimulus-related information, we balanced rewarded and unrewarded trials for each condition and only included incongruent trials. This ensured that trials from the same stimulus category were present in both response locations. Similar results were seen when balancing for congruency and reward simultaneously, although the low number of incorrect trials for congruent trials resulted in a small set of neurons with the minimum number of train and test trials. The total number of LPFC, STR, aIT, PAR and FEF neurons used for response direction classification was 403, 110, 195, 54 and 116, respectively. Owing to limited number of trials, the total number of LPFC neurons for Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig9"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt; was 95 (only from animal Si).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Using permutation tests to estimate the likelihood of classifier accuracy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used permutation tests to estimate the likelihood the observed classifier accuracy occurred by chance. To create a null distribution of classifier performance, we randomly permuted the labels of training data 1,000 times. Importantly, only the task-variable of interest was permuted—permutations were performed within the set of trials with the same identity of other (balanced) task variables. For example, if trials were balanced for reward, we shuffled labels within correct trials and within incorrect trials, separately. This ensured that the shuffling broke only the relationship between the task-variable of interest and the activity of neurons. Shuffling of the labels was performed independently for each neuron before building the pseudopopulation and training classifiers. Neurons that were recorded in the same session had identical shuffled labels. To stabilize the estimate of the classifier performance, the performance of the classifier on the observed and each instance of the permuted data were averaged over 10-folds and 20 to 50 novel iterations of each classifier. The null distribution was the combination of the permuted and observed values (total &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1,001). The likelihood of the observed classifier performance was then estimated as its percentile within the null distribution. As described above, we used cluster correction to control for multiple comparisons across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Testing classification across tasks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify whether the representation of colour, shape, or response direction generalized across tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2e,f,h,i&lt;/a&gt;), we trained classifiers on trials from one task and then tested the classifier on trials from another task. For example, to test cross-generalization of colour information across the C1 and C2 tasks, a colour classifier was trained on trials from the C2 task was tested on trials from the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2f&lt;/a&gt;). To remove any bias due to differences in baseline FR across tasks, we subtracted the mean FR during each task from all trials of that task (at each timepoint). Similar results were observed when we did not subtract the mean FR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;Cross-temporal classification&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure how classifiers generalized across time, we trained classifiers to discriminate colour category (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5b&lt;/a&gt;) or response direction (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig2"&gt;2h&lt;/a&gt;) using 100 ms time bins of FR data, sliding by 10 ms. Classifiers trained on each time bin were then tested on all time bins of the test trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Projection onto the encoding axis of classifier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To visualize the high-dimensional representation of task variables, we used the MATLAB predict.m function to project the FR response on test trials onto the one-dimensional encoding space defined by the vector orthogonal to the classification hyperplane. In other words, the projection measures the distance of the neural response vector to the classifier hyperplane. For example, to measure the encoding of each colour category in the C1 task, we projected the trial-by-trial FR onto the axis orthogonal to the hyperplane of the colour classifier trained during the C1 task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Quantifying the impact of task sequence on task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task-discovery period was defined as the first 110–120 trials after a switch in the task. The monkey’s performance increased during this period, as they learned which task was in effect (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig1"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt;). As described in the main text, the animal’s behavioural performance depended on the sequence of tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;) and we therefore analysed neural representations separately for two different sequences of tasks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;C1–C2–C1 and S1–C2–S1 block sequence (same task transition): the task on axis 1 (C1 or S1) repeated across blocks. As shown in the main text, monkeys tended to perform better during these task sequences, as if they were remembering the previous axis 1 task.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;span class="u-custom-list-number"&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;
                  
                    &lt;p&gt;S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–S1 block sequence (different task transition): the task on axis 1 changed across blocks. As shown in the main text (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4a&lt;/a&gt;), monkeys tended to perform worse on these task sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we were interested in understanding how changes in neural representations corresponded to the animals’ behavioural performance, we divided the ‘different task transition’ sequences into two further categories: in ‘Low Initial Performance’ blocks, the animal’s behavioural performance during the first 25 trials of the block was less than 50%, while on the ‘high initial performance’ blocks, the performance was greater than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owing to constrains on number of neurons, different but overlapping population of neurons were used to quantify neural representations in C1–C2–C1 and S1–C2–C1 tasks sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Task belief representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the animal’s internal representation of the task (that is, their ‘belief’ about the task, as represented by the neural population), we trained a task classifier to decode whether the current task was C1 or S1. The classifier was trained on neural data from the last 75 trials of each task block, when the animal’s performance was high (reflecting the fact that the animals were accurately estimating the task at the end of the block). The number of congruent and incongruent trials were balanced in the training dataset (32 trials: 4 trials for each of the four stimulus types, in each task). We included all C1 blocks regardless of their task sequence in training set. Only correct trials were used to train and test the classifier. To minimize the effect of neural response to visual stimulus, the classifier was trained on neural activity from the fixation period (that is, before stimulus onset). As we were interested in measuring differences between tasks, we did not subtract the mean firing rate before training the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task classifier was tested on trials from the beginning of blocks of the C1 task. Test trials were drawn from windows of 40 trials, slid every 5 trials, during learning (starting from trial 1–40 to trial 71–110). Overlapping test and train trials from the same task were removed. In contrast to training set, testing was done separately for S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 task sequences (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4d&lt;/a&gt;). As we were interested in focusing on the learning of the C1 task, we only used S1–C2–C1 task sequences with low initial performance (see above). Classifiers were tested on pseudopopulations built from trials within each trial window, with a minimum of four test trials (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types from task C1). Neurons that did not include the required number of test trials for all trial windows were dropped. Note that, as we were using a small moving window of trials during task discovery, we had to trade-off the number of included neurons and the number of train/test trials for this analysis. Moreover, although the number of correct trials increased as the animal discovered the task in effect, we kept a constant number of train and test trials in each of the sliding trial windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the animal’s belief above the current task, we measured the distance to the hyperplane of the C1/S1 task classifier (task belief encoding). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4d&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in pre-stimulus processing window (−400ms to 0 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Correlation between task belief encoding and behavioural performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the correlation between the animal’s task belief during task discovery and their behavioural performance (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;), we used Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; statistic with a permutation test to correct for autocorrelation in the signal (detailed below). This measurement was performed using data from each window of trials and the belief encoding, as estimated from the task classifier, on that same window of trials. As we are working with pseudopopulations of neurons, we estimated the behavioural performance for each window of trials during learning as the average of behavioural performance across all the trials in the window. The behavioural performance for each trial was taken as the average of the animal’s behavioural performance during the previous 10 trials. This yielded one average performance for each of the 16 trial windows. The task belief was measured for the same trials, using the average distance to the task classifier hyperplane, averaged over the time period from 400 ms to 0 ms before the onset of the stimulus (note that, as described above, all of these trials are withheld from the training data). Task belief was then taken as the average distance across all trials in a window of trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Evolution of colour category representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were interested in quantifying how the shared colour representation was engaged as the animal discovered the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4f,g&lt;/a&gt;). To this end, we trained a classifier to categorize colour using the last 75 trials of the C2 task, when the animal’s behavioural performance was high, and then tested it during discovery of the C1 task. The classifier was trained on only correct trials and the training data were balanced for congruent and incongruent stimuli (16 trials: 4 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types). This ensured an equal number of correct trials for each congruency type across all trial windows, controlling for motor response activity during the task discovery period. As cross-axis response decoding between the C1 and C2 tasks was weak (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig10"&gt;5d&lt;/a&gt;), cross-task classifiers are capturing the representation of the colour category that is shared between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the task classifier described above, the shared colour classifier was tested using trials from the C1 task in a sliding window of 40 trials stepped 5 trials, in both the S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 sequences of tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4f&lt;/a&gt;; as above, only low initial performance blocks were used for the S1–C2–C1 task sequences). We used four trials to test the classifier (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types from task C1). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4g&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in stimulus processing window (100 ms to 300 ms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec35"&gt;Evolution of shape category representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were interested in measuring the change in the representation of the stimulus’ shape category as the animal learned the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;). Our approach followed that of the colour category representation described above, and so we only note differences here. We trained a classifier to categorize stimulus shape based on neural responses during the S1 task (limited to the last 75 trials of each block). To ensure the classifier was only responding to shape (and not motor response), we trained the classifier on a balanced set of correct (rewarded) and incorrect (unrewarded) trials (16 trials: 4 trials for each reward condition and for each shape category). The classifier was tested using trials from the C1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;). Note that we used the same C1 trials to quantify the representation of shared colour category, shape category and task belief for S1–C2–C1 task sequences. For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4j&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in the window of time when stimuli were processed (100 ms to 300 ms after stimulus onset). The total numbers of LPFC neurons included for S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 task sequences to quantify the representation of shared colour category, shape category and task belief were 136 and 154, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;Evolution of response direction representation during task discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the change in response direction representation as the monkey’s learned the C1 task, we trained a classifier to categorize the response direction based on the neural response during the S1 task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4k&lt;/a&gt;; last 75 trials of the block). As above, we used a balanced number of correct and incorrect trials to control for information about the stimulus (12 trials: 3 trials for each reward condition and each response location). The classifier was then tested on correct trials from the C1 task during task learning (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4k&lt;/a&gt;; as above: sliding windows of 40 trials, stepped 5 trials, in S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1; tested on 4 trials: 1 for each reward condition and each response location). For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4l&lt;/a&gt;, we averaged the performance of the classifier in the window of time when response location was processed (200 ms to 400 ms after stimulus onset). The total numbers of LPFC neurons included for S1–C2–C1 and C1–C2–C1 task sequences to quantify the representation of shared response direction were 120 and 155, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec37"&gt;Classifier statistical test to detect trends during task discovery period&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the statistical significance of trends in representations during task discovery (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we used trend-free prewhitening (TFPW)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Yue, S., Pilon, P., Phinney, B. &amp;amp; Cavadias, G.

This method helps to reduce serial correlation in time-series data to obtain robust statistical inference in the presence of trends. TFPW first detrends the time series by removing Sen’s slope. It then prewhitens the time series by modelling autocorrelation with an autoregressive (AR) model (typically AR(1)) to produce residuals free of temporal dependencies. Finally, it adds back the original trend to generate processed time series. Both the Mann–Kendall statistics and Sen’s slope were used to estimate the significance of trends in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that our reported statistics are fully unbiased, we used the estimated Sen’s slope on prewhitened data using TFPW to estimate the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of the observed data. To do so, we used permutation tests to estimate the likelihood the observed trend slope occurred by chance. To create a null distribution of classifier performance, we randomly permuted the labels of test data 250 times across all trial windows (trials 1–110 for Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and 1–120 for Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). To stabilize the estimate of the classifier performance, we tested classifiers using the same set trained classifiers (for example, use same set of classifiers trained to decode colour category in C2 task to test colour category decoding in C1 task during task discovery). Furthermore, the performance of the classifier on the observed and each instance of the permuted data were averaged over 10-folds and 50 novel iterations of each classifier. The slope was calculated for each timepoint across all time trial windows to estimate the trend for observed and permuted classifier performances. The null distribution was the combination of the permuted and observed slope values (total &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 251). The likelihood of the observed slope was then estimated as its percentile within the null distribution. As described above, we used cluster correction to control for multiple comparisons across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure rank correlation between two random variables (for example, correlation between task belief and behavioural performance, Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;), we used Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;. As TFPW requires a monotonic time variable and cannot be applied here, we computed Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; for both observed and permuted datasets. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score values of observed data against permuted values were reported to account for autocorrelation inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Transfer of information between subspaces&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described in the main text, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that the representation of the stimulus colour in the shared colour subspace predicted the response in the shared response subspace on a trial-by-trial basis (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig3"&gt;3c–e&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig12"&gt;7a–c&lt;/a&gt;). To this end, we correlated trial-by-trial variability in the strength of encoding of colour and response along four different classifiers (using Pearson’s correlation as implemented in MATLAB’s corr.m function).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, as described above, a shared colour classifier was trained to decode colour category from the C2 task and tested on trials from the C1 task. Training data were balanced for correct and incorrect trials (rewarded and unrewarded trials, 16 trials: 4 trials for each reward condition and each colour category). Test trials were all correct trials (2 trials: 1 trial for each colour category). Both train and test trials were drawn from the last 50 trials from the block (to ensure the animals were performing the task well). The total number of LPFC neurons included for this classifier was 63 (only from monkey Si, owing to constraints on the number of trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a second shared response classifier was trained on trials from the S1 task and then tested on the same set of test trials as the shared colour classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third classifier was trained to decode the response direction on axis 2, using a balance of correct and incorrect trials from the C2 task. This classifier was tested on the same set of test trials as the shared colour classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a fourth classifier was trained to decode the shared colour representation but was now trained on correct trials from the C1 task (12 trials: 3 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types) and tested on correct trials from C2 task (2 trials: 1 trial for each colour category). The total number of LPFC neurons included for this classifier was 101 (only from animal Si, owing to constraints on the number of trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To account for the arbitrary nature of positive and negative labels, we calculated the magnitude of encoding by flipping the encoding for negative labels. All four classifiers were trained on 2,000 iterations of training set trials. Note, that the first three classifiers were tested on the same test trials, allowing for trial-by-trial correlations to be measured. Furthermore, all four classifiers were trained over time, enabling us to measure the cross-temporal correlation between any pairs of classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these four classifiers allowed us to test three hypothesized correlations that reflect the transfer of task-relevant stimulus information into representations of behavioural responses. First, one might expect that, on any given trial before the start of saccade, the strength and direction of the shared colour representation, as estimated by the distance to the hyperplane of the first classifier, should be correlated with the shared response, as estimated by the distance to the hyperplane of the second classifier. This correlation is seen in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig3"&gt;3c&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, during the performance of the C1 task, one would expect that before the start of saccade the shared colour representation should not be correlated with the response on the Axes 2 predicted by the C2 task. This is quantified by correlating the distance to the hyperplane of the first classifier and the distance to the hyperplane of the third classifier, as seen in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig3"&gt;3d&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one would expect these representations to be correlated when the animal is performing the C2 task. This is quantified by correlating the distance to the hyperplane of the fourth classifier and the distance to the hyperplane of the third classifier, as seen in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig12"&gt;7a&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Distance along colour and shape encoding axes during the discovery of the task&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how the geometry of the neural representation of the colour and shape of the stimulus evolved during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), we measured the distance in neural space between the two prototype colours (red and green) and the two prototype shapes (tee and bunny). Distance was measured along the encoding axis for each stimulus dimension (that is, the axis that is orthogonal to the colour and shape classifiers, described above). So, for each test trial, the distance along the colour encoding axis was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{colour}\,\mathrm{encoding}\,\mathrm{distance}\\ \,=\,\mathrm{Avg}\,\left(\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{abs}(\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{red}\,\mathrm{bunny})-\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{green}\,\mathrm{bunny})),\\ \mathrm{abs}(\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{red}\,\mathrm{tee})-\mathrm{encoding}(\mathrm{green}\,\mathrm{tee}))\end{array}\right)\,;\end{array}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach enabled us to calculate the distance along red/green colours while controlling for differences across shapes. The colour encoding distance was estimated for 250 iterations of the classifiers, enabling us to estimate the mean and standard error of the distance. A similar process was followed for estimating the shape encoding distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the colour and shape encoding distance during task discovery (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5a,b&lt;/a&gt;), we calculated the distance above in the sliding window of 45 trials, stepped 5 trials, after the switch into the C1 task during the S1–C2–C1 sequences of tasks with low initial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;CPI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPI was defined as the log of the ratio of average colour encoding distance and average shape encoding distance described above:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ7" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{CPI}=\log \,\left(\frac{\mathrm{avg}(\mathrm{Colour}\,\mathrm{encoding}\,\mathrm{distance})}{\mathrm{avg}(\mathrm{Shape}\,\mathrm{encoding}\,\mathrm{distance})}\right)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the CPI for each task (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5c&lt;/a&gt;), we computed the shape and colour encoding distance using all trials of a given task. To measure the shape distance for all three tasks, we trained a classifier to categorize stimulus shape based on neural responses during the S1 task (limited to the last 75 trials of each block). To ensure that the classifier was responding only to shape (and not motor response), we trained the classifier on a balanced set of correct (rewarded) and incorrect (unrewarded) trials (20 trials: 5 trials for each reward condition and for each shape category). Shape encoding for each task was calculated using four trials to test the classifier (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure colour distance in the S1–C2–C1 task, we trained colour category classifier on correct trials of the C1–C1–C2 task, balancing for congruent and incongruent stimuli (20 trials: 5 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types). Colour encoding for each task was calculated using four trials of that task to test the classifier (one trial for each of the four stimulus congruency types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track changes in the relative strength of colour and shape information during task discovery, we calculated CPI in a sliding window of 45 trials (slid every 5 trials starting from trial 1–45 to trial 76–120) after the monkey’s switched into the C1 task (during the S1–C2–C1 sequences of tasks, with low initial performance). Note, as we controlled for motor response when calculating shape and colour distance, the CPI is not affected by motor response information&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Flesch, T. et al.

CPI values in 100 ms–300 ms after stimulus onset and belief encoding values in 400 ms to 0 ms before stimulus onset were averaged for all trials in each trial window and the Mann–Kendall correlation between the resulting two vectors was calculated (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Quantifying suppression of axis representation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained a response axis classifier to decode whether the current task axis was axis 1 or axis 2. The classifier was trained on neural data from all trials of C1 and C2 tasks with an equal number of trials from each response direction on task specific axis (for example, equal trials for UL and LR response on axis 1 for C1 task, 36 trials: 9 trials for each response direction, in each task). All correct and incorrect trials were used to train and test the classifier. To capture the response period, the classifiers were trained on the number of spikes between 200 ms and 450 ms after stimulus onset. As we were interested in measuring the difference in neural activity between axis of responses, we did not subtract the mean FR before training the classifier.

Neurons with significantly negative &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights were categorized as selectively responding to axis 1. Neurons with significantly positive &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights were categorized as selectively responding to axis 2. Neurons without significant &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weights were categorized as non-selective (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10a&lt;/a&gt;). To determine the significance of a neuron’s classifier weight, we compared the observed &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; weight to a null distribution (two-tailed permutation test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the suppression of neural activity for each category of neurons, we averaged FRs of neurons in each category during trials of the C1 task when the animal responded on axis 1 or axis 2 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10e&lt;/a&gt; shows the same analysis for the S1 task). This meant including all trials when the animal responded on axis 1 (both correct and error) and all trials when the animal responded on axis 2 (all errors). As the monkeys rarely responded on incorrect axis (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig7"&gt;2g&lt;/a&gt;), the number of trials was limited and so neurons without any error trials on axis 2 were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that, although neurons were sorted by their activity during the animal’s response (200–450 ms after stimulus onset), we observed suppression across the entire trial (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig5"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, similar results were seen when a neuron’s axis selectivity was quantified on withheld trials (for example, in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig15"&gt;10d–i&lt;/a&gt;, axis selectivity was defined on S1 and C2 tasks and applied to C1 trials).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Decoding response axis during the discovery of the task&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained a response axis classifier to decode whether the current task axis was axis 1 or axis 2. The classifier was trained on neural data from the last 75 trials of the C1 and C2 tasks, when the monkey’s performance was high (reflecting the fact that the animals were accurately responding to the correct axis at the end of the block). The classifier was trained on an equal number of trials from each direction on the response axis (for example, equal trials for UL and LR response on axis 1 for C1 task; 36 trials: 9 trials for each response direction, in each task). Correct and incorrect trials were used to train and test the classifier. To remove the effect of stimulus processing, the classifier was trained on neural activity from the fixation period (that is, −400 to 0 ms before stimulus onset). As we were interested in measuring differences between axis of responses, we did not subtract the mean FR before training the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task classifier was tested on trials from the beginning of blocks of the C1 task. Test trials were drawn from windows of 10 trials, slid every 3 trials, during task discovery (starting from trial 1–10 to trial 66–75). Overlapping test and train trials from the same task were removed. Classifiers were tested on pseudopopulations built from trials within each trial window (two trials: one trial for each response direction on axis one from task C1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;Quantifying the angle between classifier hyperplanes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the similarity between the decision boundaries of classifiers trained on different tasks, we calculated the angle between the hyperplanes defined by their weight vectors. Each classifier produced a weight vector &lt;b&gt;w&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the hyperplane that separates the data points according to the respective task. We averaged the resulting hyperplane across resampling repetitions of trials (250 iterations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angle &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\theta \)&lt;/span&gt; between two average hyperplanes, defined by weight vectors &lt;b&gt;w&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;b&gt;w&lt;/b&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, was calculated using the cosine similarity, which is given by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ8" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\cos (\theta )=\frac{{{\bf{w}}}_{i}\cdot {{\bf{w}}}_{j}}{\Vert {{\bf{w}}}_{i}\Vert \Vert {{\bf{w}}}_{j}\Vert }$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angle &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; was then obtained by taking the inverse cosine of the cosine similarity. Angles close to 0° indicate that the classifiers’ hyperplanes are nearly parallel, implying similar decision boundaries across the tasks. Conversely, angles close to 90° suggest orthogonal hyperplanes, indicating distinct decision boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the angle within the C1 task, we calculated the angle between classifiers trained to classify colour category on the last 50 trials of C1 task in both the C1–C2–C1 task sequence and the S1–C2–C1 task sequence. This ensured that there were no overlapping trials between training samples. Only correct trials were used in this analysis and training and test trials were balanced for congruent and incongruent stimuli (20 trials: 5 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the angle between the colour category classifier in the C1 task and the C2 task, we trained the classifier on last 50 trials of task C1 and task C2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;TDR analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TDR analysis requires multiple steps&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 21" title="Mante, V., Sussillo, D., Shenoy, K.

Here, we describe each step in turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec47"&gt;Linear regression&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a GLM to relate the activity of each neuron (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;) to the task variables at each moment of time. The full model was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ9" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\begin{array}{l}y={\beta }_{0}+{\beta }_{1}\times \mathrm{stimulus}\,\mathrm{colour}\,\mathrm{morph}\,\mathrm{level}+{\beta }_{2}\\ \,\times \,\mathrm{stimulus}\,\mathrm{shape}\,\mathrm{morph}\,\mathrm{level}+{\beta }_{3}\times \mathrm{time}+{\beta }_{4}\times \mathrm{task}\,{\rm{S}}1+{\beta }_{5}\\ \,\times \,\mathrm{task}\,{\rm{C}}1+{\beta }_{6}\times \mathrm{task}\,{\rm{C}}2+{\beta }_{7}\\ \,\times \,\mathrm{motor}\,\mathrm{response}\,\mathrm{direction}\,\mathrm{on}\,\mathrm{axis}\,1+{\beta }_{7}\\ \,\times \,\mathrm{motor}\,\mathrm{response}\,\mathrm{direction}\,\mathrm{on}\,\mathrm{axis}\,2+{\beta }_{9}\times \mathrm{reward}\end{array}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; is the FR of each neuron, &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scored by subtracting the mean response from the FR at each timepoint and dividing it by the s.d. The mean and s.d. were computed across all trials and timepoints for each neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; are the regression coefficients corresponding to each predictor. Predictors were: stimulus colour morph level, coded as −1 for 0% morph level, −0.5 for 30% and 170% morph levels, +0.5 for 70% and 130% morph levels, and +1 for 100% morph level; stimulus shape morph level, coded as −1 for 0% morph level, −0.5 for 30% and 170% morph levels, +0.5 for 70% and 130% morph levels and +1 for 100% morph level; time, indicating the temporal progression within a recording session, normalized between 0 and 1 (continuous variable); task identity, indicating the identity of the task (categorical variable: S1, C1, C2); motor response direction on axis 1, indicating the direction of the motor response (categorical variable; −1 for UL, +1 for LR); motor response direction on axis 2, indicating the direction of the motor response (categorical variable; −1 for LL, +1 for UR); reward, indicating whether a reward was received following the response (binary variable; 1 for reward, 0 for no reward).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLM coefficients (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) were estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation as implemented by MATLAB’s lassoglm.m function. Independent models were fit for each timepoint. To address potential overfitting, we applied Lasso (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) regularization to the GLM weights with regularization coefficients (lambda) values of 0.0015. Correct and incorrect trials were used in fitting the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Population average responses&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated the average response of the neural population to each task variable. To calculate the average neural response to each colour and shape morph level, we separately averaged trials for within each morph level (0, 30, 70, 100, 130, 170) for each task. To calculate the average neural response for each response direction, we separately averaged trials for within each response direction (UL, UR, LL or LR) for each task. For all task variables, we smoothed the resulting response in time with a 150 ms Boxcar. Finally, we &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-scored the smoothed average for a given unit by subtracting the mean across times and conditions, and by dividing the result by the corresponding s.d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;PCA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used principal component analysis (PCA) (as implemented in MATLAB, pca.m function) to find the dimensions in the state space that captured most of the variance of the population average response and to mitigate the effect of noise. We concatenated the average response across conditions to build matrix &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; of size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;condition &lt;/sub&gt;× &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) × &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;unit&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;condition&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of conditions and &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; is the number of time samples. We used the first &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PCA&lt;/sub&gt; that captured 90% of the explained variance to define a de-noising matrix &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; of size &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;unit&lt;/sub&gt; × &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;unit&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Regression subspace&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the regression coefficients described above to identify dimensions in the state space containing task related variance. We used four task variables to define this space: colour morph level, shape morph level, response direction on axis 1 and response direction on axis 2. For each of these task variables, we built coefficient vectors &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{v,t}(i)\)&lt;/span&gt; corresponding to regression coefficient for task variable &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;, time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; and unit &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. We then denoised each variable vector by projecting it to the subspace spanned by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;PCA&lt;/sub&gt; principal components from the population average defined above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ10" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{v,t}^{{\rm{PCA}}}=D{\beta }_{v,t}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We computed &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{v}^{\max }\)&lt;/span&gt; for each task variable where norm of &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{v,t}^{\mathrm{PCA}}\)&lt;/span&gt; matrix had its maximum value. This defined the time-independent, denoised regression vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ11" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\beta }_{v}^{\max }={\beta }_{v,{t}_{v}^{\max }}^{\mathrm{PCA}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({t}_{v}^{\max }={\mathrm{argmax}}_{t}\parallel {\beta }_{v,t}^{\mathrm{PCA}}\parallel \)&lt;/span&gt;. To compute orthogonal axes of colour, shape and response direction on axis 1 and response direction on axis 2, we orthogonalized the regression vectors &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{v}^{\max }\)&lt;/span&gt; using &lt;i&gt;QR&lt;/i&gt; decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the first four columns of &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; are orthogonalized regression vectors &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{v}^{\perp }\)&lt;/span&gt; of four task variables that comprise the regression subspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To then estimate the representation of task-related variables in the neural population, we projected the average population response (described above) for each colour morph level, shape morph level, and response direction onto these orthogonal axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ13" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${p}_{v,c}={{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{v}^{\perp }}^{T}{X}_{c}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the time series with length &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; for each morph level in a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that because TDR orthogonalizes task features, it can control for motor response when estimating the neural response to colour and shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;CPI using TDR&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the distance between the two prototype colours (red and green) and the two prototype shapes (tee and bunny).

For ‘from switch’ conditions, the first 50 trials after switch to each task were used and, for ‘to switch’ conditions, the last 50 trials in the blocks were used. Similar to TDR method described above, we used QR decomposition to find the orthogonal axes encoding each task variable, but now specific to each task (colour morph level, shape morph level, task identity, reward and task specific axis of response):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ20" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${B}^{\max ,{\rm{C}}1\mathrm{task}}={Q}_{{\rm{C}}1}{R}_{{\rm{C}}1},{B}^{\max ,{\rm{C}}2\mathrm{task}}={Q}_{{\rm{C}}2}{R}_{{\rm{C}}2},{B}^{\max ,{\rm{S}}1\mathrm{task}}={Q}_{{\rm{S}}1}{R}_{{\rm{S}}1}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each resampling, the angle between orthogonal axis of colour of pairs of tasks (C1–C2, C1–S1 and C2–S1) was measured as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ21" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\cos (\theta )=\frac{{{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,i}^{\perp }\cdot {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,j}^{\perp }}{\parallel {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,i}^{\perp }\parallel \parallel {{\boldsymbol{\beta }}}_{\mathrm{colour},\mathrm{task}\,j}^{\perp }\parallel }$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; are task identity of the tasks. Within-task angles (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig14"&gt;9c,d&lt;/a&gt;) were computed by randomly taking 200 pairs of resampling regression coefficient repetitions, and finding the orthogonal axes explained above. All angles were wrapped to 90 deg. This was because the process of orthogonalization with QR decomposition might result in vectors that are mathematically equivalent but with a flipped sign compared to the input vectors owing to numerical choices or conventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a permutation test to assess whether the angle between pairs of tasks was significantly larger than expected by chance. The observed angle was estimated by fitting the regression model explained above to all trials. To compute a null distribution for angles, we generated 1,000 permuted datasets by randomly permuting the predictor values relative to the neural activity and refitting the model. For each permuted dataset, we computed the angle between task pairs as described above. The likelihood of the observed angle was then estimated by computing the proportion of permuted datasets that yielded an angle smaller than or equal to that of the observed angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec53"&gt;Quantifying whether task representations transfer across blocks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether the task representation was maintained across blocks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt;), we trained a classifier to discriminate between C1 and S1 trials using the last 50 trials of the block. We then tested this classifier in three ways. First, to quantify the information about the identity of C1 versus S1 task, we tested this classifier on withheld trials from last 50 trials of C1 and S1 tasks (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#Fig4"&gt;4b&lt;/a&gt; (1)). Second, to quantify how much the representation of C1 and S1 tasks transferred to the C2 task, we tested whether the classifier could discriminate between C1 and S1 tasks during the first 50 trials of the C2 task (that is, comparing C1–C2 versus S1–C2). Third, to quantify how much the representation of C1 and S1 tasks was transferred to C1 or S1 in the next block, we tested the classifier on the first 50 trials after the switch in C1 and S1 tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all training and testing, the total number of spikes in the period −400 to 0 ms from stimulus onset for each trial were used to build a pseudopopulation. Only correct trials were included in this analysis, and the training and test trials were balanced for congruent and incongruent stimuli (36 trials: 9 trials for each of the four stimulus congruency types). To compute a null distribution, we generated 1,000 permuted datasets by randomly permuting all task identity values relative to the neural activity and refitting the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec54"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09805-2#MOESM1"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 16:14:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBmX3k1SlM0Tk56a1JoMGxxbGNkVE52S0U2WEtZXzZseFlIUXBSWW4yczZYTUtRRVdIRGM0OHFNRUZSWndzYjdvYXAzNFBYWTZzNXFDVzFyMjU5TnZ5eWEw</guid></item><item><title>柠檬水的7个好处，由专家解释- Vogue</title><link>https://www.vogue.com/article/lemon-water-daily-benefits</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking water with a slice of lemon first thing in the morning is one of the most vouched-for wellness tips—and not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; for its purifying properties. The benefits of lemon water go beyond just detoxing. “It amplifies the benefits of water, adding both mental and physical virtues,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2"}' href="https://www.sulinu.com/pages/our-story?srsltid=AfmBOoqeIDP26nu9VQtq3JJu-z2IvQ7y-yjClbxMUSmrSuaKi8c8Syf2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kylie Bensley&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sulinu.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sulinu.com/"}' href="https://www.sulinu.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sulinu&lt;/a&gt;. “While drinking water can help us hit our hydration goals, infusing water with lemon is a very simple, quick task that boosts the function of water itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits of lemon water are many and worth diving into. Below, Bensley and nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/"}' href="https://slowlifehouse.com/sobre-nosotros/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Parada&lt;/a&gt;, director of &lt;a data-offer-url="https://slowlifehouse.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://slowlifehouse.com/"}' href="https://slowlifehouse.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Slow Life House&lt;/a&gt;, break down everything we need to know about lemon water and how to drink it the right way (because yes, there is a wrong way to do it). Read on to see what they had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water supports our overall health and helps keep us hydrated. Adding this citrus fruit to it is a nice bonus for even more health benefits. A glass of lemon water has six main ones, according to Bensley and Parada. These benefits include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Supports the Gut Microbiome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps kick-start the digestion process in the morning,” says Parada, adding that it also helps fight indigestion, heartburn, and bloating. Additionally, lemon is known to stimulate bile and gastric-juice production, which can help prevent gas formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Lemon water] improves gut transit and hydrates the colon,” says Parada, which is why it can help with constipation, especially on an empty stomach first thing in the morning. In addition, lemon, rich in fiber, supports &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/gut-digestive-health-best-expert-tips-nutritious-life-diet-sleep-stress-exercise-cleanse"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Strengthens the Immune System&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It strengthens the immune system,” says Parada, referring to the high vitamin C content of lemon juice. Additionally, it is also rich in vitamin B, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and enzymes. Studies show that lemon contains minerals that help &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003767/" target="_blank"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, supporting our overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Provides Antiaging Skin Benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is good for the skin because of its &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/anti-aging-antioxidant-skin-care-night-vitamin-c-resveratrol"&gt;high content of antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that “prevent damage from free radicals,” says Parada. Bensley agrees and says that lemon peels have been found to have antiaging benefits, reduce &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.606776/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;oxidative stress in skin cells&lt;/a&gt;, and boost collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Hydrates the Body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You always need to make sure you’re drinking enough water. Lemon water hydrates the body and, especially first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, is an effective way to stimulate the metabolism. Another benefit of upgrading a glass of water with lemon juice? It can help you reach your water-intake goals. “[It] can give it a pleasant taste that makes [drinking plenty of water] easier,” says Parada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Reduces Anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lemon’s scent is more than just pleasant. Bensley points to a study where orthopedic surgery patients who used lemons as a form of aromatherapy experienced &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10290404/"&gt;lowered pre-procedure anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Though more studies need to be done to definitively prove its effect on anxiety and stress, wanting to take a whiff of lemon water before you drink it isn’t harmful if this has piqued your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Possibly Helps Maintain (or Lose) Weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary research suggests that lemon water is associated with weight loss. Bensley points to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581754/"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that showed lemon polyphenols can suppress diet-induced obesity. “So while it may not help lose weight through its chemical properties, it can suppress the risk of obesity,” she says. But more studies are needed on the relationship between lemon water and weight loss. As with anything health related, experts always advise seeking medical advice from your doctor or health care provider to develop a safe plan to incorporate lemon water into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;May Help With Kidney-Stone Prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is true for certain types of kidney stones. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola"}' href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/heather-viola" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Viola&lt;/a&gt;, DO, assistant professor of general internal medicine at Mount Sinai, explains that lemon water is high in citrate, a compound that binds to calcium in the urine and helps reduce the formation of crystals that can turn into stones. So drinking lemon water increases your urine volume and dilutes stone-forming substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Downsides&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The side effects of lemon water are few, but there are certain things to keep in mind. Among all the benefits this offers, alkalizing is not one of them, says Parada. “It is often heard that lemon water could modify the pH of the blood with &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.in/content/acidity-diet-symptoms-foods-to-add-to-alkalise-body"&gt;an alkalizing effect&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “However, this is false since it’s the kidneys, liver, and lungs that are in charge of regulating blood acidity, keeping it in a range of 7.3 to 7.5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bensley advises against drinking water with lemon on an empty stomach, as it can be acidic and worsen already existing digestive problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux or frequent heartburn. She adds that the citric acid in lemons can worsen incontinence, as its acidity can irritate the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5rcE9TUmtzU1A4YzU1bHhqb01YdWV0TzRXa3FiN2dSYTNvR3cyeG9hUlotUC15UEdBQVI1aWpyOTNyTGc4dnRrWHd0UWowSzZfWWlYVENjSE9mR3M3ekk5ejFFSVVQZGc</guid></item><item><title>专家：使特立尼达和多巴哥更容易获得性传播感染药物-特立尼达和多巴哥新闻日</title><link>https://newsday.co.tt/2025/11/26/experts-make-sti-meds-more-readily-available-in-trinidad-and-tobago/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRINIDAD and Tobago must expand access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and doxycycline prophylaxis (doxy-prep) to combat HIV and rising sexually transmitted infections (STIs), health experts say, warning political, cultural, and religious barriers are slowing progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates speaking with Newsday on November 25 argue making these preventive tools widely available is not only a public health necessity but also a cost-effective strategy that empowers individuals to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianne Weekes, Coordinator of the National HIV Helpline, described PrEP and doxy-prep as “extremely important” in the fight against HIV and STIs but said previous government approaches failed to prioritise prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The previous administration’s position failed to consider the preventative and trauma-informed benefits,” she said. “The reality is, whether the medication is available or not, people will still make their own choices, whether to have multiple partners or engage in unprotected sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, former health minister Terrence Deyalsingh opposed public access to PrEP, citing concerns it would encourage promiscuity. A stance criticised by many as him imposing personal beliefs on public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekes expressed hope the current administration will pursue comprehensive policy updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a wide field that requires comprehensive reform,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her comments follow statements by Tobago House of Assembly Health Secretary Dr Faith Brebnor, who on November 20 urged for &lt;a href="https://newsday.co.tt/2025/11/21/brebnor-calls-for-hiv-prevention-medication-in-trinidad-and-tobago/"&gt;PrEP to be included&lt;/a&gt; in national HIV/AIDS prevention protocols. Brebnor made the remarks at a UNICEF event addressing rising syphilis cases among pregnant women and broader STI concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Pan American Health Organization event on November 18, Dr Adesh Sirjusingh, director of women’s health, reported nearly 200 cases of syphilis among pregnant women in 2025, far exceeding the typical 30–40 cases per year and surpassing the 100 cases reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trinidad and Tobago is one of the few countries in the Western Hemisphere where PrEP remains unavailable through public health programmes or on the open market,” Brebnor said. She noted the drug’s widespread use internationally as a preventive tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekes highlighted the global rise in syphilis and the impact of cuts to US funding for HIV/AIDS programmes, which previously accounted for 75 per cent of international financing. According to UNAIDS, an estimated 2.5 million people have lost access to HIV-prevention medicines, including PrEP, as clinics and community programmes close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if wider access to both drugs would strain the health system, Weekes said no. “In the long term, it actually reduces strain. It's about being proactive rather than reactive. Providing as many options as possible, ultimately saving resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAISO community case worker Rae Alibey echoed Weekes, stressing the importance of prevention tools for reducing stigma and empowering marginalised communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These tools empower people who are HIV-negative to have autonomy over their own sexual safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed prevention should not rely solely on people living with HIV, as the risk of transmission does not rest solely on their shoulders. Alibey noted accessibility remains a major issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The drugs exist but are not widely available to the public. It is not accessible over the counter, and obtaining it through a doctor can be difficult. Doxy-prep is sometimes given to medical professionals or sexual assault victims. Most people don’t know these options exist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called on Health Minister Dr Lackram Bodoe to foster open, intelligence-led discussions and comprehensive sex education in schools, saying it is the only step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If people learn how to navigate these issues early, they are less likely to face harm."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He urged conversations, led by the Ministry of Health, based on reality and evidence, not conservative rhetoric for political mileage. He said people must understand the risks, the options, and the resources available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibey said responsible conversations should include self-testing for HIV, understanding the correlation between syphilis and HIV, and awareness of additional layers of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Springer, an advocate for women and girls living with HIV in Trinidad and Tobago, highlighted how conservative societal attitudes hinder both access and national conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a very pretentious, conservative country. We don’t want to admit young people are having sex. We don’t want to acknowledge the LGBTQ community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springer pointed to gaps in sexual and reproductive health education, noting shortcomings in the Health and Family Life Education curriculum, which limits discussion on HIV and sexual health in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239666137-0"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springer discussed socio-economic vulnerabilities affecting women. She said, Globally, 53 per cent of new HIV infections occur in women and girls, and in Trinidad and Tobago, the situation is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Cepep programme employed many women. Some of them may now be in positions where they cannot afford basic necessities, pushing them into risky behaviours and financial dependence on partners. We cannot ignore this reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stressed the need for both preventive drugs and long-acting treatments that are available internationally. Springer said women’s health is more than gynaecological check-ups or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It includes sexual and reproductive health, HIV prevention, and overall well-being. Introducing effective drugs and preventive programmes will reduce the long-term cost of treatment and care by lowering new HIV infections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded that addressing HIV and STIs in the country requires more than a medical response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need integrated approaches to tackle it effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said expanding access to both drugs, updating sex education, and fostering evidence-based national conversations are critical steps in controlling transmission rates. Failure to act, she warns, could see preventable infections rise further, compounding social and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsday reached out to the health minister, who said he would provide a response at a later time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

It acts as the body’s natural detoxifier, filtering out toxins from the blood, breaking down harmful substances, and metabolizing drugs and alcohol. The liver also plays a crucial role in digestion by producing bile, which helps break down fats and absorb nutrients. But sadly, the erratic lifestyle habits have placed the liver health at risk. And it is necessary to find out as soon as possible if there is something wrong with the liver. According to Ayurveda, the liver is the seat of pitta dosha, states  Dr Hansa Yogendra, who runs the page called The Yoga Institute. In a recent video on YouTube, she explained that liver problems which show imbalance of pitta are skin inflammation, acne, cold sores and psoriasis. And excess toxin in the liver can lead to digestive issues. Along with digestive issues, other things like hormonal imbalance, itchy skin, dark urine and fatigue are also a result of unhealthy liver. Imbalances in the liver for longer duration may cause serious diseases such as hepatitis or jaundice, cirrhosis and even cancer. Therefore, you must naturally detox your liver regularly. And further in the video, she shared two recipes for liver detoxification that one can try at home.

&lt;p&gt;A newly shared &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRfrTjBkryk/?igsh=ZXBxbWJudjc3cWd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; video from the account @_gordonthegolden is melting hearts online. The footage shows &lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/strong&gt; puppy &lt;strong&gt;Gordon&lt;/strong&gt; adorably trying to “escape” a simple fence, making several confused attempts before finally finding his way out. Shared with the caption “It’s all new to Gordon!”, the short clip captures a cute and clumsy first encounter that instantly won viewers over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-puppy-makes-it-to-the-other-side-of-the-fence-in-cute-video"&gt;Golden Retriever puppy makes it to the other side of the fence in cute video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A video of a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/197247-golden-retriever-puppy-tv-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy named Gordon is sweeping Instagram after viewers fell in love with the pup’s charming struggle to understand how a fence works. In the video, Gordon is seen pacing behind a metal barrier, clearly determined to reach his owner but entirely unsure how to get around the obstacle. His attempts are as cute as they are funny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The subtitles added to the video mimic Gordon’s “thoughts,” making the moment even more endearing. According to the playful text, Gordon appears to be asking his owner for assistance, staring up with wide puppy eyes that perfectly capture his confusion. He pauses several times beside the fence, tilting his head and looking genuinely baffled, as though he believes the barrier has suddenly trapped him in place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/197457-golden-retriever-puppy-video-actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gordon&lt;/a&gt; seems to realize he needs a new plan and trots along the fence line with renewed enthusiasm, only to stall again when he fails to find a way out. It’s a moment dog owners know all too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, his owner gestures toward the open end of the fence. His tail then wags wildly as he crosses to the other side, rushing straight into his owner’s arms in an excited burst of joy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viewers adored the moment, with likes and comments praising the puppy’s efforts. One top comment called him “Smarty pants”. Others filled the post with heart emojis and likes, celebrating the wholesome scene and cheering Gordon on for finally figuring out the fence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video continues to grow in popularity, thanks to its perfect mix of innocence, puppy determination, and heart-melting charm, proving once again why Golden Retrievers remain one of the most beloved breeds on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="article-title"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Here’s how listening to music lowers your risk of dementia&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-meta"&gt; &lt;div class="article-meta-left"&gt;  &lt;p class="post-date"&gt; &lt;time datetime="2025-11-26T12:00:00+00:00"&gt;Wed 26 November 2025 12:00, UK&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of &lt;a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/tags/music-category" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; are indisputable, but new research has concluded that it can even keep dementia at bay among elderly folk, such that stories of older adults losing their memories but still being able to recall the lyrics to songs that moved them deeply in their youth are surprisingly common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us have witnessed a similar occurrence with ageing family members or loved ones, be it through music or other forms of art, where experiences that &lt;a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/uncovering-the-fascinating-science-of-music-and-memories" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;engage our senses&lt;/a&gt; on a profound level take root deep within our hearts, minds and souls, and these remain tucked away for years, only to re-emerge when we need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVVideo GRVPrimisVideo"&gt;&lt;p class="GRVVideo-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the mind active and regularly engaged with the memories accumulated over a lifetime is widely considered one of the most effective ways to help prevent cognitive decline, and there’s even scientific proof of this. A study by Monash University in Australia now suggests that music can lighten the burden of this process, as the innate joy and comfort from it can also help retain functionality, which is a major win for those accustomed to soundtracking their lives; turns out songs have the power to preserve life and, to some extent, the hope for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in October 2025, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by honours student Emma Jaffa and Professor Joanne Ryan, who monitored more than 10,800 adults over the age of 70, drawing a stark parallel between listening to music regularly and a 39% reduction in the risk of dementia. More specifically, those who formed the habit of getting through each day in conjunction with their favourite tunes also produced “better global cognition and memory scores”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found significant benefits attached to playing an instrument, and although supplementing a love for music with the practice of playing did illustrate a 35% lower risk of dementia, there was no substantial evidence that it positively impacts cognitive test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, those who combined listening to music and playing it demonstrated the most promising results, as doing both was linked to a 33% reduced risk of dementia and a 22% decline in cognitive impairment that isn’t related to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that those who were actively learning as part of the education system for 16 years or more benefited from the above habits more than people who weren’t in school and college for that many years, while additionally showing that these patterns seem to have no bearing on how the subjects perceive themselves or their overall cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these findings aren’t definitive since they are essentially conclusions drawn from positioning a specific set of practices alongside a timeline of mental well-being; however, simultaneously, music does generate positive results regardless of its potential influence on dementia, so there’s a strong case to be made in favour of encouraging elderly people to listen to their favourite songs as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/soundtrack-superiority-should-we-be-doing-more-to-engage-with-the-music-we-listen-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;Music makes life worth living&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s no surprise that it might even help extend our time on this planet. We often tether our memories to the songs we love, and there’s something quite beautiful and poetic about the way the moments we cherish most can live on within the art we value deeply, and these moments keep the art alive even in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe title="Elliott Smith – Memory Lane (from From A Basement On The Hill)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-uDPv7iQEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="tags-title hf"&gt;Related Topics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/article&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Far Out Magazine</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSDYxWkhYTlg3T0pmLV9XTXA5Ujh3U3dRTHZGZnZqUm9vTFFDZjRzWG5rTjhCMHFpclR4ZThwQS1oMXYyWW8tYkxPcnZWWXA4V1lOLVAxNkN3TVJYZUV2MWZoQzdqSmZ0MHlCeGUycHQ4VllwRURTNUtaaER6akVYalRRYw</guid></item><item><title>5种不同寻常的健康习惯专家宣誓效忠，包括嗡嗡声-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/unusual-wellness-habits-from-experts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this age of booming social media, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wellness trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; are everywhere.

Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system’s T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body’s own healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured’. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don’t have any symptoms anymore,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn’t observe before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;several types of cancer&lt;/a&gt; since it was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;first approved&lt;/a&gt; to treat blood cancers in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new frontier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Last year, Du was also involved in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;world-first study&lt;/a&gt; of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body’s tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Childhood – from birth to age nine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adolescence – from nine to 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adulthood – from 32 to 66&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early ageing – from 66 to 83&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late ageing – from 83 onwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-does-the-brain-shift-from-one-phase-to-the-next"&gt;When does the brain shift from one phase to the next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the brain adapts to new surroundings and situations between birth and old age, researchers found that four ages – nine, 32, 66 and 83 – were the most pivotal in the brain’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifts are characterised by developments such as puberty, personality stabilisation, “reorganisation” and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In detail, these are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-4132402" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/INTERACTIVE-BRAIN-PHASES-NOV26-2025-1764155777.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - BRAIN PHASES - NOV26, 2025-1764155777" data-interactive="true" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Childhood – birth to nine years old&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, the grey and white matter of the brain rapidly grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information from United States-based Johns Hopkins Medicine, while grey matter primarily processes and interprets information, white matter transmits that information to other parts of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the brain, grey matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath,” Johns Hopkins says. “In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: the white matter is on the outside, and the grey matter sits within.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the new study: “The first few years of life are marked by consolidation and competitive elimination of synapses [the junctions where neurons meet and communicate with each other] and rapid increases in grey and white matter volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This age also aligns with the onset of puberty, which begins between eight and 13 years old for females and nine and 14 years old for males, marking the initiation of significant alterations in hormone expression and robust neurological changes,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also found that the shift to adolescence introduced an “increased risk” of mental health, cognitive and behavioural disorders due to changes in hormones and a “neurobiological shift”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adolescence – 9 to 32&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, it was accepted that adolescence begins with puberty and ends before the age of 20. However, the study found that while adolescence certainly begins with puberty, its ending point is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The transition to adulthood is influenced by cultural, historical and social factors, making it context-dependent rather than a purely biological shift,” the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that in Western countries (ie, the United Kingdom and United States of America), adolescent topological development extends to around 32 years old, before brain networks begin a new trajectory of topological development,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that by age 32 in Western countries, the brain experiences the “most directional changes and a large shift in trajectory” compared with other turning points in life, as this is when white matter integrity and volume in the brain are increasing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors did not suggest a reason for this being the case in Western countries, and did not elaborate on how adolescence continues in people in other regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adulthood – 32 to 66&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that while brain development rapidly accelerates during the first two phases of life, in adulthood – the longest phase – there are no major turning points until the 60s, as the brain develops more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This period of network stability also corresponds with a plateau in intelligence and personality,” it found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early ageing – 66 to 83&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the brain does not show any abrupt signs of decline during this phase, shifts in the patterns of connection in the brain do occur due to a decrease in white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain now works more independently in separate regions, coordinating less as a single whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early 60s mark an important shift in health and cognition, with the onset of dementia and elevated blood pressure for many, both of which can accelerate brain ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Late ageing – 83 onwards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is less data on this era of the brain’s progression than the other phases due to a low sample size, the study’s findings correlated with a declining trend in brain connectivity, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, this could reflect a true weakening relationship between age and structural brain topology in late life,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-significant"&gt;Why is this significant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research into the period of adolescence is the most significant finding from the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, adolescence ranges from 10 to 19 years of age. In 2018, a report in The Lancet medical journal found that adolescence ended in the 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at Cambridge University in England and one of the authors of the study, told The Independent newspaper that the new report helps us better understand the brain’s vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases.

The doctors then revisited the patient's medical history, and he shared a crucial detail: starting about 30 years earlier, he had started receiving "unknown intramuscular injections (probably containing testosterone)" into his chest and upper-arm muscles to enlarge them, according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1357071345580968393&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12882-025-04397-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-mans-muscles-looked-strangely-deformed-doctors-found-they-were-leaking-calcium-into-his-blood" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12882-025-04397-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12882-025-04397-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-a-mans-muscles-looked-strangely-deformed-doctors-found-they-were-leaking-calcium-into-his-blood" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of his case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He stressed that the last dose of these injections was received 2 years ago," the report authors noted.

The team deduced that the man's past muscular injections probably contained &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-synthol-and-why-are-bodybuilders-injecting-it-into-their-muscles-237528" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-synthol-and-why-are-bodybuilders-injecting-it-into-their-muscles-237528" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;synthol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a substance made primarily of oil that visually "plumps" up muscles, essentially inflating them like water balloons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the synthol had triggered a persistent foreign-body reaction — the body essentially responding to material it could not break down. Over time, this reaction produced scarring and calcification, storing large amounts of calcium inside the muscle. And eventually, that calcium made its way into his bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;A couple &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2021/09000/synthol_systemic_complications__hypercalcemia_and.92.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2021/09000/synthol_systemic_complications__hypercalcemia_and.92.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of similar cases suggested that surgically removing the calcified muscle would be the only reliable long-term treatment for the man's persistently high calcium. In one previous patient, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl_3/iii434/3853797" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl_3/iii434/3853797" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;calcium levels returned to normal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three months after the tissue was removed. However, in the man's case, the authors did not state whether the patient ultimately underwent surgery, nor did they describe his long-term outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Synthol injections typically contain 85% medium-chain triglycerides, 7.5% of a local anesthetic like lidocaine, and 7.5% alcohol, purportedly for sterility. The oils act as the muscle-bulking agent, as the body does not easily process them, and the effects of these injections can linger for years. Even though it comes with serious risks, such as muscle deformity, chronic wounds and scarring, synthol is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/synthol-injections" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.healthline.com/health/synthol-injections" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;relatively easy to buy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b248fb1f-d151-44c0-98ca-382ecbb58551"&gt;Only two other cases of high blood calcium linked to synthol injections had been reported, the case report authors noted, and both were from Lebanon. The underlying mechanism driving the effect remains unclear. Synthol's better-known complications usually appear soon after an injection, but in this patient, the effects apparently emerged years later, which made the cause unusually difficult to identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this case adds further evidence that "synthol intramuscular injections are among the causes of elevated serum calcium levels," despite its rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more intriguing medical cases, check out our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/diagnostic-dilemma"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnostic Dilemma archives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="3a39cab6-ece3-4403-a54c-d26c5ffdab48"&gt;

Broad-spectrum inhibitory compounds include closantel (a livestock antiparasitic; 19 strains), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA; a brominated flame retardant; 19 strains), chlordecone (an insecticide; 17 strains), bisphenol AF (BPAF; used in plastics; 12 strains), fluazinam (a fungicide; nine strains) and emamectin benzoate (an insecticide; 13 strains).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 150 chemical–bacteria interactions featured &amp;gt;90% growth reduction, uncovering strong anti-gut-bacterial activity for 33 compounds (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;). To test whether the inhibitory activity was retained at lower concentrations, we tested 11 pesticides against eight bacteria across multiple concentrations (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig1"&gt;1f&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#MOESM3"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Independently purchased compounds were used to account for any errors associated with batch variations and large-scale library preparations. Most interactions from the main screen were also observed in this independent experiment (72%; 23 out of 32; Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig5"&gt;1c,d&lt;/a&gt;), which is the expected range considering the physiological idiosyncrasies of non-model bacteria&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="Müller, P. et al.

As in the case of therapeutic drugs, we observed a positive correlation between the number of compounds affecting a species and its relative abundance in human microbiomes (Spearman’s rank correlation (&lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;) = 0.57; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig2"&gt;2a&lt;/a&gt;), but none with prevalence (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, chemicals with broad- as well as narrow-spectrum activity are likely to influence microbiome composition due to their impact on abundant taxa.

Although a model trained and tested on the combined pesticide–drug dataset showed similar performance, cross-predictions from one dataset to another showed poorer performance (approximate balanced accuracy = 0.7; average precision = 0.2). This indicates that pesticides and drugs are overall different in both chemical and activity space (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig3"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;).

For example, strains with insertions in genes of the &lt;i&gt;fadL&lt;/i&gt; family of hydrophobic compound transporters (&lt;i&gt;NQ542_07320&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NQ542_08455&lt;/i&gt;) were prevalent negative fitness hits across seven xenobiotics, whereas insertion mutants of the RND multidrug efflux locus &lt;i&gt;NQ542_06240–50&lt;/i&gt; were a significant hit across five chemicals (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig8"&gt;4c&lt;/a&gt;). Other common negative fitness hits were Tn mutants of the genes encoding components of the F0F1 ATP synthase complex (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig4"&gt;4e&lt;/a&gt;), the loss of function of which has been associated with increased sensitivity to polymyxin antibiotics under anaerobic conditions&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 53" title="Vestergaard, M. et al.
