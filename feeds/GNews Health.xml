Scanning the laminated menu, I recognize there is almost nothing that I’d have been willing to eat a year ago. Phosphorescent eggs fried on the griddle with some neutral oil? No thanks. A bowl of yogurt? Maybe — until I remember the preservatives and the mystery stabilizers with names too difficult to pronounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first heard the term “seed oils” in the summer of 2021 on a popular contrarian podcast that gained traction during the pandemic for its anti-woke commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seed oils are vegetable oils derived from plants like soybean, canola, sunflower, corn and safflower. Often found in salad dressings, and processed and fried foods, they’re used more frequently in many restaurants than olive oil or butter because of their lower costs, higher smoking points and neutral taste profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their idiosyncratic vocal fry, the hosts discussed a book by a doctor who had helped to launch the seed oil-free movement in the early 2000s. The doctor claimed seed oils were among the worst things you could put in your body because they supposedly caused inflammation, interfered with cellular function and contributed to chronic illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think much more about the podcast until a week later when I was sitting with 10 of my best friends in a dimly-lit restaurant on Henry Street for my birthday. I had ordered pancakes for dinner, but Jane, my friend sitting to my right, opted for crudite. Steam curled from the stack of buttery, fluffy pancakes on my plate, while a neatly assembled assortment of carrots, celery and peppers surrounded a bowl of hummus on hers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew that Jane had joined the seed oil-free “movement” a few months earlier, and we had talked about the podcast I’d heard, but I had no idea she was taking it so seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re crazy, Jane,” I laughed, staring incredulously at her plate of raw vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m telling you — I’ve never felt better. I’ve completely stopped getting period cramps and headaches,” she replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, another friend whispered in my ear, “Jane is looking really thin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that birthday dinner, something in me began to shift. I still ate what I wanted, but not without a quiet calculation. Before each bite, a whisper crept in: &lt;em&gt;What’s in this? Should I be eating it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slowly started to listen to that voice. Soon, Jane and I began to speak a shared language with our choices — one that signaled discipline, awareness and a subtle sense of moral high ground. Within months, I was severely limiting what I’d put into my body, but I was telling myself it was to protect my health. However, beneath my reasoning was a creeping fear. The more I heard about seed oils, additives and processed foods, the smaller my world became. My quest to “eat clean” gradually slipped into something more obsessive — something that bordered on orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370446/#:~:text=Orthorexia%20nervosa%20is%20perhaps%20best,and%20poor%20quality%20of%20life." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Orthorexia nervosa" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370446/#:~:text=Orthorexia%20nervosa%20is%20perhaps%20best,and%20poor%20quality%20of%20life." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Orthorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;, a term introduced in the late 1990s, describes an extreme fixation on consuming only foods deemed pure, healthy or natural. While caring about nutrition isn’t necessarily harmful, orthorexia becomes dangerous when rigid food rules begin to dominate a person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not formally recognized in the DSM-5, orthorexia is receiving increased attention, especially as social media fuels disordered thinking and eating. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="meta-analysis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; shows symptoms of orthorexia are rising across genders. For men, restrictive eating is often linked to achieving ideal physical performance. For women, it’s more commonly tied to a desire for purity — eating in a way that feels clean and natural. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have played a major role in normalizing this anxiety by cloaking misinformation in the language of “wellness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Ilana Amselem"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Ilana Amselem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was disturbingly easy for me to fall into this world. It started with small, seemingly harmless choices. I bought a different brand of yogurt. I tried a new water filter. I skipped dining out. But over time, these tweaks accumulated into an identity. And the repetition, along with the sheer volume of content that continually reinforced the same messages, made it feel like the truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, a 2017 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that nearly half of Instagram users following health food accounts showed signs of orthorexia. TikTok and other short-form video platforms have only amplified the reach of obsessive food messaging, turning personal anxiety into a cultural script.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint exactly what changed in the years that followed. After an intense breakup left me feeling unmoored, I turned to food as a way to reclaim control. Health, however I defined it, suddenly took center stage. With so much in my life up in the air, leaving my health to chance didn’t feel like a real option. I had no clue where I was headed or who I was becoming, so I clung to something I could manage: my meals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I mostly stopped eating in restaurants. My sisters thought that my stringent diet was bogus. I couldn’t disagree with them, because I literally did not know the facts. They would roll their eyes every time I exclaimed that a snack product was seed oil-free. I fell down a rabbit hole. I stopped touching receipts (due to forever chemicals). I bought a special water filter (to eliminate fluoride from my drinking water). I stopped drinking out of plastic bottles (to reduce my exposure to microplastics). I threw away my AirPods (bluetooth brain damage).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I worked out constantly on little food, running my body ragged trying to be the “healthiest version of myself.” I pushed my body to its limits chasing an illusion of wellness shaped by influencers who profited off my health anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My Instagram feed became a relentless procession of wellness evangelists, each pushing their own supplement and preaching that everything else was toxic. If I wanted to be truly healthy, I needed to buy in. Americans now spend an estimated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/tiktok-shopping-statistics/#:~:text=79.3%25%20of%20TikTok%20Shop%20sales,site%20for%20shopping%20in%202023." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="$32 million" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6900d013e4b0973a4c058752" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/tiktok-shopping-statistics/#:~:text=79.3%25%20of%20TikTok%20Shop%20sales,site%20for%20shopping%20in%202023." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;$32 million&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; per day shopping on TikTok, with more than &lt;/span&gt;7&lt;span&gt;9% of purchases falling under health and beauty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This booming industry includes everything from vitamins and herbal tinctures to protein powders, drink mixes and adaptogenic gummies.

I lost nearly 30 pounds. And the truth is I thought I looked better. That’s the part I still struggle with. It’s hard to untangle the health anxiety from the thrill of being thin. I had never really cared before, but now that I was smaller, I liked it. My quest for purity and optimization quietly morphed into something more familiar and more insidious: a desire to keep looking the way I did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By September of 2024, my hair was falling out. I asked my friend, a dermatologist, what could be going on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s probably just stress,” I reasoned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You have lost a lot of weight, Ilana,” she responded. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At a party the following month, three friends, independently, mentioned my weight loss. It was obvious they’d talked about it behind my back, and the realization stung. What were they seeing that I couldn’t? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, their comments felt offhanded — there were no serious confrontations and nothing that felt like true concern. Though they noticed my weight loss, my eating habits had changed so gradually that even those closest to me barely registered how intense my restrictions had become.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, I started grad school, and I suddenly had to explain my eating habits to strangers at lunch. It was embarrassing. Unlike my friends, these new people hadn’t been slowly desensitized to what I was doing — or not doing. I started to examine the content on my feed with a new lens, and I began to scrutinize the videos in a way I hadn’t before. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more I saw, the more uneasy I became. I wanted to escape the algorithm, so I began reading, at first out of defensiveness — desperate to validate what I already believed. I was hoping to find studies that confirmed everything I’d absorbed from social media: that seed oils were toxic, that fluoride was dangerous, that microplastics were slowly poisoning me. But the deeper I went, the harder it became to ignore the cracks in what I’d been told.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I combed through nutrition studies, public health reports, interviews with registered dietitians, and medical reviews. I tried to trace the origins of some of the most viral claims. Who first said seed oils were inflammatory? Why were certain additives labeled as carcinogens by influencers but deemed safe by every major health organization? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I started to realize that much of what I’d internalized had no grounding in science. The sources cited in wellness content were rarely peer-reviewed studies, and when legitimate research was referenced, it was often inconclusive, outdated, or so narrowly focused that drawing such sweeping conclusions felt irresponsible. When studies were cited, they were almost always stripped of context. The most alarming or sensational detail was pulled out, inflated, and repeated for maximum engagement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What stunned me, more than anything, was how thin the foundation was — how much of my belief system had been built on fragments, not facts. But when you’re inundated with content that insists you’re being poisoned by your food, your water, your environment — and that you’re being lied to by the organizations who are supposed to protect you — it starts to feel irresponsible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to listen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Slowly, I started to let go. I saw a therapist and opened up about my eating habits. She helped me see that demonizing entire food groups was rarely productive and pushed me to eat foods I had previously deemed “unhealthy.” I ate out more. I let myself have a French fry now and then. However, it took time and significant energy to loosen the grip, and I’m still not entirely free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can count on one hand the number of receipts I’ve touched in the past several years. I still hesitate before eating something greasy, wondering what long-term damage it might do. But I take a breath, acknowledge the thought, and try not to let it lead or linger. I’ve blocked the influencers I used to idolize and stopped scanning every ingredient list I encounter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not easy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even now I still worry about what I’m putting in or near my body. But I’m trying to base my actions on science, not social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I sit here in this diner, my legs sticking to the vinyl seat, the waitress drops off our food. I stare at the overcooked scrambled eggs, topped with square slices of glossy, plastic-looking &lt;/span&gt;American cheese&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cannot be healthy,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; I think while taking a bite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some names and identifying details have been changed to protect the identity of individuals mentioned in this essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ilana Amselem is a graduate student and journalist who often writes about art, architecture and pop culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

The advisory panel, hand-picked by Donald Trump’s controversial health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, includes longtime anti-vaccine advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, himself a prominent anti-vaccine activist, has long pushed for delaying the shot. Experts say any change to the current hepatitis B vaccination recommended schedule could have significant and far-reaching consequences for childhood health in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In one pointed exchange on Thursday, Joseph Hibbeln, an ACIP member and psychiatrist and neuroscientist, asked: “Is there any specific evidence of harm of giving this vaccination before 30 days? Or is this speculation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is limited evidence about the long-term risk,” said Mark Blaxill, an author who has argued that vaccines cause autism and other conditions, and who was recently named senior adviser at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So this was speculation and limited evidence,” Hibbeln replied. “OK, got it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The advisory panel can only make recommendations to the head of the CDC, acting director Jim O’Neill. The previous director, Susan Monarez, was ousted by the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; in August after the White House claimed she was “not aligned” with the president’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this year, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dismissed all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the advisory committee. He has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;replaced them&lt;/a&gt; with his own appointees, including several vaccine skeptics who align with Kennedy’s desire to overhaul – and possibly, in some cases, scrap – longstanding vaccination recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The panel’s membership changed again this week, when the health department announced that the committee’s most recent chair, Dr Martin Kulldorff, would depart for an official role within the agency. He was replaced by Dr Kirk Milhoan, a cardiologist who has been critical of the Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melody Schreiber contributed reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQdzQwcU9WTUV3QXl5MGlXTkJ4RWUyYVNieUpORi1DQ1RhdzMwSlZuRkYyc1Jua0ktOGhKVWlvRWdrRmJ6M2Z3UmJ1cllFa0pUQVJUaFExeFgwX1VseGlmQ2k3bklyQjlDSXZqTDNuSXllcDRSbkxOSmlhYnZBVnRoNW83LTZlOVQ1cXlF</guid></item><item><title>您真正应该知道的6种痴呆症身体症状- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/physical-symptoms-of-dementia_l_692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting older comes with many changes, not the least of which are occasional memory lapses, which tend to worry many people in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cognitive changes can be totally normal, so there is no need to panic if you occasionally forget your sunglasses or the name of your son’s former teacher. But there is a clear difference between age-related cognitive changes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 7 million people in America have dementia, and it’s expected that &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="number will double" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nyulangone.org/news/united-states-dementia-cases-estimated-double-2060" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;number will double&lt;/a&gt; by 2060. Experts say cognitive impairment becomes something more severe at a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The magic line that transitions someone from mild cognitive impairment to dementia is when one of their cognitive impairments is impairing function. For me, that’s one of the key parts of defining when someone has transitioned to dementia,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stephanie Nothelle" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stephanie-nothelle/2705234" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Dr. Stephanie Nothelle&lt;/a&gt;, a geriatrician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean no longer being able to use a car, getting lost while driving a familiar route or not being able to do one’s taxes after decades of doing them, she said. If cognitive changes make it tough to get through a normal day, that’s a red flag, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; is an umbrella term that describes multiple forms of cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia), vascular dementia and Parkinson’s, according to Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact manifestations of the disease depend on the actual diagnosis. And while cognitive impairment is a common thread, there are also some physical symptoms that tend to be associated with dementia. Here’s what they are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Trouble Walking And Balancing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find that a lot of the more physical manifestations happen later in the course of dementia,” Nothelle said. But there is a physical issue that occurs earlier on and gets worse throughout the course of the disease, she said, and that’s “someone’s ability to walk and maintain balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to maintain your balance and walk smoothly, actually, it requires a lot of brain power because you have to process a lot of different inputs,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to process sensations from your feet, you have to process what your eye is seeing in the environment around you and more. “You have to quickly react to these things, and so it’s a very cognitive task to be able to walk,” Nothelle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of all of this, trouble walking, &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/importance-of-balance-health-falls_l_69149febe4b0c2898bed35f8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="trouble balancing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="69149febe4b0c2898bed35f8" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;trouble balancing&lt;/a&gt; and falling frequently is a sign of dementia. (But note that these issues aren’t only a sign of the disease; they can be due to arthritis or even clumsiness.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Posture Changes And Feet Shuffling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-most-common form of dementia is Lewy body dementia, said &lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jori Fleisher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f4f9ce4b017c8f3fac047" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/jori-fleisher-md-msce-faan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Jori Fleisher&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago. This describes a few types of dementia, including Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this manifestation, you may notice posture changes, feet shuffling or that someone is walking slower than they used to, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s easy to chalk these issues up to getting older, not paying attention or arthritis, “if we’re seeing a pattern of that, we want to pay attention to it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Changes In Your Sense Of Taste And Smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change in your sense of taste or smell can be attributed to many issues, such as a COVID-19 infection or a history of sinus problems, but outside of known factors, unexplained changes in these senses can also be related to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes the person doesn’t notice it themselves, but their loved one is going, ‘Hey, something on the stove and was burning and you didn’t smell that,’” Fleisher explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a symptom that should push someone to see a doctor. While it may not be a sign of all forms of dementia, it is associated with Lewy body dementia, according to Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Problems Swallowing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with dementia may also experience trouble swallowing food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People will be eating or drinking, and things will have a tendency to accidentally ‘go down the wrong pipe,’ so to say,” said Nothelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the food actually does go down the wrong pipe, she said. “If you have food or fluid that goes down your windpipe into your lungs, that’s not supposed to be there,” Nothelle noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saliva helps us swallow food and drinks, and “our mouths are full of bacteria,” she said. While some of the bacteria is good, some of it is not-so-good (hence cavities and gum disease) and if that bad bacteria ends up in your lungs with your food, it can set you up for infection, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We call that aspiration pneumonia, and that’s why pneumonia is relatively common in the later part of dementia,” Nothelle explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Things such as swallowing trouble, balance problems and more can all be ways that dementia shows up physically.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Bladder Control Issues &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incontinence, unfortunately, can be a symptom of dementia,” said Nothelle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of nerves are required for bladder control, “and those nerves degenerate as dementia progresses,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, folks may experience new constipation later in life, according to Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That can also be a sign of Parkinson’s and related conditions, and often precedes the other symptoms by years,” Fleisher noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Sleep Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Fleisher, sleep changes are also important to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person experiencing sleep changes may not notice, but if you live with someone and find they’re moving around a lot at night, punching, shouting or talking in their sleep, it’s important to let their health care team know, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That may be something called REM behavior disorder, which often can come years before a person has Parkinson’s or Lewy body dementia,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An early diagnosis can be a powerful way to prepare for the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can certainly be hard to admit to any health problems or changes, especially when it comes to cognition — but it’s important to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living in a time of innovation when it comes to dementia treatments, said Fleisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s lots of different research going on right now to try to find treatments and pharmaceutical options for people,” Nothelle added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can check biomarkers in blood or spinal fluid to determine what kind of dementia someone has and make treatment decisions based on that, Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, it’s best to start treatments or interventions early on in the course of the disease, both Nothelle and Fleisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatments aren’t a cure, but can help with disease management. More, an early diagnosis can also help families (and individuals) best prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finding out early on can be really helpful for a lot of different reasons, including planning and just having a say in your future,” said Nothelle.

But perhaps that assumption isn't always true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2174/011570159X327712241023084944"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; has found that changes to the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A &lt;/em&gt;gene are associated with early-onset &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-seeds-of-schizophrenia-may-be-planted-in-the-earliest-moments-of-life"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; in childhood or early adolescence, sooner than the disorder typically presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a registry of the world's largest cohort of &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; patients, the researchers led an international investigation into the effects of mutations in &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 121 individuals with likely disease-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene, the team found that 25 had a diagnosed mental disorder, including mood, anxiety, psychotic, personality, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-long-term-impacts-of-eating-disorders-are-far-more-serious-than-you-might-realize"&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but two of these individuals carried the "null" variant of &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt;, suggesting it was non-functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184399" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184399" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-642x361.jpg" alt="DNA Sanger Sequencing and a Magnifying Glass Showing the DNA Helix" class="size-medium wp-image-184399" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DNA-under-magnifying-glass-colorful.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184399" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Among 121 individuals with likely disease-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene, 25 had a diagnosed mental disorder.

Dysfunction of these receptors is closely associated with epilepsy and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four individuals in the current study had been treated in the past with L-serine, an amino acid that activates these glutamate receptors to help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13311-021-01173-9"&gt;reduce seizures&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, all four participants experienced positive improvements to their mental health disorder after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One individual stopped experiencing hallucinations. Another showed improvements in their behavioral disorder. The remaining two showed remission from paranoid symptoms and a reduction in seizure frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small sample size limits the study, but it suggests that not all &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/couples-are-more-likely-to-share-psychiatric-disorders-but-why"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; arise from numerous interacting genetic variants. Instead, some conditions could be precisely treated based on their genetic differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How exactly the &lt;em&gt;GRIN2A&lt;/em&gt; gene may drive these disorders is another matter that needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03279-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s even though there remains no federal pushback to the flu shot, unlike annual Covid boosters, said Dr. Kathryn Anderson, the county health commissioner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XKYHCN7HVRH6DODGSKJLKICFKA"&gt;More than half of Americans typically get the seasonal flu vaccine, according to federal data. But that rate has been creeping down since the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="56Z6XZZNKZDBVMKCUGN4CMGZZE"&gt;This year, only 27% of Onondaga County residents have gotten the flu vaccine so far, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data"&gt;according to state data&lt;/a&gt;. In previous years, more than 40% had gotten their shot by this point, indicating a decline of 60,000 people. (The remaining 10% or so typically get the shot between December and May, according to federal data.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HNW7E76WCNB2NL2B26P746IBHY"&gt;Statewide, 21% have gotten the vaccine so far, or nearly 4 million fewer than at this point in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MB3JDAJP2ZE3FNGAAMGBAN4Z5A"&gt;Faced with such a dropoff, Anderson is urging people to get a flu shot now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ATK3C6CIPZA5VPWWRSEFTVRXNQ"&gt;The number of flu cases has spiked in recent weeks, with the state making its &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-02_flu_prevalent.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-12-02_flu_prevalent.htm"&gt;annual declaration of flu season&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UA7COUDOSJGTZIDXI2NOA4BURM"&gt;In the past three weeks, Upstate University Hospital’s ER has treated nearly 1,800 people for flu-like symptoms, according to hospital data. Statewide, more than 17,500 flu cases had been reported in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZN7KLI75EFGGZFWJUEKPPCJY4E"&gt;Flu vaccination rates increased with public health campaigns in recent decades. Vaccinations reached a high mark of 52% of Americans in 2020-21 before going down in each of the past three seasons. A survey of American attitudes toward flu vaccines found that 40% were worried about side effects, getting sick from the vaccine or questioned its effectiveness, &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/2025-national-survey-on-respiratory-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nfid.org/resource/2025-national-survey-on-respiratory-diseases/"&gt;according to the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W55CSNANGVC5PEQ2EXMGYGW3H4"&gt;Anderson said she can’t say for sure why vaccination rates are down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CRLQGZUDX5GLZDDUHZEAVYOGWA"&gt;But vaccine skepticism has become more pronounced in recent years, with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., questioning many vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UWAGI2VNW5C27LE4ANVLYOCPEE"&gt;Still, the flu vaccine remains uncontroversial, Anderson said. Federal officials have not changed their stance: They still recommend the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WKAMJN3WMZAVFCY3MJTKNWM6TI"&gt;“Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged (over) 6 months without a contraindication to vaccination to protect against influenza and its complications,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7432a2.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7432a2_w" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7432a2.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7432a2_w"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RYUQXYHQZRG3LPVRZE3KURQ4AQ"&gt;Complications from the flu, especially pneumonia, kill tens of thousands of mostly elderly Americans each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RMOIJGSOWNASTFBHQHTKLNQVRI"&gt;Vaccination rates among the elderly are much higher, reaching 70% in a typical year.

That’s the case this year, too. There’s one strain in particular that seems to have mutated enough to break through the vaccine, Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NWNQDGEZBVGWZKYGQ5KA74VJGU"&gt;Even so, the vaccine provides partial protection for all flu types, which could be the difference between a few days sick at home vs. a trip to the emergency room or a hospital stay, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JDFYOSRWTBEMRCW6BOHHBPNOWU"&gt;Anderson, a trained infectious disease doctor, said confusion over vaccines abounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZLNIHAUD6VHOBAGPTK57ZUD2TE"&gt;She pointed to a question earlier this year about whether able-bodied adults were eligible for the Covid vaccine. Only 10% of Onondaga County residents have received this year’s booster so far, according to state data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XA7KGFG2HBGNLB3LI2I3BJPVDE"&gt;And this week, a federal panel met to discuss whether to delay a hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. There’s also fresh skepticism toward the measles vaccine, with the highly infectious and potentially deadly disease reaching its highest levels in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2CQDVI5KIVB4NJYMVYGKS5HV5M"&gt;Anderson said none of the recent vaccine skepticism is based on new science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H7RDTWEQPNHFZF7VGPP4QDMWZU"&gt;“The main point lost in all this, there’s not new information going on here,” she said. “There’s understandable tension between individual choice and the public good ...

According &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-06-2024-nearly-1.8-billion-adults-at-risk-of-disease-from-not-doing-enough-physical-activity" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;to the World Health Organization (WHO&lt;/a&gt;), this reflects a worrying global trend where nearly 1.8 billion adults are at risk of disease because they don't do enough physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We all know that physical activity is good for our health but many of us are not active enough," says Amanda Daley, professor of behavioural medicine at Loughborough University in the UK. "There are lots of reasons, with the most common one being not having enough time. The micro exercise [or VILPA] approach to physical activity only requires a few minutes of people's time, a few times a day over a week, making it very easy, accessible and inexpensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What VILPA shows is that simply tweaking your day so that you run for the bus, power walk around the house when doing errands, or carry out the housework or gardening with a bit more energy can make a significant difference when it comes to improving your health. These are all everyday examples of VILPA, as is playing high-energy games with your children and pets. "We have different opportunities to engage in moderate to vigorous activity and it doesn't necessarily have to be through [formal] exercise or specialised gym equipment," says Ahmadi. "If you're going for a walk, mixing in brief bursts of fast-paced walking can be an easy way to accrue VILPA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-bc40c3a0-0 kXcvpr"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 jJmNMc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mll5zb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty images Everyday activities such as playing with your children or pets can boost fitness (Credit: Getty images)" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Everyday activities such as playing with your children or pets can boost fitness (Credit: Getty images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13050-x" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Surveys show&lt;/a&gt; that people respond positively to the idea, as it highlights the benefits of activities which they may not previously have considered to be health-boosting.

Chan School of Public Health were once full of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and interns. Young scientists here worked on some of the most cutting-edge computational biology research in the world, driving new discoveries and the creation of widely used big data tools, including one the National Cancer Institute named among the most important advances of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, the offices are rows of empty computer pods. Monitor brackets at each station hang in the air as bare as bleached corals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disaster that struck Quackenbush and his lab began earlier this year, when the Trump administration began rapidly slashing funds that fueled research programs all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;His is one of hundreds of labs that have been struggling to stay afloat since. Universities, facing the threat of even more deep cuts to National Institutes of Health funding in the near future, laid off support staff, reduced hiring, and recruited fewer graduate students and fellows. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, Quackenbush’s lab has been at the forefront of human genetics research and bioinformatics. The computational tools developed by the lab help scientists understand how genes are controlled and how things go awry in diseases from cancer to autism, and make it possible for scientists to model cell biology and genetics at a deeper, more complex level. That’s why many of the “most influential labs in the world” tend to collaborate with Quackenbush, said Kenneth Ramos, a cancer researcher at Texas A&amp;amp;M Health. As of this year, Quackenbush’s work has a staggering 100,000 citations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“John has been one of the most impactful bioinformaticians working in the genomic space in the last 25 years,” Ramos said. “He made a lot of resources he developed publicly available. He is bright, curious, and digs deep into scientific questions. And he is kind, the most collegial person you can imagine.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush anticipated trouble, to an extent. When Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2024, Quackenbush decided to stop hiring new trainees. “I read the Project 2025 stuff. I knew biomedical research was in the crosshairs,” he said in an interview with STAT. If something happened to scientific funding, he wanted to make sure he could stretch whatever dollars he had for as long as possible. “I held back, trying to be cautious, not knowing what would happen,” he said. “And the money is now basically gone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major loss came in April, when Quackenbush, like many other scientists over the past year, learned that a research program he depended on was gone. He had submitted a renewal application for a grant to study sex and gender differences in medicine, but communication freezes and other disruptions delayed the review date. Then, on April 4, the review date for the grant vanished, and a program officer told Quackenbush that the program had been terminated because it “no longer aligned with administration priorities,” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/nih-terminates-ongoing-grants-for-lgbtq-research/"&gt;a phrase&lt;/a&gt; that was quickly becoming familiar to scientists working on similar research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then the National Cancer Institute (NCI) ended its Outstanding Investigator Award program, a critical source of funding for Quackenbush that covered some of his salary. The program provided seven years of funding and was meant to minimize paperwork and incentivize the best researchers to pursue high-risk, high-reward science, both things that NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya has said are priorities for him. While those with ongoing awards will still continue to receive funds, Quackenbush’s reached the end of its seven years in 2025. He had expected to renew the grant, he said, based on the renewal application’s review scores, until the program ended. Then, the administration denied a no cost extension, which would have allowed him to spend down remaining dollars in the grant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That was devastating. And then, I was on a plane over Lake Michigan and all the mass terminations for Harvard grants came through,” Quackenbush said. “It was the same thing. I had this visceral feeling of fear and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the loss of so much research funding, not hiring is no longer a choice, but a necessity. As students graduate and postdocs leave for other jobs, Quackenbush doesn’t have the dollars to bring on replacements. The research program he has spent decades building at Harvard, that has proven useful to countless other scientists, is in danger of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scientists familiar with Quackenbush’s work know him as a methodologist, a computational tool builder. Over the last two decades, his lab created a suite of applications called the “Network Zoo,” machine learning tools focused around understanding gene regulatory networks, the web of molecular interactions and systems that control how cells use their genes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To explain, Quackenbush points out that every cell in a human body has the same genome. The thing that separates a neuron from a liver cell are the different arrays of genes that are silenced or active in one versus the other. “But that is what is different, not why they are different,” Quackenbush said. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush became interested not just in which genes are active or silenced in cells, but in these complex networks consisting of 1,600 transcription factors, proteins that regulate the over 20,000 genes in the genome. “These transcription factors work alone and together to orchestrate when and how strongly genes turn off and on, activating not just one gene or another, but collections of genes that work together to carry out unique processes,” he said. “It’s a many to many problem. So you have this complex network that potentially has hundreds of thousands of connections.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modeling and studying these networks can help scientists build a deeper understanding of human biology and potential disease causes and therapeutics. But the only way to model such a network is through computational tools like the ones that Quackenbush and his lab build, said Ramos at Texas A&amp;amp;M. Each application in the Network Zoo is named after a different animal, like PANDA or EGRET, and can help scientists explore different aspects of gene regulatory networks. One recent application, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/cbiit/news-events/news/2024/machine-learning-approach-helps-interpret-genome-wide-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PHOENIX&lt;/a&gt;, helps scientists better understand how gene networks change over time and is the first such network model that can scale to all estimated 20,000 genes in the human genome, and was noted by the NCI as a key advance in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush doesn’t see himself primarily as a tool builder, though. To him, the applications are a means to an end, a way to satisfy scientific and biological questions that fascinate him and his colleagues. What truly excites him is being able to use the tools to do science. For instance, he and one of his current postdocs, Tara Eicher, wanted to study how certain genes implicated in glioblastoma, an aggressive type of brain cancer, are related to one another and whether they might help explain certain differences in outcomes between men and women. “Tara grabbed onto this idea and developed a method she calls BLOBFISH, which is the ugliest or cutest looking fish in our animal name paradigm,” Quackenbush said. “It’s a creative way to take networks and find how genes are connected within them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eicher and Quackenbush are now starting to use that method to study glioblastoma, and employing BLOBFISH to study genes related to autism as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All the Network Zoo tools are open source and freely available for scientists to use, and they’re also relatively easy to use, Ramos said. “What [Quackenbush] did was make bioinformatics accessible,” he said. “He’s written them in code that somebody with reasonable bioinformatics expertise can adopt pretty readily. He’s done that by design.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his own work, Ramos used a Network Zoo program called ALPACA to better understand how to overcome drug resistance in cancer. Other researchers, like Brigham and Women’s Hospital physician scientist Dawn DeMeo, have used the Network Zoo to make discoveries in other diseases. A key interest for DeMeo and her lab is sex differences in lung diseases like COPD, asthma, and lung cancer. Before she learned about the Network Zoo applications, DeMeo said it felt impossible to study some of the questions she works on now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a clinician, I knew there were remarkable differences in lung disease between men and women. As someone doing research in genetics and genomics, I felt we didn’t have the tools yet to answer these questions,” DeMeo said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with Quackenbush’s lab made it possible for DeMeo to start finding some of these differences. For one, while actual gene expression, or creation of proteins, is roughly the same in men and women, DeMeo and Quackenbush discovered large differences in how those same genes were regulated between sexes. “We were shocked to find that across many organ systems, we saw this same pattern,” she said. That meant gene regulatory networks might be a key avenue to understand why women respond better to chemotherapy, for example, or why asthma is more common in young boys before puberty but more common in women after puberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shrinking-lab"&gt;The shrinking lab&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the grants that supported Quackenbush’s lab either cancelled or running out soon, the availability of these tools may become more limited. For one, without being able to hire graduate students and fellows, there just won’t be the people power to continue developing new tools to investigate new kinds of questions at the same rate. Quackenbush’s lab also has to maintain the tools, making sure that they remain up to date and compatible with the latest versions of programming languages like Python.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over time, without lab members to keep this up, the Network Zoo will decay, and scientists like DeMeo and Ramos may not be able to continue using them. “Every time there’s a new release of R and Python, we have to go in and upgrade all the code. Otherwise it won’t run,” Quackenbush said. The lab also supports some of the cost of keeping these resources online. “Now, with more than 20 software tools in this repertoire, it takes a lot to maintain them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year ago, nine postdocs and graduate students made up the Quackenbush lab. Now, he’s down to three. Where lab meetings used to fill up a large conference room, they now meet in a smaller office. As he watched the lab shrink over the year, he said one small mercy was that he hasn’t had to fire anyone. “All these people who worked with me have gone on to good positions,” he said. “Even one of the postdocs working with me now just interviewed for a job. People have gone on to great things, and I’m proud of them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the morale among the remaining researchers has fallen. A dark cloud began to hang over the departures. One postdoc told STAT the decision to leave the lab was accelerated by the federal funding cuts and instability in academic science this year. Eicher interviewed for an industry job this year, but withdrew her application. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, she’s worried about funding for her postdoc running out. Eicher has two young children, and her family needs both her and her husband’s income to support them. That also makes it more difficult to find jobs abroad, she said, even as leaving the U.S. to pursue science has become increasingly attractive since the start of the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of people talking about going to Europe, given the current climate,” Eicher said. “That’s not really an option for me. I don’t think moving my kids to another country is really feasible at this point. It’s a lot to consider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Staying at Harvard feels like walking on thin ice, though. Harvard’s School of Public Health, which has relied heavily on grant funding, has steadily increased austerity measures, cutting costs wherever it could. In the department of biostatistics, there are only four new Ph.D. students, compared to the usual dozen or more. And there’s no more coffee provided, a longtime staple of the break room. “It does give a different feeling,” Eicher said, looking at the empty space where the coffee once sat. “It really illustrates that we don’t have money for any type of thing that we don’t absolutely need.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Quackenbush still has a small amount of money from grants that continue to support his remaining lab members and cloud supercomputing costs, but it won’t last forever. He estimates the lab has had about $1.2 million lost or withheld this year, and possibly close to $10 million research dollars lost over multiple, future years. What remains is a small subcontract that expires in May, a grant from Amazon Web Services, and “a small amount of money from the NCI that fell in the gap between my grant programs being terminated and the mass terminations, and subsequent restoration, of funding at Harvard,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s been considering other positions as other institutions have tried to recruit him, including the University of Oxford. So far, though, he hasn’t made any decisions — adding that the financial package didn’t make moving the lab over to England feasible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush said he’s been managing the lab’s dwindling finances by looking for new opportunities, like finding ways to spin out technology startups from his work. “It’s taught me that I am wired in a way that reflects stoic philosophy,” he said. “I look and say, ‘all right, is there something else I can do that will move things forward?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even stoics can struggle, though. At an annual physical earlier this year, Quackenbush recalled checking through several mental health questions. “Are you depressed? Yes. Are you anxious? Yes. Hopeless? Yes. It’s just such a challenging time right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s been frustrating for him is the sense that many in the public and in the administration don’t understand what scientists like him are trying to do and who they are. “The perceptions are all over the place. We’re at Harvard. We’re the elites. In abstract, it’s easy to make scientists a political scapegoat. But if you talk to people and lay out what you do and ask, are you interested in people trying to cure cancer, the answer is yes,” Quackenbush said. “If you ask them about the things we do on a day-to-day basis, the answer is always yes, it’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quackenbush grew up with a single parent in a small Pennsylvania town called Mountain Top. “Wilkes-Barre area, not really quite a town,” he said. “I was supposed to be nothing.” As a high school student, Quackenbush worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant. “One day, the police burst in and arrested our cook and hauled him out. Then my boss said, does anyone know how to cook? I said I can boil water, and he said, you’re promoted,” Quackenbush said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, choosing between going to college and becoming the restaurant’s assistant manager was a big decision. “For me, this was far more than I thought I could achieve — an assistant manager in a restaurant,” he said. But he felt called to Caltech, and so became the first person in his family to graduate college. From there, Quackenbush earned a Ph.D. in physics and did research in theoretical and experimental physics before switching to genetics and starting his lab in computational biology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government and public investment into science supported that journey, something that Quackenbush said he’s grateful for every day. “As a scientist, I feel like I’m the luckiest person in the world. I’ve been able to do really interesting things, and I’ve been paid to do that by the American taxpayers,” he said. “Society has made this investment in me, and my responsibility is to provide a return on that investment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s harder than ever now, with the lab a shadow of what it once was. Getting new large grants may not necessarily be a quick fix, as private foundation dollars are more in demand than ever, and public grant applications are an intensive and competitive process that may take a year or more. Much of the money he still has will run out in the spring, he said. “I have no idea what’s going to happen beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, he said, the lab will continue working. “Every day we come in to fight through the current situation as much as possible. We want to continue research. We want to continue to make advances,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they will, even if at a much slower pace, Quackenbush said, until they can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Scientists are examining how tattoos may affect the immune system and warn that what might seem a purely cosmetic procedure could influence the way the body fights disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study by the Institute for Research in Biomedicine at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland investigated the toxicity of tattoo inks, focusing on the three most commonly used colours: black, red, and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This work represents the most extensive study to date regarding the effect of tattoo ink on the immune response and raises serious health concerns associated with the tattooing practice,” researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in PNAS, found that tattoo ink not only remains in the skin but also travels through the body, accumulating in the immune system, where it can stay for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within these tissues, the ink triggers cell death, as macrophages — key immune cells — cannot digest the captured pigment, causing inflammation that may weaken the body’s defences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction appeared stronger in tattoos made with red and black ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests with mice, scientists observed that pigments rapidly travelled to the animals’ lymph nodes, where they accumulated for two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following tattooing, the mice’s immune response to COVID-19 vaccines weakened, although the same inks appeared to enhance the response to a UV-inactivated flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Swiss researchers stated that these findings must be validated through human studies and across different vaccine types.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is also studying the potential long-term health effects of tattooing, particularly its links to immune response, lymphomas, and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the pigment particles are nanoparticle-sized and they can move beyond the dermis.Exposure to tattoo ink may be systemic rather than local, according to IARC’s research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattoo prevalence is highest in Europe and the United States, reaching up to 40 per cent among adults under 40. “As this trend grows, the relevance of tattoo safety for public health is increasing proportionally,” the IARC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do tattoos alter theskin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattooing involves injecting ink into the dermis — the deeper layer of skin — using needles that create tiny punctures. This process triggers an immune response, as the body recognises the ink particles as foreign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process induces localised inflammation as the immune system attempts to heal the skin injury caused by the needles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tattoo inks, composed of colour pigments diluted in a carrier liquid, may contain up to 100 chemicals. While black tattoos are typically done with carbon pigment, colored tattoos typically contain industrial organic pigments originally designed for plastics, varnishes, or paints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the ink has been regulated since 2022 by the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation, which intends to harmonise the legislation across member states. &lt;/p&gt;

You slip into familiar routes, adjust speed without much thought, and weave through traffic on autopilot. But recent research shows these quiet habits behind the wheel might reveal more about your brain health than you realize. Subtle shifts in how and when you drive could signal early cognitive decline years before memory problems become obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Driving as a window into brain function&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/7-selfish-habits-that-make-you-a-healthier-person/photostory/125782540.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;7 'selfish habits' that make you a healthier person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving ranks among the most demanding tasks our brains handle daily. It requires sharp attention, quick visual processing, spatial awareness, planning, decision-making, and split-second reactions. When cognitive abilities start to fade even slightly, people naturally adjust their driving without always noticing why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Common factors that cause brain aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12662389/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;on November 26, 2025, tracked nearly 300 older adults using GPS devices in their cars over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12662389/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;analyzed real-world driving patterns to see if they predicted mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an early stage of memory loss that often precedes dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study's start, drivers with normal cognition and those with subtle memory issues drove similarly. Over time, however, those who developed or already had MCI showed clear changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They drove fewer trips per month, avoided nighttime driving more often, stuck to shorter distances, repeated the same simple routes, explored fewer new places, and spent less time at higher speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these shifts telling? Healthy older drivers often self-regulate wisely. They skip night drives or highways to feel safer. But the MCI group showed steeper, more consistent drops that went beyond caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an intriguing study, machine learning models that were exclusively trained on driving data, without the inclusion of memory assessments or brain imaging scans, were able to accurately identify drivers with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with a remarkable precision of 80 to 87 percent. In certain instances, this innovative approach actually surpassed the effectiveness of traditional screening methodologies that rely solely on factors such as age or genetic predisposition. The lead researcher, Ganesh M. Babulal, observed that "Driving patterns serve as digital biomarkers that reflect brain health in our daily lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research supports this. A 2022 Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience study found driving cessation predicts dementia risk up to six years ahead.

Plenty of sharp seniors avoid rush hour or bad weather for comfort. The difference lies in patterns over months or years. Sudden reliance on one short route, new anxiety about familiar roads, or family stepping in "just to be safe" warrant attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/125745789.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;amp;utm_medium=text&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cppst" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Gastroenterologist shares 4 signs of colon cancer in the 30s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified an intriguing overlap between the concepts of smart self-regulation and the phenomenon of unconscious compensation. For instance, an individual who is experiencing a decline in their planning skills might find themselves skipping errands without even realizing it. Early detection of such behaviors can pave the way for timely intervention and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red flags:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Family and friends often notice first.

Systematic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192665/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that higher fructose intake is consistently associated with hyperuricemia and gout in prospective cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why festivals are the “perfect storm”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festive menus lean heavily on exactly the foods and drinks that push uric acid up: meat-heavy spreads, rich gravies, prawns or shellfish, sugary sweets, and free‑flowing alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224425003279" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; measuring purine content confirm that many meats, fish, and some shellfish easily cross the “high‑purine” threshold that’s considered risky for hyperuricemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, holidays usually mean bigger portions, late‑night eating, and less structured meals, so total purine and fructose load in a 24‑hour window can jump dramatically compared to usual routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even short periods of hypercaloric, high‑fat intake have been shown to raise serum uric acid, likely via changes in xanthine oxidase activity and reduced renal excretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol adds another layer. Ethanol metabolism burns through ATP and generates AMP, which then gets degraded into uric acid, so even “purine‑free” alcohol can raise serum uric acid quickly. Clinical and epidemiologic studies show alcohol intake roughly doubles the risk of hyperuricemia and gout compared with low or no intake, with stronger effects for beer and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also makes the kidneys less efficient at getting rid of uric acid, so you’re both making more and clearing less at the same time. When alcohol is combined with purine‑rich foods—the classic festival pattern—the hepatic and renal burden is even higher, which is why flares often show up the morning after a big celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sugar, snacks, and “holiday metabolism”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festivals are a fructose festival, too: traditional sweets, packaged desserts, fruit juices, and soft drinks can deliver large, rapid hits of fructose. Experimental and mechanistic studies show that fructose acutely boosts purine synthesis and breakdown, driving uric acid up even in otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer on top the usual holiday pattern of less activity and more sitting, which promotes weight gain and insulin resistance, both of which are independently associated with higher serum uric acid. Adipose tissue itself can secrete more uric acid under obese and hypoxic conditions, further tightening the link between “holiday weight” and uric acid spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of high uric acid level&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High uric acid doesn’t always show up with big, dramatic signs in the beginning, most people don’t even realise something’s wrong until the levels shoot up. But your body does drop small hints, and paying attention early can save you from a lot of pain later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common symptoms is sudden, intense pain in the joints, especially the big toe. You might wake up in the middle of the night feeling like your toe is on fire or even too tender to touch. This is often called a gout attack, and it can last for days. Apart from the toe, uric acid pain can hit your ankles, knees, wrists or fingers too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign is swelling, stiffness, or redness around joints, making simple movements feel heavy and uncomfortable. Some people also experience a constant dull ache, like the joints are tired for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High uric acid can also show up as persistent fatigue, morning discomfort, or a feeling of heaviness in the body. If the kidneys are getting affected, you may notice lower back pain, or difficulty while urinating, sometimes even kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to enjoy festival without stressing about uric acid spike&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is pretty clear: it’s the combination and concentration of triggers that matters most, not a single “bad” food. Helpful science‑backed tweaks include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting portions so meat and seafood are side players, not the main event, and emphasizing lower‑purine plant foods and dairy, which are associated with lower uric acid and gout risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping some sugary drinks and sweets for whole fruit, water, or unsweetened beverages to keep fructose load down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spacing alcohol, alternating with water, and keeping at least a few alcohol‑free days around the festival period to give the liver and kidneys a breather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You still get the joy and the food memories, but with far fewer post‑festival twinges from your joints and lab reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is meant for general informational purposes only and should not be taken as professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart-healthy foods contain fiber, antioxidants, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frozen foods retain their nutrients and offer an easy, nutritious option for your meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make room in your freezer for berries, spinach, salmon and edamame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’re never too young to start focusing on heart health. This includes engaging in regular exercise, lowering your stress levels, getting plenty of quality sleep and eating a diet rich in heart-healthy nutrients—like omega-3s, fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you may naturally gravitate toward fresh produce and seafood, believing they’re nutritionally superior to their frozen counterparts, you may be surprised to learn that your freezer can be a true treasure trove when it comes to heart-healthy, nutritious foods. “Freezing preserves vitamins and minerals, and they’re incredibly convenient for busy days when fresh produce may not be available,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krutika-nanavati/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Krutika Nanavati, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition researcher. “They also help reduce food waste and make it easier to maintain a consistent heart-healthy diet year-round.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By taking good care of your heart, you may lower your risk of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure. “You’re also safeguarding your [other] organs, improving your energy levels, and reducing the risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and kidney disease,” says Nanavati.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We asked three nutrition and cardiovascular professionals to give us their top picks for heart-healthy frozen foods. While you clean out your freezer to make room for them, we’ll explain what makes them heart-healthy and give you a few delicious ideas for using them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Raspberries, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-blueberries-11690014" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blueberries&lt;/a&gt;, strawberries, blackberries—choose your favorite and stock up. “Frozen berries are readily available, always in season, and they are packed with antioxidants that can reduce inflammation and lower your risk for heart disease,” says  &lt;a href="https://www.leonardpiankomd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leonard Pianko, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Florida-based cardiologist. “Berries retain their anthocyanins and phenolic compounds (antioxidants) when they are frozen, thereby reducing your risk for hypertension and atherosclerosis—aka hardening of the arteries.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Research suggests that berries contain several cardioprotective antioxidants, vitamins, and numerous phytochemicals, including the aforementioned phenolic compounds, which have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiplatelet properties—all important for maintaining healthy blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I love mixing [berries] into yogurt or oatmeal,” says Nanavati. “Very quickly, they soften and deliver an incredible burst of flavor that makes it very easy to get your nutrient-dense, heart-healthy boost first thing in the morning.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-spinach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Spinach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Popeye was onto something with his spinach. Spinach and other green leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which have been shown to support heart health by reducing blood pressure, relaxing blood vessel walls and improving blood flow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nanavati calls frozen spinach one of her kitchen lifesavers. On days when she’s short on either time or energy, she says it's helpful to have the greens already washed and chopped and ready to toss into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899857/spinach-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, dals, soups and omelets. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen fatty fish, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8040993/is-salmon-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, is good for your heart because it is loaded with omega-3 fatty acids and low in saturated fat, says Pianko. “Fatty acids cannot be produced by your body, which is why it is essential to eat foods that are high in this nutrient,” says Pianko. “The proper freezing process locks in the nutrients, which can lower your triglycerides, reduce inflammation, improve your heart health, and can be as healthy as fresh fish.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; are well-documented for heart-healthy benefits. For example, one systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials testing omega-3 fatty acids in nearly 150,000 participants found that these essential fats were associated with a lower risk of heart attack and other heart-related events, plus a reduced risk of dying from them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-edamame"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Edamame &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Edamame are young soybeans that are picked before they’re fully ripened; they’re loaded with fiber, plant protein, potassium and antioxidants. “Frozen edamame is just so undervalued, and I always recommend them,” says Nanavati. “They're super rich in plant-based protein and fiber; both of these are very good for supporting healthy cholesterol levels. Sometimes I sprinkle a little salt or chili flakes on it, and other times I toss it into salads, grain bowls or stir-fries.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research is mixed regarding its specific health benefits, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-high-protein-snack-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8786440" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;edamame’s heart-healthy benefits&lt;/a&gt; are partly attributed to its soluble fiber, known to help lower cholesterol, and potassium, which can help lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-easy-ways-to-add-frozen-foods-to-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Easy Ways to Add Frozen Foods to Your Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frozen foods are one of the fastest ways to add nutrition, reduce prep time and cut down on waste—if you use them strategically. Here are a few ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Add frozen vegetables directly to soups, stews, pastas or grain bowls for instant volume and nutrients without chopping.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toss frozen berries into smoothies or yogurt bowls, or use them in frozen desserts—like nice creams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use frozen fish for weeknight dinners. Frozen fish thaws quickly, cooks fast and offers a reliable source of lean protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swap in frozen edamame to boost the fiber, nutrients and protein in your meals, making them more filling and nutritious. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Cardiologists and dietitians agree that your freezer is one of the easiest places to improve your heart health. Frozen produce, soy foods, whole grains and fatty fish all retain their nutrients, reduce food waste and make it simpler to build heart-healthy meals on busy days. Adding a few of these staples to your weekly routine may go a long way toward lowering LDL cholesterol, supporting healthy blood pressure and reducing inflammation. It’s a small shift that can add up to long-term cardiovascular benefits.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A shingles vaccination program that began in Wales in 2013 has led to two discoveries that give fresh hope to efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dementia-pill-clears-first-major-safety-hurdle-trial-reports"&gt;treat dementia&lt;/a&gt;: The vaccine appears to reduce the risk of mild cognitive impairment, as well as slowing progression of dementia in those already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shingles-vaccine-guards-against-dementia-study-reveals"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery that the vaccine may help prevent dementia in April, after results were published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new follow-up study on the same data, this same vaccine has been linked to reduced cases of death by dementia in patients with an existing diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study, from an international team of scientists, adds to a growing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.3040"&gt;body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that stopping  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184143" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that affect the nervous system – such as the varicella zoster  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="184143" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-shingles-myths-your-doctor-wants-you-to-stop-believing"&gt;causes shingles&lt;/a&gt; – could also protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-itself-could-be-a-crucial-element-in-preventing-dementia-study-finds"&gt;Time Itself Could Be a Crucial Element in Preventing Dementia, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the vaccine is safe, affordable, and already widely available, this finding could have major implications for public health," &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/2985389-shingles-vaccine-may-help-prevent-and-slow-dementia,-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Haroon Ahmed, from Cardiff University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More research is needed to test our work and understand more about the potential protective effect the vaccine offers against dementia, particularly how and why it works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184146" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DementiaChart.jpg" alt="Vaccine dementia chart" class="wp-image-184146 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DementiaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DementiaChart-600x601.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184146" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The vaccine protected against dementia and mild cognitive impairment. (Xie et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh vaccination program rolled out more than a decade ago by the UK National Health Service gave researchers the opportunity to analyze a &lt;a href="https://www.mrcctu.ucl.ac.uk/patients-public/about-clinical-trials/what-is-a-randomised-clinical-trial/"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, without actually running one: to ration vaccines, those aged 79 could get it, while those aged 80 couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That quirk meant that the effects of the vaccine could be studied in two very similar groups, with an age difference of just one year between them. It goes a long way to reducing the influence of other factors that play into dementia risk, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;education level&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-health-in-middle-age-could-predict-your-later-dementia-risk"&gt;medical conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="docos-replyview-body docos-anchoredreplyview-body docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable-background" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 14,350 people diagnosed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;with dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; prior to the start of the vaccine program, about half died of the condition within nine years. Being vaccinated against shingles made this nearly 30 percent less likely, according to the analysis, suggesting a significant level of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the vaccinated participants were less likely or slower to develop mild cognitive impairment, a common precursor to dementia. Combined with the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shingles-vaccine-guards-against-dementia-study-reveals"&gt;earlier findings&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine reduced the risk of dementia starting at all, these are encouraging signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most exciting part is that this really suggests the shingles vaccine doesn't have only preventive, delaying benefits for dementia, but also therapeutic potential for those who already have dementia," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Pascal Geldsetzer from Stanford University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the serendipitous design of the Welsh vaccination program, the data isn't robust enough to show direct cause and effect – but it does show a significant connection that's worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the next challenges is going to be figuring out why the shingles vaccine might be having this impact on dementia development and diagnosis. There might be nervous system or immune system mechanisms at play – viruses affecting the nervous system &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.030"&gt;have been linked&lt;/a&gt; in animal models to the toxic protein build-up seen with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="184143" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies could potentially look at larger groups of people across a wider range of ages, as well as investigating the latest shingles vaccine: the vaccine used in Wales in 2013 has since been retired for a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shingrix-vaccine-for-people-with-weakened-immune-systems/shingrix-vaccine-for-people-with-weakened-immune-systems"&gt;new and improved version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least investing a subset of our resources into investigating these pathways could lead to breakthroughs in terms of treatment and prevention," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Geldsetzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.007"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While some people assume that shifting their bedtime on weekends or staying up late occasionally has little impact, the expert said the body responds almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Regular sleep times help maintain the body’s natural blood-pressure rhythm, which can be disrupted when bedtimes shift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people trying to build a more consistent sleep routine, Lu recommends starting with the morning wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start with a fixed wake time every day, including weekends, and anchor the schedule with morning light exposure — then set a consistent bedtime that gives you enough sleep before that wake time," he advised. "Pick a wake time you can sustain and get 30 minutes of morning light after waking up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here For More Health Stories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here For More Health Stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommends adding a brief wind-down routine before bed and cutting back on stimulants and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/technologies/smartphones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:screen use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;screen use&lt;/a&gt; in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving sleep timing is a low-risk change that may help lower blood pressure, Lu said, adding that consistent bedtimes should be used in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-hypertensive medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-hypertensive medications&lt;/a&gt;, not as a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size was relatively small, consisting of 11 middle-aged adults with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity and hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity and hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a two-week period, which means researchers could measure only short-term changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also lacked a control group or randomization, so it couldn't prove that the blood-pressure improvements were caused by more consistent bedtimes or by other lifestyle factors, such as diet, stress or medication changes. Larger, longer-term studies are needed to confirm the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering changes to their sleep schedule for blood-pressure benefits should first speak with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/simple-nightly-habit-linked-healthier-blood-pressure-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Simple nightly habit linked to healthier blood pressure, study suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Simple nightly habit linked to healthier blood pressure, study suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 22:04:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNa2Q4aExmcjU1RnhTRFE0WFRrM0ZqaWowN2tpTWtjN3g2OWwzanE2NW41UnJkSkZ0WTNmUTg4cUVrY2d0THJVQmtPMzdGQWZGVzdZc2ZNYmtIU1FxT1hfb21QZGU2d2pRcVJENmlxN3l3aUpfYzBOc0VGeC1ZZ2RhRmF5WFVQWjZR</guid></item><item><title>“爱情荷尔蒙”带来的性治疗-《华尔街日报》</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/sexual-healingwith-a-boost-from-the-love-hormone-8953a10e</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOMHZDektnanotSWYwM0lnZDNxVGdIdDFvM1Fzbm8wcUpPa2FDdnkzSHBkNldwWFR5Zlp6Wnd6SWREWURkOXpIRlpTY2k1Ti03S2I5X0I2SGtwMzlPMWl2QTJmVEpHOXFYRzY1MEFtbjZVN0hxTF94Wm9DMXVoV1BXWmo2NzVVMmJ6R21rWXpIQjRzVU5rTXVWZA</guid></item><item><title>小RFK有条不紊地寻求颠覆美国疫苗体系--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/rfk-vaccines-hhs-trump.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:55:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBLYTVXV0Uzb2xlZFE5em9oY240SEVNNUdSQmFUTWlSUUd6d2tLZUcxTmctdnlrUTJOOF9idnB4aDE0ZGdfUnNrcW1BX0RhbWFacnFFdVFRZjhqVlJCYTM3U0xweVpzdTZWSGoyTEszbWpiaVFBOTJnaVNLaHprSG8</guid></item><item><title>带状疱疹疫苗不仅可以降低痴呆症风险，还可以帮助治疗它- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/shingles-vaccine-doesnt-just-lower-dementia-risk-it-could-also-help-treat-it-2000695823</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The same vaccine that keeps you safe from shingles could also do wonders for your brain, research out this week suggests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Stanford University and others examined what happened after shingles vaccination was introduced to the country of Wales over a decade ago. They found evidence the shingles vaccine not only reduced people’s risk of developing dementia but also lowered their odds of dying from dementia if they did have it. Boosting your immunity to shingles might offer a broad protective effect against cognitive decline, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study suggests that [shingles] vaccination slows or prevents disease progression across the entire disease course of dementia,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in Cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A natural experiment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies in recent years have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-shots-dont-just-prevent-pain-they-might-save-your-life-2000674980"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that shingles vaccination has benefits beyond preventing the painful viral illness. But the researchers say their approach has allowed them to look at a natural experiment that occurred in Wales in 2013. That fall, the vaccination program officially began in the country, with clear age restrictions. People born on or after September 2, 1933 (80 years and under) were eligible for at least one year for the shingles vaccine, whereas people born before then were not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cut-offs (and the UK’s robust record-keeping) meant the researchers could easily track dementia rates among similar groups of older people right before and after the vaccine became available, with the non-eligible group acting as a sort of control. In a study &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this April, the researchers found that vaccinated people were 20% less likely to be diagnosed with dementia over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This time, however, they were interested in seeing whether the vaccine was linked to better outcomes across the different stages of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the same method, they found that vaccinated people were less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the earliest potential stage of dementia (though many with dementia will first experience MCI, not everyone with MCI will go on to have full-blown dementia). And among diagnosed dementia cases, people vaccinated against shingles were also less likely to ultimately die as a result of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“That means that the vaccine doesn’t just have a preventive potential, but actually a therapeutic potential as a treatment, because we see some benefits already among those who have dementia,” senior study author Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-progression-study-wellness"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CNN. “To me, this was really exciting to see and unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;An already worthwhile vaccine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings still can’t definitively prove that the shingles vaccine can affect dementia outcomes. That said, the team’s unique method does get around many of the limitations of observational studies. And taken as a whole, the evidence is mounting that the shingles vaccine has more health benefits than we initially realized.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just this past October, for instance, a study &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-shots-dont-just-prevent-pain-they-might-save-your-life-2000674980"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people vaccinated for shingles are also less likely to develop heart disease and stroke; they were also less likely to die earlier compared to non-vaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Shingles is one of the most painful experiences a person can have. And the vaccine is universally recommended for every American starting at age 50. So there’s already plenty of incentive to get your shots (it’s a two-dose vaccine). Lowering your risk of brain and heart disease just seems to be a great bonus, too.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

However, a diagnostic test exists. which detects cancer before any symptoms emerge. The Galleri multi-cancer early detection test provides family cancer patients with a valuable screening method, to identify various cancer types simultaneously which leads to better treatment results, and longer survival rates. Dr. Vass, M.D. tells us why the Galleri multi-cancer test can literally save your life!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is the Galleri test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri blood &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c205g21n1zzo" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; identifies more than 50 cancer types, by detecting tumor DNA fragments which appear in blood as cell-free DNA. The test uses artificial intelligence to detect cancer-specific chemical methylation signatures, which enable precise cancer location identification at a rate of 92%. The test results in more focused and time-efficient diagnostic procedures for patients. The test functions as a supplementary tool to standard cancer screening methods including mammograms, pap smears and colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why early detection matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment success rate for cancer patients improves when doctors detect the disease during its initial stages, because symptoms emerge only when cancer reaches an advanced stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test identifies cancer at its initial stage in more than half of all detected cases (clinical trials showed early-stage cancer detection rates exceeding 50%). The discovery of cancer at an early stage enables medical professionals to initiate treatment procedures which minimize patient death rates. The PATHFINDER 2 study demonstrated that Galleri screening, increased cancer detection by more than seven times when used with standard cancer tests which led to the identification of pancreatic, liver, ovarian, bladder and stomach cancers without screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How effective is the Galleri test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test demonstrates 99.6% specificity which results in a 0.4% false-positive rate, that minimizes the need for additional medical &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/1000/diagnostic-tests-galleri-test-cancer.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The positive predictive value of the test reaches 61.6% which means that 61.6% of people testing positive, will receive a cancer diagnosis. The test revealed cancer indicators in 0.93% of participants during research while confirming cancer in 0.57% of cases. The test detects cancers that standard screening methods fail to identify, which makes it an essential tool for early cancer detection and ongoing monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Who should consider this test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have cancer in their family history, should make Galleri and other MCED tests their top priority. Traditional cancer screening methods only check for a limited number of cancer types, but many cancers develop because of inherited genetic factors. The test enables patients to screen for various cancer types at once, which helps identify cancers that standard screening methods cannot detect. The test provides excellent benefits to people aged 50 and above, and those with additional risk factors who want to monitor their health actively. Patients need to consult their healthcare provider before adding this test to their cancer prevention strategy. The Galleri test functions as an additional screening tool, but patients should follow established screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Limitations and future outlook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri test represents a breakthrough in medical science, although users need to understand its restricted capabilities. The test has not received complete approval from all regulatory organisations, and it does not guarantee complete cancer detection for all types and stages. Patients who receive positive test results need to undergo additional diagnostic procedures, which might include imaging tests and tissue sample examinations. The test continues to show promise through ongoing research, which aims to enhance its precision and medical benefits. The accumulation of additional research data will lead to worldwide cancer screening transformations which will enable doctors to detect diseases at earlier stages for better treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxOXzY2eVFZT2FVVHgyZ1B6dGp6MlVkTncyaWFiZlBySng3anlhU0dpRGVCQ0MwZEdnWmcycndGRXFWQVlfcGViWVRsQ0cwRTQ2Wms1RnVYRmxhdnYtNzdtMEF4MTlybEpjckNtVUZIUDRBYWVQS3RBcHVhMVUtNjBUTWh0dk9FNEZrbnZDVEtqdDB3ekhyWHd2ZmVrTGNJdUplZHlnV0lvYjhReUZIazV2c3ZXZHRIa09kbjJhWGx1YVJkQWFRZjVjWVhnQnpzOFFMeHZWUVZlblU5c0pzRVhTUWFZdXFudDVsdWt0c1FoYzRpQm5rRnY4ZVFmRUtQOTBpYUM1bE9Gc1hjMXVtVEhr0gGUAkFVX3lxTE5yTVZ2eDlDOU1yZjdOQUE1WXprMmxLS1dVbDl2QUsyUnpYejVEa3NmU0NfT3hSUDJCWUpZUU5xM3hIS1EzRzZCckgyNkplQXROSFQtY0NvcmREdHBPZTAtUWx0S3RWc2NaOFN3dFpfd1hvb0JJNXRibXE2aHpSWV82UzlzczlKRnJUQ29DYUJMeWN5T2E1NXhiLV9nNHNGUmhHRmRMN1R4LUNDRDIzTnVfOWVOZEJyYWxKOXlFTVJVdWs5ZkdON1RLc1JFd1RFNFdabnQxbUJaTUl3bjkyMlFtdnMyVWg3bXBOdndoTjBBTHViM0Y5Sk93SjZVdlhEVG02NEFvNnJBNWo5UzVJb2xzMGp3cw</guid></item><item><title>随着医院被感染淹没，中国正在与恐怖病毒爆发作斗争--《镜报》</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/chinese-hospitals-battling-against-virus-36354116</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_b5b325" publication="mirror"&gt;China fighting horror virus outbreak as hospitals overwhelmed by infection&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_8efb9b" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Hospitals across China are overwhelmed with patients battling an airborne virus across 17 provinces - with children among the hardest hit and the capital Beijing going through a peak flu period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_byline-container__K_Owl" data-testid="byline"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-content" class="Byline_byline-content-wrapper__Imque"&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_author-badge-date-wrapper__Q7jj1"&gt;&lt;p class="Byline_dates-container__Rqzf2"&gt;&lt;span class="" data-testid="byline-publishedDate"&gt;18:49, 04 Dec 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Byline_updated-date__8vEV8 Byline_updated-date-with-published__ApG_G" data-testid="byline-updatedDate"&gt;Updated 21:00, 04 Dec 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="LightboxBtn_lightbox-btn__eoxYS" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="36354153"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Hospitals across China have been hit with waves of patients battling fever and influenza prompting fears of a viral outbreak across the country.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruou8n000o3b790ts5em6v@published"&gt;Over the past year, the agency has lost a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/health/cdc-kennedy.html"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; of its staff. During the government shutdown, the administration &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to fire hundreds more. Scroll around and you’ll find &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/savehealthresearch/p/DRvuJrLDiby/"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the notes employees have allegedly been leaving behind. Some simply present data supporting their work, like “1.4 million children are living with HIV.” In the women’s bathroom, though, the messages are reportedly more pointed. They include &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-rfk-jr-cdc-anti-vaccine-guidelines-policy-cuts-director-fired.html"&gt;Post-its&lt;/a&gt; reminding workers that “It’s okay to not be okay.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoubn000p3b79nrh9imxb@published"&gt;But despite all this, this agency is still going about its business. On Thursday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is set to issue recommendations about the kinds of immunizations infants get, for instance. And there’s nothing any of us can do to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouej000q3b79k41e01oa@published"&gt;“Anti-vaccine activists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been around forever, arguably since the first vaccine, usually shouting from the sidelines, but now they’re not shouting from the sidelines anymore, they’re making policy,” says Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouhp000r3b79z12tlybp@published"&gt;Former CDC directors, like Rochelle Walensky and Tom Frieden, have said they don’t trust the agency anymore, he notes, “so you can’t look to them, other than with your heart in your throat waiting for the next dangerous, misguided thing they say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouk7000s3b79igy9je25@published"&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next/2025/12/how-rfks-cdc-is-making-america-less-healthy"&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt; of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Offit about what we can do as Robert F. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services leans into its anti-vaccine agenda. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoupj000u3b79grtkcnvo@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Harris: I want to break down exactly what this panel’s going to be talking about. The first day of the meeting, they will talk about the hepatitis B vaccine, which is given at birth to babies. I wonder if you can lay out why this vaccine has been so important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruousj000v3b79o72gjfzl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Offit: &lt;/strong&gt;If your mother has hepatitis B and you then go through a birth canal that is invariably bloody that contains hepatitis B, and you’re then infected by passing through that birth canal, you need to be vaccinated at birth. And the reason is that if you’re not, you have an 85 percent chance of getting hepatitis B, passing through a birth canal that has the virus in it. And if you get it, you have a 90 percent chance of going on to develop chronic liver disease, which is to say cirrhosis or liver cancer, and it shortens your life. And if you get hepatitis B in the first five years of life, you have a 25 percent chance of going on to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer, which will shorten your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouv5000w3b79ra0kihxm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people would say, “Well, then just test the mother. See if the mother has hepatitis B. If she does, then you vaccinate the baby.” What would you say to that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouyh000x3b79ga84kccw@published"&gt;Great, but it makes a few assumptions. There’s about a 5 percent false-negative rate, meaning falsely reassuring. Two, it assumes that you haven’t been infected in your second and third trimester. Three, it also assumes that when the child is between 1 and 5 years of age and goes to a day care center, everybody that person comes in contact with at that day care center is not chronically infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov2q000y3b79nt9jnffv@published"&gt;Most people who are chronically infected with hepatitis B in this country, and there are millions, don’t know they’re infected, and they are highly contagious—50 to 100 times more contagious than human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov5l000z3b79xwnea7fc@published"&gt;The vaccine is as safe and as effective at birth as it is at two months of age. So why take that risk? Why would you ever take that risk? Because it’s a risk without benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov8e00103b793u0zkjad@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed that in the past year or so, you’ve been making a point to meet with people you disagree with, people who are leaders in the Make America Healthy Again movement. I wonder what you’ve learned from those conversations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovbk00113b795je584yz@published"&gt;Generally, they don’t trust public health officials. They think that there’s a big conspiracy to hide the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoveq00123b79u2in6e4r@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you could say anything, and it wouldn’t matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovhk00133b79xh7qzsc8@published"&gt;I don’t think it matters. The conversations were collegial, but at the end of it, they don’t trust me, or they don’t trust people in public health, because they think that we’re lying to them. I don’t know how you get over that hump. There’s not a deep state. There are not forces working against you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovkh00143b79wkfgs0py@published"&gt;The people who are in public health want desperately to get it right. Know that we don’t know everything, and we have to be open-minded as we learn new things. But vaccines don’t cause autism. That’s not a thing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovnq00153b794l4mny0a@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve said that you think the only thing that will break through to everyday Americans who may be feeling very strongly about vaccines or may have misinformation about vaccines is for kids to get sick, and even to die. I hear you saying something like that, and as a patient and a person, I feel kind of abandoned. I just feel like, &lt;em&gt;Hold it. Families I know are going to have to pay this horrible price?&lt;/em&gt; How would you respond to someone like me? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovqu00163b79u8o5pt1w@published"&gt;This tears me apart. I think that everybody in public health who’s watching what’s going on is horrified by what’s happening. And we’re not the establishment anymore. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the establishment. Anti-vaccine activists are the establishment. They’re the ones that are making policy, and no one’s pushing back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovts00173b79hbk8g9ce@published"&gt;And so what can we do? Seventy-five Nobel Prize winners decried the appointment or confirmation of RFK Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services. Thousands of doctors have written this. All the professional medical and scientific societies have decried this and written letters about this and had thousands and tens of thousands of signatures. A lot of people go on national television to decry how awful this is. I just feel like we’re screaming into the void.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovwj00183b79x1xnn21a@published"&gt;And it is such a defeat to think that these children are dying unnecessarily. And so I understand you’re feeling abandoned. I do. I feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovz800193b79yvegt7pa@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess I wonder, given our whole conversation and what we’ve said, whether broader action is needed and how you feel about that. How do we mobilize together to create some kind of attentional event, whether it is a strike of health care workers or something else, that would make clear to the country exactly what’s on the line in this moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow22001a3b79fk81vyrc@published"&gt;I think what would have the most impact is a parents’ march, where parents all get together—Republican, Democrat, independent—and say, “We are worried about what’s happening to our children. We are worried that vaccines are becoming more expensive, less available, more feared. We’re worried about the future.” This is a fragile market. I don’t think people quite realize how fragile the vaccine market is. It’s something you get once or a few times in your lifetime. It’s never going to compete with drugs you’re taking every day. This is a weak stepchild for these pharmaceutical companies. They can drop vaccines they have. They did. In many ways that is RFK Jr.’s goal. Parents need to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow71001b3b797peehgw7@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a parent came to you right now and asked for advice in this moment, what would you tell them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow8a001c3b799a5benlj@published"&gt;I think there are a lot of different places one can look to get good advice. There’s our Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, but there are other excellent sources. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in Minnesota has excellent information about this upcoming hepatitis B vaccine story.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruowbv001d3b79tpnonf1z@published"&gt;There are a number of places where you can educate yourself. And I do think that it’s still somewhat of a democracy here in this country, and you still can pretty much say what you want, although people seem to be more scared these days. But there’s still a lot of good information out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoweg001e3b79ok23vrst@published"&gt;And a lot of people&lt;em&gt; are&lt;/em&gt; standing up. You see academic and professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics coming up with their own recommendations based on their own expert advisory groups. Same thing for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Disease Society of America. You can look to those sites to find accurate evidence-based information. And states are standing up. There are coalitions being formed in the Northeast and Northwest about how to have your own expert advisers. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro is looking into creating a vaccine for children program that can provide vaccines to uninsured or underinsured children, because they don’t trust the CDC.&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Participants recalled learned word-image pairs more accurately when reminder cues were presented during or just before inhalation, while the brain’s actual reconstruction of the memory occurred during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainwave recordings revealed that successful remembering involved reduced alpha and beta activity alongside the reactivation of original learning patterns. These findings suggest that breathing acts as a natural timing mechanism that coordinates perception and memory inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breath-Linked Recall:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory cues are most effective when presented during or just before inhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhalation Retrieval:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain reconstructs memories primarily during exhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Signatures:&lt;/strong&gt; Successful recall involves suppressed alpha and beta waves and memory reactivation patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;LMU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost, we breathe in order to absorb oxygen – but this vital rhythm could also have other functions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, a range of studies have shown that respiration influences neural processes, including the processing of stimuli and memory processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LMU researchers led by Dr. Thomas Schreiner, leader of an Emmy Noether junior research group at the Department of Psychology, in collaboration with colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and the University of Oxford, have analyzed how respiration influences the retrieval of previously learned materials and recorded what happens in the brain during this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, 18 participants learned to associate 120 images with certain words. The participants were then asked to recall these associations, and then asked to recall them again after a two-hour afternoon nap. While this was happening, the researchers recorded their breathing as well as their brain activity via EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respiratory rhythm helps with multi-stage remembering process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the study results show that the participants were better able to recall the words and the corresponding images when the reminder cues were presented during or just before inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the EEG, it becomes apparent, however, that the actual memory retrieval tends to happen during subsequent exhalation,” reports Schreiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our data thus points to a sort of functional bifurcation: Inhalation is a favorable moment to receive the reminder cue, while exhalation is a favorable moment for the actual reconstruction of the memory in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that respiratory rhythm shapes the temporal interplay of perception and effective remembering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the EEG recordings, the researchers found two characteristic signatures of successful remembering, which offer insights into the underlying neural patterns: One was the weakening of certain brainwaves – more specifically, alpha and beta activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the brain might activate a memory and focus more strongly on retrieval. The second signature consisted of so-called memory reactivations. In successful remembering, the same neural patterns resurfaced here as were active during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, the participants concentrated wholly on the memory task while maintaining their natural respiratory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To find out whether useful everyday strategies can be derived from our findings, we would need studies with targeted respiratory manipulation,” says first author Esteban Bullón Tarrasó. He also notes the need for more research into older memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the underlying mechanisms suggest that respiration also plays a role there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual variations can exist in the extent to which memory-relevant brain processes are synchronized with respiration. The researchers found differences in degree between the participants, from which they conclude that respiration is linked more efficiently to neural processes in some people than in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if brain and respiration interact better, then presumably remembering works better accordingly: “Respiration is a natural pacemaker for memory processes, highlighting how closely our bodies and brains interact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764878903509"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Does breathing affect how well we remember things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Specifically, we found that both key neural signatures of successful remembering were co-modulated during exhalation, with the strength of the interaction between respiration and reactivation processes being associated with memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that respiration may act as a scaffold for episodic memory retrieval in humans by coordinating the neural conditions that support effective remembering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 20:12:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE85c1AzVnNEQ19vVjllOU9sTzdzRjhNamd5S3FxY3YyNkZVOW1LblV3MnpUbG94Wjh5QUh4STFIZkpfd2VlSVJYV1luSm53SlU2QlBZQTJnVWxMakp2T2t0dEZJelRFX2x5ZV83cERSRGlxWlE</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心顾问推迟对婴儿乙型肝炎疫苗的计划投票：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5629199/cdc-acip-hepatitis-b-vaccine-meeting</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unexpectedly postponed controversial votes Thursday on changes to the current recommendation of universally immunizing newborns against hepatitis B. Confusion and disagreement over the language of the votes led the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, to push them to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee meeting was marked by unusual conflict and chaos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the third version of the questions that we have received in 72 hours, and we're trying to evaluate a moving target," said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and voting member of the committee. "I protest the description that the ACIP members have been consulted in developing these questions."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The vote was intended to focus on ending a longstanding recommendation to vaccinate all healthy newborns against hepatitis B, regardless of whether the mother tests positive or negative for the virus. But the language of the vote was changed between the time it was posted Friday morning to the early afternoon and some members of the group wanted more time to consider it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current recommendation is intended to make sure no at-risk infant falls through the cracks, and to confer lifelong protection for all U.S. children against the hepatitis B virus, which can cause serious, potentially fatal health problems. It is the cornerstone of a decades-long strategy &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841644" target="_blank"&gt;to eliminate hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B, which is often spread through sexual contact and drug use, can be transmitted from mothers to infants during childbirth, and in infancy through contact with an infected person's body fluids, such as their blood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus attacks the liver and chronic infection can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. The risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants. There's no cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Thursday's discussion, there was a pronounced split between some of the attendees who spoke in favor of changing the recommendation and others who were against a change.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a representative for the Food and Drug Administration, questioned the need for the current universal policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Babies who are born without high risk factors, without a mother who is antigen positive, without a family member who has hepatitis B – for these babies, the potential for benefit is so low," said Høeg, who was named as acting director for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on Thursday. "Why are we stating that it is absolutely necessary to give this dose at birth, when high income nations throughout the world are not?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine, defended the current policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This disease has gone down in the United States, thanks to the effectiveness of our current immunization program," said Meissner, who is the only current member that has served on the committee in the past. When challenged by another adviser, Robert Malone, a vaccinologist and biochemist, to caveat this statement as his "opinion," he replied: "These are facts, Robert."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nonvoting liaisons from medical professional groups spoke out against the process, which deviates from how ACIP usually works.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As physicians, your ethical obligation is to 'first, do no harm' and you are failing in that by promoting this anti-vaccine agenda without the data and evidence necessary to make those informed decisions," said Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison for the American College of Physicians. "Your job as a committee is to look at the totality of the risks and benefits, the harms, the equity, which you have not done."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The postponement leads to a packed agenda on Friday. In addition to the vote to change the hepatitis B policy, the committee is scheduled to discuss how the U.S. vaccine schedule compares to that of other countries, and the links between aluminum – an ingredient used in more than a dozen vaccines to make them more effective – and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most medical professionals say there's no good evidence that aluminum adjuvants are unsafe and ample evidence that they pose no real concern.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts are concerned that this week's moves are part of a concerted effort to undermine vaccine access in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee wields enormous power because its recommendations influence how doctors vaccinate patients and dictate whether insurance companies pay for shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the committee has lost the trust of most mainstream medical groups since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;replaced its members in June&lt;/a&gt; with his own slate. The committee has also abandoned longstanding collaborations with medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and draws less on the experience of CDC experts.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired in June&lt;/a&gt; and replaced with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines — once again delayed an expected &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisers-reverse-newborn-hepatitis-b-vaccine-recommendations-rcna246812" target="_blank"&gt;vote on hepatitis B vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50246d" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of disagreements and confusion over the voting language, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's panel, formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, decided to push the vote to Friday morning instead of holding it Thursday afternoon as scheduled. The committee had previously tabled a September vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fa06d" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting was, in numerous ways, a radical departure from past practices. Typically, the ACIP evaluates new vaccines or new indications for them, not shots that have been administered in the same way for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f8c24" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC has for 34 years recommended that all newborns get a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. But the panel is considering whether to roll back that guidance and instead suggest that women who test negative for hepatitis B decide in consultation with a health care provider whether their baby should get the dose at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a3d2b" class="body-graf"&gt;If adopted, that recommendation would go against widespread consensus among public health experts, who before the meeting issued loud pleas not to change the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9cd393" class="body-graf"&gt;On Thursday, the advisory panel convened in the CDC’s broadcast studio, under bright lights and in front of large television cameras, instead of its typical conference room — giving the appearance of a televised show rather than a scientific discussion. When asked about the venue, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said it was meant to “accommodate increased public interest in the committee.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08f313" class="body-graf"&gt;The proceedings featured a barrage of misleading claims and cherry-picked data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2acbd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Several presenters and panel members claimed there was limited evidence of the hepatitis B vaccine’s safety or efficacy, ignoring decades of evidence to the contrary. At past meetings, the CDC’s medical experts have presented data on the risks of a given disease and the safety and efficacy of vaccines that target it. But the presentations Thursday were instead given by two anti-vaccine activists and a climate scientist who has written for an anti-vaccine publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8cf0bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting was the most blatant example to date of how far the panel has strayed from its original mission to consider who should get vaccines — and when — based on a complete scientific analysis of the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05646b" class="body-graf"&gt;In a presentation on safety, anti-vaccine activist Mark Blaxill — a businessman and author with no medical credentials who was recently hired at the CDC — suggested that symptoms identified in babies who got the hepatitis B vaccine, such as fatigue, weakness, diarrhea or irritability were “possibly connected” to swelling of the brain, or encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbe5af" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, the only ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back: “That is absolutely not encephalitis,” he said. “That’s not a statement that a physician would make. They are not related to encephalitis, and you can’t say that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f59be7" class="body-graf"&gt;By early afternoon, multiple members of the committee expressed confusion over what they were voting on and pointed to issues with the voting language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c58dc3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Perhaps this was written by the department of redundancy department,” quipped ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc9a0b" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel’s chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, was not present for the decision to postpone the hepatitis B vote. Vice chair Dr. Robert Malone said Milhoan was “about to jump on a plane to go to Asia and would not be available, I believe, for [the discussion] tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-b049eb"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1666" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg" alt="US Vaccine Panel Poised To Delay Hepatitis B Shots For Newborns"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Committee member Dr. Robert Malone at Thursday's meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Megan Varner / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-908310" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, commented during the meeting that the proceedings amounted to “political theater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2f98f" class="body-graf"&gt;“You are wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific, rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter,” Goldman said. “The best thing you can do is adjourn the meeting and discuss vaccine issues that actually need to be taken up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad3349" class="body-graf"&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1996564037497491520" target="_blank"&gt;said on X&lt;/a&gt; before the meeting began that the advisory panel is “totally discredited” and “not protecting children.” Cassidy, a liver doctor who treated patients with hepatitis B, chairs the Senate’s health committee and cast a key vote in favor of confirming Kennedy as health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8236c0" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B is an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. So public health experts say that delaying the shots could lead to more infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470a71" class="body-graf"&gt;The prevailing medical consensus is that hepatitis B vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, based on decades of real-world data. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of children born from 1994 to 2023 estimated that hepatitis B vaccination prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-613d59" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to its vote on hepatitis B vaccines Friday, the CDC advisory panel is also expected to discuss the entire childhood immunization schedule, as well as the presence of aluminum salts found in many childhood vaccines, which help boost the immune response and reduce the number of required doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74a245" class="body-graf"&gt;Both are hot-button topics among anti-vaccine activists, who often argue that children receive too many vaccines and that aluminum salts in them increases the risk of autoimmune conditions or neurodevelopmental disorders. Neither claim is supported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8077e" class="body-graf"&gt;Aaron Siri, an anti-vaccine lawyer who has represented Kennedy, is expected to give a presentation Friday. Siri has advocated for the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine.

&lt;p&gt;There’s new progress in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;About 1 in 9 US seniors&lt;/a&gt; has Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, which slowly impairs memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform even basic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no single, easy test to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2842195" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of 18 scientific studies confirms that a simple blood test can detect early signs of the brain disorder before &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/12/health/4-warning-signs-that-may-indicate-early-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;cognitive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alzheimer’s disease gradually destroys memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform even basic tasks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WavebreakMediaMicro – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protein p-tau217 has become a reliable Alzheimer’s biomarker because its concentration in the blood is strongly linked to the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research out this week in JAMA Neurology supports the use of p-tau217 blood tests as a “minimally invasive tool” for early identification of Alzheimer’s, “particularly in settings where timely intervention with disease-modifying therapies may offer the greatest benefit in slowing or preventing disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/liron-sinvani-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Liron Sinvani&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Geriatric Hospitalist Service at Northwell Health and director of research for hospital medicine, called the finding “a major breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just a simple blood test to see if this protein, this p-tau217, is present can indicate that someone is at a very high risk of having dementia right before symptoms even start,” said Sinvani, who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is definitely a big finding in terms of, ‘OK. Can we identify people before they even have symptoms of dementia?'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Blood tests are an up-and-coming method for identifying Alzheimer’s. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dementia symptoms can include memory loss, difficulties with familiar tasks, communication troubles, disorientation, poor judgment and mood or personality changes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An assessment of symptoms is used to diagnose Alzheimer’s, along with a review of health history and physical and neurological exams. Brain imaging and a spinal fluid analysis can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood tests are an up-and-coming method for identifying Alzheimer’s, with the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration recently approving&lt;/a&gt; new blood testing for people 55 and older experiencing symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;P-tau217 blood tests typically require a doctor’s order, though &lt;a href="https://truehealthlabs.com/phosphorylated-tau-217-ptau217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one sells online for $229&lt;/a&gt; with the promise that “no doctor or insurance is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new JAMA review, which included data from over 7,800 people, found that p-tau217 levels were much higher in amyloid-positive people than in amyloid-negative people, even though these individuals had no cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dementia symptoms can include memory loss, difficulties with familiar tasks, communication troubles, disorientation, poor judgment and mood or personality changes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are clumps of misfolded proteins in the brain that can disrupt brain function.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there’s no cure for amyloid plaques in the brain, though there are treatments that can reduce them in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The question in my mind is, at this moment, how many people would want to know that they have this biomarker and have a high risk of dementia?” Sinvani mused.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reason why this isn’t ready for primetime is because we don’t have medications right now that would be offered,” she continued, “but the goal is that if we can identify people early enough, before they even start having symptoms, then we can potentially, hopefully as medications develop, be able to introduce medications that can prevent or slow down the progression.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/28/health/alzheimers-risk-declines-sharply-with-one-daily-lifestyle-change-researchers-say/"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; can lower the risk or potentially slow progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A healthy diet, exercise, increased socialization, making connections and keeping your brain active,” Sinvani said, “these are all things that can impact the trajectory of dementia, and so, knowing that you are at very high risk could be a nice way to sort of incentivize people to start doing something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="7e03b13f-6208-4cc5-92b5-78cd070142cd"&gt;Researchers think they may have found a way to reverse "lazy eye," even in adults who've typically had the condition since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique has so far been tested only in animals, though, so it needs further study before it can be used in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7e03b13f-6208-4cc5-92b5-78cd070142cd-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;A lazy eye, or amblyopia, develops when the brain favors one eye over the other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lazy-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20352391" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lazy-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20352391" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in early childhood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, causing vision in the less-favored &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/what-are-eyes-made-of" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/what-are-eyes-made-of"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eye&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to decline. The standard treatment involves placing a patch over the stronger eye to force the brain to rely on the weaker one. However, this method is effective only during infancy and early childhood, when the neural connections that regulate vision are still being formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2346838d-9866-4817-8d4f-c541c97aa02c"&gt;Now, a mouse study published Nov. 25 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01338-5" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01338-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduces a method for temporarily shutting down the weak eye, which can lead to recovery from amblyopia, even after long-term vision issues. "Rebooting" the lazy eye seems to come from a burst of activity in neurons that pass visual signals from the retina to the visual cortex, a hub for processing visual information in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The finding that inactivation of the amblyopic eye enables vision recovery in a mouse model of amblyopia is encouraging," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/b7thomps" target="_blank" data-url="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/b7thomps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ben Thompson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and the director of the School of Optometry and Vision Science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more research is needed to see whether the method will be safe and effective in humans, too, Thompson told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/" target="_blank" data-url="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Dennis Levi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of optometry and vision science at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study, was also cautiously optimistic about the findings. Historically, scientists have tried various methods of reversing lazy eye in mice, but they "failed to produce significant improvements in humans with amblyopia," he told Live Science in an email. But this new technique seems to hold promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cnKEhdo8WE3US9KxxTNetF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cnKEhdo8WE3US9KxxTNetF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how might temporarily shutting down the weak eye help to restore its vision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70023" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70023" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Earlier work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from MIT neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bearlab.mit.edu/mark-bear/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bearlab.mit.edu/mark-bear/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Bear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues showed that anesthetizing the non-lazy eye triggered visual recovery in the lazy eye in older animals, including cats and mice.

Specifically, these bursts are seen in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), part of the brain that relays information from the eyes to the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar bursts happen in the LGN before birth and help the visual system develop in the womb. That led the team to wonder whether re-creating this early activity pattern could help treat amblyopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tried injecting a local &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anesthetic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the retinas of mice and then monitored the rodents' LGN neurons. TTX is a neurotoxin found in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507714/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507714/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;animals like pufferfish&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it also has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402337/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402337/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;potential therapeutic uses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including anesthesia and the treatment of severe pain. Research into these uses in humans is ongoing, but in the context of this study, TTX was useful for rebooting the retinas of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that shutting down either eye triggered the same burst pattern in the LGN. In a second experiment, they genetically modified the mice so their LGN neurons couldn't produce this burst firing. The activity stopped, and the anesthetic treatment no longer improved amblyopia. That showed that the bursts themselves were crucial for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team tested whether they could treat amblyopia by inactivating only the weak eye. They ran an experiment in which some mice with amblyopia got an injection in their weak eye while others did not. The injection stopped the retina from sending signals for about two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="814b5813-4ed3-486e-b8a4-a9895cb72e39"&gt;A week after the injection, the scientists measured how much each eye influenced activity in the visual cortex and found that the treated mice had a much more balanced input from both eyes than the untreated mice did. This showed that shutting down the weak eye for a short time helped it "catch up" with the other eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said this result is encouraging "because the fellow eye does not have to be exposed to any risks of the treatment." But he emphasized that "more work is needed to assess whether tetrodotoxin will be safe and effective in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that the effects of TTX on amblyopia generalize to cats and monkeys, raising hope that the approach may one day help humans as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that burst firing can help boost the brain's ability to rewire and form new networks is "extremely interesting," Thompson said. Noninvasive tools used to stimulate the brain might eventually be harnessed to trigger similar neural responses, without the need for TTX injections, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="049c6ea2-bde5-4d76-a0fd-05dd95744052"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick and easy breath test to detect the difficult-to-diagnose pancreatic cancer is being trialed nationally in the UK with huge expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate among cancers because of the tendency to discover it at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been a breath test authorized by a major regulatory body like the British NIH or US Food and Drug Administration, but the initiative has far bigger aspirations than simply setting milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of pancreatic cancer across the UK found that over 60% of cases are detected at stage 4. At this point, there’s not much to be done, and indeed, the same analysis found only 22% of patients diagnosed at this stage survive even a month beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to diagnose in part because it manifests in vague symptoms like backpain and indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial College London and Pancreatic Cancer UK are teaming up to launch a major trial of a new breath testing device in 40 different locations across the Scotland, Wales, and England, with a target for 6,000 patients. The breath test will detect volatile organic compounds, or VOCs that are linked with pancreatic cancer; even in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of these VOCs travel around the bloodstream and can be expelled in a single breath. An analysis of the entire collection can pinpoint to cancer from other potential infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCER TESTING IMPROVEMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The breath test has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer. It is, undoubtedly, the most significant step toward a lifesaving breakthrough in 50 years,” &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/pancreatic-cancer-breath-test-nhs-b2854162.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Diana Jupp, chief executive of Pancreatic Cancer UK which is funding the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While more years of development are still needed before we can put this exciting new technology into the hands of GPs across the country, thousands of patients with an unknown diagnosis will now help refine it in the real-world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first pancreatic cancer breath test to ever reach a national clinical trial of this scale. That in itself makes this a moment of real, tangible hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that children who are highly sensitive to everyday stimuli may unknowingly regulate their neural networks to cope with overwhelming sights and sounds. The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s11689-025-09656-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing challenges are a frequent concern for parents and clinicians. These issues often manifest as sensory over-responsivity. Children with this condition experience intense physical or emotional reactions to stimuli that others might find harmless or mundane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common triggers include the texture of clothing seams, the sound of a vacuum cleaner, or bright fluorescent lights. While these reactions are often observed in children with autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, they also occur in children without a specific diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biological mechanisms behind these intense reactions have remained largely elusive. Diagnosis currently relies on caregiver reports and clinical observations rather than biological markers. To address this gap, a team of researchers sought to map the neural underpinnings of sensory over-responsivity. They aimed to understand how different brain systems interact when a child processes sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by a multidisciplinary team. The lead investigators included Pratik Mukherjee, a professor of radiology and biomedical imaging, and Elysa Marco, a pediatric neurologist. Both are affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco. They collaborated with researchers from Cortica Healthcare and other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators based their analysis on a framework of two opposing brain systems. They categorized these as exogenous and endogenous systems. The exogenous system involves brain networks that face outward. It includes regions responsible for processing vision, touch, and movement. This system helps the brain interpret raw data coming from the external environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the endogenous system focuses inward. It includes networks responsible for attention, decision-making, and emotional regulation. This system handles higher-level cognitive tasks. It allows an individual to plan actions, control impulses, and attribute meaning to experiences. The researchers hypothesized that the balance between these two systems might look different in children who struggle with sensory regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, the team recruited 83 children between the ages of 8 and 12. All participants were recruited from a community neurodevelopment center. They screened the children to ensure they were neurodiverse, meaning they had a high likelihood of a developmental condition such as ADHD or learning differences. However, the researchers specifically excluded children with a confirmed autism diagnosis to reduce variability in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians assessed the children using a structured evaluation called the Sensory Processing 3 Dimensions Assessment. Based on this direct observation, the children were divided into two groups. One group consisted of 39 children who exhibited sensory over-responsivity. The second group consisted of 44 neurodiverse children who did not show these specific sensory sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brains of all participants. They employed a technique known as resting-state functional MRI. This method measures spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity while the subject is at rest. It allows scientists to see which brain regions are communicating with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging results revealed a striking divergence between the two groups. In the children with sensory over-responsivity, the researchers observed a reduction in connectivity within the exogenous networks. Specifically, the areas of the brain dedicated to vision and motor control showed lower levels of local synchronization. It appeared as though the brain was dampening its connection to the sensory world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, these same children showed elevated connectivity within the endogenous networks. The brain regions associated with attention and cognitive control were highly active and synchronized. This pattern created a distinct neural signature. The inward-facing systems were dialed up, while the outward-facing systems were dialed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurodiverse children without sensory issues displayed the exact opposite pattern. In this group, the exogenous sensory networks were highly connected. Conversely, their endogenous regulation networks showed lower levels of connectivity. This created a clear “double dissociation” between the two groups. The functional organization of their brains appeared to be diametrically opposed depending on their sensory responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contrast was evident in both long-range and local brain connections. Long-range connectivity refers to communication between distant brain regions. Local connectivity refers to synchronization among neighboring neurons. The study found that children with sensory over-responsivity had generally weaker long-range connections across the brain. However, the local hyper-connectivity in their regulatory networks was a standout feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined the structural integrity of the brain’s white matter. White matter acts as the cabling that connects different brain regions. Using diffusion tensor imaging, the team found that children with sensory sensitivities had reduced structural integrity in specific pathways. These pathways included the posterior thalamic radiations, which carry visual information, and the internal capsule, which carries touch and motor signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the practical implications of these brain patterns, the researchers looked at behavioral data. They assessed how well the children managed their emotions in daily life. They classified the children as either “resilient” or “dysregulated” based on parent reports. Resilient children were better at adapting to change and recovering from setbacks. Dysregulated children struggled more with anger and emotional control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the distinct brain pattern—low sensory connectivity and high regulatory connectivity—was strongest in the resilient children with sensory over-responsivity. This suggests that the brain pattern may be an adaptive mechanism. A child who is easily overwhelmed by sensory input might subconsciously suppress their sensory networks to reduce the noise. At the same time, they may upregulate their cognitive control networks to maintain composure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the dysregulated children, this distinct separation of brain systems was less apparent. Their brain activity did not show the same clear compensatory shift. This implies that the ability to modulate these two systems is linked to better emotional and behavioral outcomes. The unique neural signature identified by the researchers seems to be a marker of successful coping in the face of sensory overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pratik Mukherjee noted the logic behind this physiological response. He explained, “We think that when you are overstimulated by sensory input, you compensate by dialing up your brain’s inward-focused networks to gain self-control. You also dial down your outward-focused networks to minimize sensory input.” He added that children who are not overwhelmed do not need to employ this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also tested whether these brain patterns could be used for diagnosis. They utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze the imaging data. By combining functional MRI data with structural white matter data, the algorithms could classify children with high accuracy. The model distinguished between children with and without sensory over-responsivity with nearly 90 percent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high level of classification suggests that sensory over-responsivity has a robust biological basis. It is not merely a behavioral preference or a symptom of other conditions. It involves measurable changes in how the brain is wired and how it functions. The ability to identify these markers could eventually lead to objective diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats to consider regarding this research. The sample size of 83 children is relatively small for a neuroimaging study. The findings will need to be replicated in larger, independent cohorts to ensure they are distinct and universal. Additionally, the study excluded children with autism. Since sensory issues are highly prevalent in autism, it remains unknown if these specific findings apply to that population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-sectional nature of the study also limits conclusions about cause and effect. The researchers looked at the children at a single point in time. It is not yet clear when these brain patterns emerge in development. Longitudinal studies following children from infancy through adolescence would be necessary to track how these networks develop. Such studies could determine if the brain patterns precede the sensory issues or develop as a response to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research directions include investigating how these brain networks respond to treatment. Occupational therapy is a common intervention for sensory processing challenges. Researchers could use these imaging techniques to see if therapy changes brain connectivity. If the brain pattern is indeed a coping mechanism, successful therapy might alter the need for such strong downregulation of sensory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s11689-025-09656-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A neural substrate for sensory over-responsivity defined by exogenous and endogenous brain systems&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hannah L.

She talks about this all year long so that was really odd,” Kammer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Then came troubling text messages from Gibneski — strings of words that didn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I was texting Chris and Rich — charged, school, changed, closed, you are?

And I came out to my balcony ‘I said I’m fine I just need some more sleep,’” Gibneski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Airing on the side of caution, Kammer called for backup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Should I just kick the door down, it’s weird but you just wonder, like is someone alright in there...and I decided to call 9-1-1,” Kammer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Paramedics arrived moments later and eventually convinced Gibneski to step outside and let them help her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I didn’t even know my birthday when they asked me,” Gibneski shared. “I ended up in the ambulance and was taken straight to UW.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Gibneski spent nearly a week in the hospital as doctors searched for the cause of her sudden decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“She had a stroke workup done. They imaged her brain. We were trying to figure out if there were any medications causing it,” said Claire Strangstalien, a UW Health hospitalist physician assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Strangstalien explained the possibility of a rare diagnosis — Mollaret’s meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“A rare neurologic disease in which you have periods of symptom free living normally and then recurrent episodes of meningitis typically caused by a virus,” Strangstalien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;This episode marked the third time in Gibneski’s life she had battled meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I really believe someone was looking out after me...because I am one lucky person. It feels weird that I might not have been here,” Gibneski choked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Weeks later, the three friends, Madison West graduates, found their way back to simple routines and the place that brought them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Weeks after Annie was discharged from the hospital the three friends went back to the lights for the final tweaks of the season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(Chris Kammer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“She’s been spreading love and care, sharing her heart her whole life. Beyond anybody I know. She’s kind of almost that unicorn angel that is so amazing. So if Rich and I got a chance to be apart of the miracle that she deserved we couldn’t be happier,” Kammer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I’m going to celebrate being alive,” Gibneski said. “And I got a lot more living to do on this planet. So I guess they weren’t ready for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;If you’d like to make a donation to keep the lights on for the &lt;a href="https://universityavenueholidaylights.com/donate-2" target="_self" rel="" title="https://universityavenueholidaylights.com/donate-2"&gt;annual tradition, see here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU" data-fusion-component="TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU" data-fusion-component="TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;Understanding meningitis - signs, treatment and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Types and treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“So there’s two types of meningitis. There’s infectious and non-infectious. And infectious causes are more common, most common being viral. But there also can be bacterial meningitis, which can be fatal if left untreated,” said Claire Strangstalien, a UW Health physician assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s a very serious condition that requires antibiotics. In her [Gibneski] case, if she did have something like bacterial meningitis that we were empirically treating for, meaning we just put her on antibiotics when she came in, she could have died from that. But we did determine it was from a virus, fortunately,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Strangstalien said viral meningitis is typically self-limited, meaning it can get better without specific treatment with supportive care. In Gibneski’s case, doctors had an antiviral available to help treat the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“So if she, you know, if she did have a more serious form of the meningitis going on, which she certainly could have, and we didn’t know at that time when she was altered, that could have certainly been fatal. But fortunately, we were able to determine it was from a virus. And kind of that helped us lead into her diagnosis of probable Mollaret meningitis that our infectious disease team picked up on,” Strangstalien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning signs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Signs to look out for is this classic triad of headache, neck stiffness and fevers,” Strangstalien said. “Other common symptoms we see are sensitivity to light or noise, nausea, vomiting, confusion, or having an altered mental status, such as in this case. Less frequently, we can also see seizures or coma, but that’s much less frequent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prevention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Strangstalien emphasized the importance of vaccination as a prevention tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We do have vaccines that help prevent different types of meningitis. And there’s no one vaccine that can prevent meningitis because it’s caused by so many different things. But we do have multiple vaccines that protect against bacterial meningitis, which is a very serious form of meningitis and can be fatal if left untreated,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;She also recommended basic precautions such as hand hygiene and staying home when sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;Meningitis Cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County update their &lt;a href="https://publichealthmdc.com/for-providers/reportable-disease-data" target="_self" rel="" title="https://publichealthmdc.com/for-providers/reportable-disease-data"&gt;Reportable Disease Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to track current cases of meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;WMTV also reached out to University Health Services for a look at what cases on the UW Madison campus have reflected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;University Health Services Director of Medical Services, Andrew O’Donnell has shared the following information: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote | article-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;Please note that viral meningitis is distinct from and less serious than &lt;a href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=691cee432b1f656ff10dd75c&amp;amp;Domain=gray.tv&amp;amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;Lang=en&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNpFyUsOgCAMBNAT2dl7m1IJNOFjZLTXd8nbvkre6wQiQuwyKfNDz8NHcfqCpvkSSY35cW3HLqns7QfiJhfQ&amp;amp;@OriginalLink=www.cdc.gov" rel="" title="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=691cee432b1f656ff10dd75c&amp;amp;Domain=gray.tv&amp;amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;Lang=en&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNpFyUsOgCAMBNAT2dl7m1IJNOFjZLTXd8nbvkre6wQiQuwyKfNDz8NHcfqCpvkSSY35cW3HLqns7QfiJhfQ&amp;amp;@OriginalLink=www.cdc.gov"&gt;bacterial meningitis.&lt;/a&gt; Viral meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is usually milder than bacterial meningitis. Most people recover fully with rest and supportive care at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Between October 24 and November 10&lt;/b&gt;, nine students were diagnosed with viral meningitis. All students received prompt medical care and are recovering at home. In late October, University Health Services shared a message with campus to increase awareness of symptoms and preventive measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;We encourage anyone with meningitis symptoms—including a severe headache, rash, light sensitivity, confusion, or stiff neck—to see a healthcare provider right away, since viral and bacterial meningitis can present similarly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbc15.com/page/find-nbc15-news-wherever-you-are/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WMTV.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Notification of Rabies Case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 27, 2025, CDC was notified of possible rabies virus infection in a kidney transplant recipient (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). After CDC confirmed diagnosis, jurisdictional health departments and CDC conducted an investigation to determine the source of the infection and to identify other persons at risk. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Kidney Recipient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, an adult male Michigan resident received a left kidney transplant from an Idaho donor at an Ohio hospital. Approximately 5 weeks later, the recipient experienced tremors, lower extremity weakness, confusion, and urinary incontinence. Seven days after symptom onset, he was hospitalized with fever, hydrophobia, dysphagia, and autonomic instability. On hospital day 2, he required invasive mechanical ventilation. On hospital day 4, clinicians consulted the Ohio Department of Health and CDC because the recipient’s signs and symptoms were compatible with rabies. The Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire reported that the donor had received a skunk scratch. The kidney recipient’s saliva, nuchal skin biopsy, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, collected on hospital days 3–6, were sent to CDC for rabies testing. On hospital day 7, the recipient died; postmortem brain tissue samples were sent to CDC. Rabies virus RNA was detected in saliva, nuchal skin, and brain tissue samples. Rabies virus immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum. Viral characterization was consistent with the silver-haired bat (&lt;i&gt;Lasionycteris noctivagans&lt;/i&gt;) rabies virus variant. Michigan public health officials interviewed the kidney recipient’s family; no animal exposures were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Idaho Organ Donor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rabies was suspected, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, the local public health district, and CDC investigated the Idaho donor as the possible infection source. Interviews with the family added details not included in the DRAI questionnaire. In late October 2024, a skunk approached the donor as he held a kitten in an outbuilding on his rural property. During an encounter that rendered the skunk unconscious, the donor sustained a shin scratch that bled, but he did not think he had been bitten. According to the family, the donor attributed the skunk’s behavior to predatory aggression toward the kitten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the donor’s household reported that approximately 5 weeks later, in early December, the donor was confused, had difficulty swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations, and had a stiff neck. Two days after symptom onset, he was found unresponsive at home after presumed cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and hospitalized but never regained consciousness. He was declared brain dead and removed from life support on hospital day 5. Left kidney, heart, lungs, and both corneas were recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, stored serum that had been collected from the donor on his third hospital day was tested and determined to be negative for rabies virus antibody. A multiweek laboratory traceback investigation identified right and left kidney biopsy samples. CDC detected rabies virus RNA consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies virus variant in a biopsy sample of the right kidney, suggesting organ-derived transmission. The left kidney biopsy sample had insufficient tissue for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Donor Corneal Tissues and Tissue Recipients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four ocular grafts were prepared from recovered corneas. Three patients, one each from California, Idaho, and New Mexico, received grafts in December 2024 and January 2025. While investigation of the donor’s rabies status was ongoing, the cornea recipients underwent precautionary graft removal and received PEP. They remained asymptomatic. A planned transplantation of the fourth corneal graft to a Missouri patient was cancelled. CDC detected rabies virus RNA consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies virus variant in one previously implanted corneal graft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Donor Heart and Lungs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart and lungs of the donor were not transplanted but were used in training procedures at a Maryland medical research facility. By the time of the public health investigation, no specimens were available for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

People in highly supportive marriages showed better control of food cravings, healthier gut metabolism, and higher levels of oxytocin, a hormone linked to bonding and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biological changes were not seen in unmarried individuals or in marriages with low emotional support. The findings suggest that relationship quality may be a powerful, overlooked factor in long-term weight regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Supportive marriages were linked to stronger activity in brain regions that regulate cravings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut Metabolism:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional support was associated with healthier tryptophan-related gut metabolites tied to serotonin and energy balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher oxytocin levels appeared to coordinate both appetite control and gut metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong social relationships, particularly high-quality marriages, may help protect against obesity by influencing a complex communication system between the brain and gut, according to new research by UCLA Health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;, is the first to demonstrate how social bonds influence weight and eating behaviors through an integrated pathway involving brain function, metabolism and the hormone oxytocin, sometimes referred to as “the love hormone.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-114228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a couple cooking together." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/12/marriage-microbiome-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“Think of oxytocin as a conductor orchestrating a symphony between the brain and gut,” said Church. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the quality of relationships may be just as important to physical health as traditional risk factors like exercise and diet &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for years that social relationships impact health, with supportive connections increasing survival rates by up to 50%,” said lead author Dr. Arpana Church, a neuroscientist at UCLA Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biological mechanisms explaining this connection have remained elusive. Our study reveals a novel pathway showing how marriage and emotional support literally get ‘under the skin’ to influence obesity risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 100 participants from the Los Angeles area participated in the study. The participants provided data including marital status, current Body Mass Index (BMI), race, age, sex, diet style and quality and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also conducted various tests on the participants including brain imaging while food images were displayed; fecal samples to test for metabolites; blood plasma tests to measure oxytocin levels; and clinical and behavioral evaluations including assessment of their perceived emotional support system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Church lab found that married individuals with higher perceived emotional support had a lower body mass index and exhibited fewer food addiction behaviors compared to married participants with low emotional support. Brain imaging showed these individuals had enhanced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which manages cravings and appetite, when viewing food images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, unmarried people with and without strong emotional support did not show the same brain patterns, potentially due to more diverse and less consistent social support networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social support also had significant changes in gut metabolism. Those with stronger support showed beneficial changes in tryptophan metabolites, which are compounds produced by gut bacteria that regulate inflammation, immune function, energy balance and brain health. These metabolites are also involved in producing serotonin and other compounds that can influence mood, social behavior and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to these findings is the hormone oxytocin. Married participants with strong emotional support showed higher levels of oxytocin levels compared to unmarried individuals. Church said their findings suggest oxytocin may act as a biological messenger that simultaneously enhances brain regions involved in self-control while promoting healthier gut metabolic profiles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of oxytocin as a conductor orchestrating a symphony between the brain and gut,” said Church. “It strengthens the brain’s ability to resist food cravings while promoting beneficial metabolic processes in the gut, both of which help maintain healthy weight.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also challenges oversimplified views about marriage and weight. The benefits relating to self-control, metabolism and oxytocin levels were more pronounced among married participants who endorsed greater emotional support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Marriage may serve as a training ground for self-control,” said Church. “Maintaining a long-term partnership requires consistently overriding destructive impulses and aligning with long-term goals, which may strengthen the same brain circuits involved in managing eating behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church said the study opens potential avenues for obesity prevention and treatment by incorporating the need to build strong social relationships alongside a healthy diet and exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results underscore the critical importance of building long-lasting, positive, and stable relationships to promote overall health,” Church said. “Social connections aren’t just emotionally fulfilling; they’re biologically embedded in our health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted several limitations. The study captured data at a single point in time and cannot definitively establish cause-and-effect relationships, Church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most participants were overweight or obese, and married participants tended to be older. Future research with larger, more diverse samples and longitudinal designs is needed to confirm these findings and better understand the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764871550409"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Stay strong and independent after 50 with five daily moves that build everyday strength.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Building strength is king when it comes to healthy aging. Not only does a strong, toned physique look and feel great in every stage of life, but it’s also essential as you age in order to maintain your independence. You need strong muscles in order to climb stairs, carry groceries, and get in and out of chairs and your bed. To help make your workout time as productive as possible, we learned five daily exercises that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/jennifer-anistons-trainer-shares-5-moves-that-build-real-world-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;build more real-world strength&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-daily-exercises-that-build-more-strength-than-gym-workouts-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;gym workouts&lt;/a&gt; after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From a functional training perspective, ‘&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/jennifer-anistons-trainer-shares-5-moves-that-build-real-world-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;real-world strength&lt;/a&gt;‘ means having the strength, mobility, and coordination to perform everyday activities efficiently and with less risk of injury,” &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://thwarrior.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eric North&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, aka The Happiness Warrior—a wellness speaker, coach, and advocate redefining what it means to age with purpose, strength, and emotional vitality, says. “It focuses on movements that mimic real life, like lifting, pulling, and pushing, rather than isolated exercises, to build a body that is strong and resilient for any task. Functional training helps to slow or even reduce the natural progression of aging and impacts our functional age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those 50+ looking to build real-world strength, North recommends emphasizing compound, multi-joint movements that mimic daily activities like pushing, pulling, carrying, sitting down, and standing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These exercises are highly efficient and promote better mobility, balance, and overall independence,” North says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="squat-or-chair-sit" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squat or Chair Sit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l83R5PblSMA?si=YwbDZIgYWrRFqJhy" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This movement is fundamental to daily life, mirroring the action of standing up from a chair or toilet, walking up stairs, and getting on/off the floor,” North tells us. “It builds strength in the legs, glutes, and core, improving balance and flexibility to help prevent falls. Note that the inability to stand up from the toilet is one of the primary factors that leads to assisted living.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To perform squats, stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms in front of you or place your hands on your hips. Use a chair for support, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to descend until your thighs assume a “sitting” position or lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="pushups-or-modified-pushups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pushups or Modified Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWxvty2KROs?si=Om6sI3PQBxmMsrNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A primary upper-body pushing movement, pushups strengthen the chest, shoulders, and triceps, which are vital for tasks like pushing open heavy doors, pushing a shopping cart, or lifting ourselves up after a fall,” North points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin on all fours on a mat, placing your hands just outside shoulder-width.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest your knees on the ground so your body is straight from head to knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core and keep your back flat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 2 to 3 sets with 10 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="dumbbell-or-banded-rows" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dumbbell or Banded Rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JP2xq33lNF0?si=oXGZhp0CMRzOpFX0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a crucial pulling exercise that counteracts the forward-leaning posture common with age, stooping, and desk work,” North tells us. “It strengthens the back and bicep muscles used for everyday activities like opening doors, vacuuming, and pulling items toward you. It helps us to maintain better posture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor a resistance band to a sturdy pole at chest level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, facing the anchor point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab onto the band with both hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and pull the band toward your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="plank" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ao5nY7lb088?si=AszlJvWN69JYcQ01" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong core is essential for balance, stability, and supporting your back during virtually all movements. Planks help build core strength and improve posture without requiring potentially stressful bending movements,” North explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a forearm plank with your forearms on the floor—elbows under your shoulders—and your body forming a straight line from your head to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternately, assume a high plank with your hands under your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid letting your hips sag or rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the position for 30 seconds as you engage your legs, glutes, and core. Work your way up to a 2-minute plank hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="farmers-carry" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Farmer’s Carry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OtwXwrJizk?si=5WOfljRXWhnHUMBp" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This simple yet highly functional exercise builds grip strength, core stability, and full-body endurance. It directly translates to real-world tasks like carrying groceries, luggage, pets, or grandchildren,” North tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a heavy dumbbell or kettlebell—50% of your body weight—in each hand at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start walking forward, keeping your torso still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion? “After age 50, our strength needs to shift from focusing solely on maximal strength to prioritizing functional capacity to counteract significant declines in muscle mass (sarcopenia), force production speed, balance, and mobility. The goal becomes maintaining the physical abilities necessary for independent daily living and fall prevention,” North says. And these exercises will help you do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only have so many comments before idiotic rate limiting. But I'll comment here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for dis-ease or dis-ability, it doesnt interfere with ease of life. Nor does it materially affect my ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I would add several sensory issues (for me it's noises, multiple conversations at the same time, stickiness, physical contact, whole categories of food and several others) and several social issues to your list of superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And too true. I have some as you listed as well. However, I also figured out what causes them in me, and how to reduce their effects to nil. In a way, its self-treatment with n=1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noise: I dont have a problem with noise per se. However, when multiple people are talking or music with lyrics are on in the background, its incredibly hard for me to process what's spoken along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly though, when I was principal clarinettist in a symphony, I could easily pick out any instrument by simple concentration. All I know is the noise issue with me is something with vocal processing of over-talking voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;stickiness: for me, its dirt on my hands. Or chicken/turkey/beef/pork/lamb/goat blood. I do a lot of cooking. I hate those feelings on my skin. But I find that as long as I wash my hands before and after with a good degreasing soap (Dawn), the icky goes away. I can still do the task at speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont have the physical contact issues for people I'm close with. So, thats not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food: theres only a few foods I can't eat, due to vomiting reasons. Tapioca based products are the big one. Aside from that, I eat everything from blue cheese, to cow tongue, offal from beef and birds,ghost peppers, pork brains, hakarl. I like the tastes and sensations that foods have. In a way, I'm wondering if this is also relayed to the supersensitive reject-foods type. Definitely not a disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, theres the huge downsides with interpersonal interactions. Took me decades to really piece together and emulate  and identify emotional state in others. But the psychologists dont know how to fix this either. Most of them are NTs who it comes naturally. But they want their indefinite sessions to do basically nothing but pay $200/hr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Seeing it purely as a positive is insultingly reductive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there are up and downsides to NT's and ND's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotypicals are more known for deception and lying. Or they use the term "little white lies". These things slowly stack up in NT conversations until they become huge problems. Sitcoms are based on this. But ND's, well, we are the weird ones. When someone asks "do I look good in this?" And you say "no, it clashes with your skin tone" - you were supposed to know they wanted a yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel sad that NTs can't properly hyperfocus, and can easily drop out of hyperfocus with low sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NTs memory is foggy and badly reorders things. Or they misremember and blame others for ill-perceived issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are good and bad. I'm glad I'm ND, likely Aspergers (hence autistic).

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In the 1990s we drugged kids (especially young boys) who weren't able to sit still with ADHD medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This never happened. We did not overprescribe Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What actually happened, is uninformed people like you with no actual evidence spread FUD about how giving kids well understood medicine was "bad" and the direct result of that was people like me, my sister, and my brother who all had stereotypical ADHD symptoms that we inherited from our stereotypically ADHD parents were tested and &lt;i&gt;rejected&lt;/i&gt; an ADHD diagnosis by untrained school guidance counselors terrified of something that &lt;i&gt;wasn't happening&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of us spent the next 30 years utterly failing to thrive due to struggling with these symptoms, and experienced immense suffering from normal life things. We all have finally gotten real diagnosis, and some of us are getting real treatment, and we are so much better off now and able to function, and we are even able to pass those learnings back up the chain to our parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge part of the "ADHD Epidemic" right now is the fact that a couple million people with clear ADHD symptoms were &lt;i&gt;passed over&lt;/i&gt; by people who were supposed to be helping them due to the exact FUD you are spreading now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;This generation it's autism, and it's likely over-diagnosed just as much as ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is not overdiagnosed. Autism is not overdiagnosed. Provide any evidence &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt; to support your shit claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone with just a whiff of autism struggle gets diagnosed as autism, that's fine, and they will be explained how they might not even need significant support, and they don't really get any treatment at all. For people with gentle autism like that, it's mostly just about understanding &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; you are the way you are. "Oh, that's why I &amp;lt;X&amp;gt;". And you suddenly have a framework and vocabulary to better explain the struggles you have and the problems you experience, and a way to bond with people who have similar difficulties, and a way to think about your own brain that can help you lessen the negative impact of being different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It comes as no surprise that psychiatry, and medicine in general, is suffering from a massive reproducibility crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is ZERO reproducibility crisis in ADHD science, and amphetamine based ADHD medications are some of the most well supported, scientifically, medicine we have &lt;i&gt;full stop&lt;/i&gt;. You can literally measure &lt;i&gt;physiological&lt;/i&gt; brain differences of people with ADHD, and if you give a kid with ADHD a stimulant medication for their life, &lt;i&gt;those measurable differences go away&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you give ADHD people stimulants, &lt;i&gt;all cause mortality decreases&lt;/i&gt;. They become statistically better drivers, which is something that ADHD people are statistically worse than average at. You lower all forms of addiction and substance abuse, because ADHD people struggle with self medicating and abusing substances as a rule. Notably, all the good Ritalin does for people who struggle with ADHD is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; duplicated in people who do not have ADHD. People who take unprescribed Ritalin as a "study drug" have worse outcomes than people who take it for actual ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving kids with ADHD stimulants &lt;i&gt;reduces bone fractures and STDs!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;You either have some quantity of illness or you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is stupid. Some people with bad eyesight need glasses to do normal day to day things while others don't, or only need glasses for reading, but &lt;i&gt;both are diagnosed nearsighted&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Much to the disservice of people suffering from the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop talking for me, you are doing an atrocious job of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It's not anti-science to call into question the amount of bunk, p-hacked, corporate funded garbage coming out of even the highest tier of medical grade journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; antiscience to demonstrably have no clue what you are talking about and yet claim the experts are wrong. That is literally antiscience. There's no p-hacking in ADHD science. There's no corporate funded garbage for ADHD. Ritalin is old and cheap and no longer patent protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;If anything, your own post demonstrates the anti-scientific (pop-sci) instagramification of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How dare you thumb your nose at kids self diagnosing on tiktok (not instagram, pay attention) as "pop-sci" when you yourself know only reactionary FUD. Shame on you. Educate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="athing comtr" id="46151202"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="ind" indent="3"&gt;&lt;img src="s.gif"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" class="votelinks"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a id="up_46151202" href="vote?id=46151202&amp;amp;how=up&amp;amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46149375"&gt;&lt;p class="votearrow" title="upvote"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="default"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania heart specialists welcomed the results of a decade-long study reinforcing their belief in minimally invasive techniques to treat clogged neck arteries versus major surgery.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined nearly 2,500 patients across five countries and 155 medical centers, including several UPMC hospitals and the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients hadn’t experienced a stroke but were at risk of one because of severe blockages of a carotid artery, large vessels on each side of the neck shuttling blood from the heart to the brain.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 400,000 people are diagnosed with carotid artery disease each year in the U.S., and the condition causes 1 in 3 strokes, according to data cited by Allegheny Health Network.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the patients got either medical therapy — a combination of drugs and lifestyle management — or medical therapy plus a plaque removal surgery known as an endarterectomy. The procedure appeared to do little to lower the risk of stroke or death over a four-year period compared to medical therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other half received medical therapy and a stent, a small device to prop open the artery, or just medical therapy. The stented patients were half as likely to have a stroke or die over the four years versus those just taking the drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, eagerly awaited by cardiologists and vascular surgeons worldwide, were published last month in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2508800" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main takeaways varied among local medical professionals, who say they remain confident in their current practices.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Dr. Amish Mehta, a cardiologist at AHN’s Jefferson Hospital, the study confirmed his sense that modern medications do a great job preventing strokes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are able to reduce clotting, lower blood pressure and limit cholesterol levels using various drugs. Most of these weren’t available in the 1990s, when researchers last compared medical therapy and surgery in such a rigorous way.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management of diet and exercise as well as smoking cessation techniques have also improved over the years, Mehta noted, further bolstering the medical therapy route.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stent still performed better in the trial, resulting in a stroke or death rate just under 3% versus 6% with medication and lifestyle changes. But the gap “doesn’t translate into a major difference in how patients do,” Mehta said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Simone, a vascular surgeon at St. Clair Hospital, agreed, adding that patient preferences should be considered alongside the data.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some patients might be scared of surgery,” Simone said. “Other people are like, I can’t live like this. I have a bomb in my neck.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Measuring stroke rates&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Bachinsky, a UPMC interventional cardiologist based in Central Pennsylvania, said it’s hard to ignore the case for stenting in asymptomatic but severe carotid artery disease cases.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure, which uses a small incision in the groin to thread the stent into the carotid artery, does carry some risks up front. In the study, the stent group saw seven strokes and one death in the 44 days post-operation. All medical therapy patients, in contrast, were fine.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But stroke rates were much higher in the latter group after that. The cumulative benefits over the four-year period are worth it for many people, in the view of Bachinsky.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s performed the procedure as part of clinical trials more than 1,500 times since 2000, and was the principal investigator for the stenting trial at UPMC’s Harrisburg and West Shore hospitals.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen time and time again is that if patients are selected properly, they’re done by experienced operators…. carotid artery stenting has similar if not better outcomes than an endarterectomy, mainly because it’s less invasive,” he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endarterectomies involve an incision into the carotid artery, which allows the surgeon to pull out the plaque. The procedure is typically done under general anesthesia. Most people go home within a day or two.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results have no bearing on the surgery’s efficacy in treating patients who’ve had a stroke.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hybrid procedure where surgeons place a stent using a more direct route emerged over the course of the study and therefore was not included.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newer operation has promise in terms of reducing stroke or death during or shortly after surgery, according to Dr. Elizabeth Detschelt, a vascular surgeon at Independence Health System.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carotid artery disease is brought on by the accumulation of plaque, a sticky mix of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances that stiffen arterial walls and eventually limits blood flow, according to Cleveland Clinic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know they have a serious buildup of plaque until they have a heart attack, stroke or major issue with their cardiovascular system, Cleveland Clinic notes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, doctors may be able to detect it using a stethoscope by listening for a bruit, a distinctive swooshing sound caused by narrowing of the carotid artery. Mehta said the disease is also sometimes caught during unrelated head and neck imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age, high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, use of tobacco products, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of exercise, poor diet and a family history of early heart disease.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of ways to implement mosquito control, but none have proved a cure-all against the deadliest animal on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have genetically-engineered a natural enemy of the mosquito—with millions of years of evolution backing up its deadly design—to attract and kill the insects even when humans were also on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called Metarhizium, and it’s a parasitic fungus that lures insects to their death with an odorous compound called longifolene. The fungus plays the olfactory role of a nectar-rich flower, attracting bugs like mosquitoes before infecting them with its spores that kill and eat the creature from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the fungus only creates longifolene after it kills a bug, which means a lot of waiting around to start; not a positive for a potential mosquito-control agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02155-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last week in Nature Microbiology, mycologist Raymond St. Leger at the Department of Entomology at the University of Maryland and his co-authors from China and Burkina Faso elaborated how they were able to genetically engineer Metarhizium to produce longifolene in huge amounts around the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fungus is completely harmless to humans as longifolene is already commonly used in perfumes and has a long safety record,” Dr. St. Leger explained to his university press. “This makes it much safer than many chemical pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When grown on simple wheat or rice substrate in a patent-pending trap design that admits only mosquitoes and not beneficial insects, it successfully culled about half of all mosquitoes released into a room that included a human volunteer sleeping under a bug net over a period of 5 days, and nearly all followed a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. St. Leger doesn’t believe his traps are a solution on their own, and his collaborators in China are experimenting with other methods of mosquito control to see if there’s an ideal complement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOSQUITO BITES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fungus is easily produced in a variety of settings, including in rural communities where it can be grown on common feedstock like rice. Unlike synthetic chemicals that coat mosquito nets, some of which the insects are now resistant to, Metarhizium has millions of years of evolution behind it, meaning it’s unlikely the bugs will be able to withstand these traps anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If mosquitoes evolve to avoid longifolene, that could mean they’ll stop responding to flowers,” St. Leger said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But they need flowers as a food source to survive, so it would be very interesting to see how they could possibly avoid the fungus yet still be attracted to the flowers they need. It’ll be very difficult for them to overcome that hurdle, and we have the option of engineering the fungus to produce additional floral odors if they evolve to specifically avoid longifolene.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The US health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, believes that aluminium in vaccines can cause health issues, such as neurological disorders, allergies and autoimmune diseases. This contradicts scientific evidence from many studies that have confirmed the safety of vaccines and aluminium “adjuvants” – substances that boost vaccines’ effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2025, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/rfk-jr-139505"&gt;RFK Jr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/21/rfk-jr-ordered-vaccines-autism-cdc-website-change/"&gt;“personally ordered”&lt;/a&gt; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to alter its webpage on autism and vaccines, with several sections now casting doubt on vaccine safety. For example, where it previously stated that “studies have shown there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder”, it now reads “‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To write this on a public-facing website represents an about-turn for the CDC, whose advice is often sought by people looking for clarity and guidance. It also feeds into the anti-vaccine narrative that is opposed by most scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressurising the CDC represents only one of RFK Jr’s strategies to undermine the public’s trust in vaccines. This is extremely concerning, given the influence that he holds in his current position, and the &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-rfk-maha-prasad-vaccine-injury-compensation-program-autism-allergies/"&gt;effect this will have&lt;/a&gt; on vaccine policy, demand, manufacturing and, ultimately, the spread of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjuvants are a key addition to vaccines and help to increase the body’s response to vaccination, enhancing the level of protection that the recipient gains. Without adjuvants, many vaccines simply wouldn’t work or would provide only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9147349/"&gt;short-lasting protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aluminium salts, such as aluminium sulphate and aluminium hydroxide, have been used as adjuvants for almost a century. They are a key component in several vaccines, including those that protect against hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus and human papillomavirus. They have enhanced hundreds of millions of vaccine doses worldwide, which &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38705159/"&gt;saves millions of lives annually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are all exposed to aluminium daily in food, water, soil and, for babies, in breast milk. For example, some processed cheese contains up to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16019791/"&gt;15mg per slice&lt;/a&gt;. Aluminium ingested in this manner enters the bloodstream and is filtered out via the kidneys. Aluminium salts in vaccines (between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001122/"&gt;0.25 and 1.2mg of aluminium&lt;/a&gt;) also enter the bloodstream and are removed from the body in the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that the amounts of aluminium that enter the body after vaccination are extremely small, pose &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001122/"&gt;no risk of toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, and the amount of aluminium in the body is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28919482/"&gt;not linked&lt;/a&gt; to how many vaccines you’ve had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40658954/"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from Denmark examined aluminium exposure in the first two years of life in over 1 million children. This study confirmed that there is no link between exposure and any of 50 diseases that were looked at, including autism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the other claims – such as the purported link to autoimmune disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autoimmunity is an umbrella term encompassing a broad spectrum of diseases where the body’s immune system attacks itself. Some people have claimed that vaccines can induce autoimmunity. However, studies in vaccine recipients have shown convincing evidence that this is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28888842/"&gt;not the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is thought highly unlikely that vaccines cause asthma, allergies or other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14871632/"&gt;serious harms&lt;/a&gt;. Vaccine safety is thoroughly evaluated before any vaccine is approved, and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-vaccine-safety"&gt;safety monitoring&lt;/a&gt; continues for all vaccines after they become available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it is apparent that diagnoses of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4113600/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma-data/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fasthma%2Fasthmadata.htm"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/asthma-data/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fasthma%2Fasthmadata.htm"&gt;allergies&lt;/a&gt; are on the rise. If vaccines are not the reason, then what is? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too clean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea that has been proposed is the “hygiene hypothesis”. It suggests that society has become too clean. As such, lack of exposure to many germs during childhood may deprive the immune system of essential “training” and therefore it &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33971339/"&gt;reacts excessively&lt;/a&gt; to otherwise harmless particles, such as pollen, dust and nuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The hygiene hypothesis is one explanation for the rise in allergies.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/female-housekeeping-hands-gloves-cleaning-counter-2119458362?trackingId=1159b33d-b426-408b-a284-04b7e7b73cee"&gt;RomanR/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors probably also play a role, including improved detection and diagnosis, environmental and prenatal influences, and, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7503605/"&gt;in the case of asthma&lt;/a&gt;, increased air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing vaccine hesitancy and reduced vaccination rates lead to more vulnerable people and more infectious diseases, illnesses and deaths. It is important to question medical interventions, but this questioning should be informed, rational and open. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccines remain one of the most cost-effective, safe and important public health interventions – and we undermine public trust in vaccines at our peril.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

With crops failing and fears of starvation rising, some wealthy Italian city-states like Florence and Venice imported grain from elsewhere in the world. And on those ships most likely came plague-infected fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c11bf5" class="body-graf"&gt;The actions of Florence’s leaders prevented mass starvation —  tens of thousands of famine refugees migrated there, and the city was able to feed them in addition to its own citizens. But the imports unwittingly ushered in a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85646a" class="body-graf"&gt;City leaders were proud of their accomplishment in providing enough food for so many people, said Martin Bauch, an author of the new study and a medieval historian at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b10234" class="body-graf"&gt;“They couldn’t have an idea of what danger was there,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe451a" class="body-graf"&gt;The research offers a historical example of the way that changes in the climate can alter human societies and animal ecosystems in hard-to-predict ways and with incredible downstream consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c6d657" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have debated and chased details of the plague’s origin and spread for decades, but this study is the first to outline in detail the potential role of a volcanic eruption. Previous research has suggested climate shifts could be responsible for introductions of the plague at various points in history, but most studies were vague about it, according to Henry Fell, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e8470" class="body-graf"&gt;“This paper, I think, is really good for being quite specific on the mechanism that’s driving it,” said Fell, who was not involved in the study but has studied the Black Death and climate change. “We can see grain trade increasing from these ports, and the cause of it is climate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74ac69" class="body-graf"&gt;Volcanic eruptions can cool the planet by injecting forms of sulfur into the stratosphere, which reduces the amount of sunshine that can reach Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00d3da" class="body-graf"&gt;“It literally blocks out some of the sun that leads to cooling,” Fell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddba39" class="body-graf"&gt;The effect can last several years after significant eruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd5f6c" class="body-graf"&gt;To understand 14th century volcanic activity for the new study, researchers reviewed tree ring records, data from ice cores and written historical observations. All three lines of evidence agreed: A cooling period and a Mediterranean famine from 1345 to 1347 preceded and coincided with the plague’s emergence in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896109" class="body-graf"&gt;The team studied the chemical composition of ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica, since layers of ice in polar regions can trap chemicals from when snow originally fell, offering a kind of timeline. They found that the year 1345 had the 18th-strongest signal for sulfur in the last 2,000 years. The amount of material injected into the stratosphere that year exceeded the best recent example of that dynamic, the&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna43415342" target="_blank"&gt; Mount Pinatubo injection of 1991&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-238ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Meanwhile, tree rings dating to the same period have biological stains called “blue rings” that indicate stress and a likely cold spell. The blue rings appear consecutively, an extreme rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-815192" class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, written accounts from the time in present-day China, Japan, Germany, France and Italy report less sunshine and an increase in cloudiness, the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d44498" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers could not pinpoint which particular volcano or volcanoes erupted in 1345. But they did determine the region of the world: “​This must be a tropical eruption,” Bauch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59c00d" class="body-graf"&gt;The reason: Ice cores from both of Earth’s poles had roughly equal measures of volcanic sulfate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-619d11" class="body-graf"&gt;Historical records show reports of crop failures and high prices for wheat during that cool period, with severe famine in large parts of Spain, southern France, Italy, Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, according to the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-34821e" class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, Italian city-states were wealthy, Bauch said, and had developed storage systems for grain and huge trade networks established over centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25c181" class="body-graf"&gt;But as famine deepened, their options dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5f4c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“They really start to realize in 1347, ‘We have to import from the Black Sea. That’s the last place where they still have enough grain for our needs,’” Bauch said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0cf7b6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Of course, they’re not aware of how the plague gets to them,” he added. “I have records from Venice in 1349, and they’re really satisfied, and they say, ‘Look, in the last famine, the Black Sea grain really saved us, and that worked very well.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e953d" class="body-graf"&gt;Bauch said he suspects that the plague most likely would have reached Europe eventually but that the events initiated by the volcanic eruptions were likely to have accelerated the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06e312" class="body-graf"&gt;As much as 60% of the population died in parts of Europe from 1347 to 1353, making it one of the deadliest periods in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-83b557" class="body-graf"&gt;Past research on the plague’s origins has relied on written accounts, archaeological evidence and even genetic clues. In 2022, scientists found DNA evidence of the bacterium that causes the plague &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ancient-teeth-offer-new-insight-black-death-emerged-spread-globally-rcna33329" target="_blank"&gt;in bodies buried in modern-day Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; — far east of Europe. Grave markers indicate that many of those killed were buried in 1338 and 1339 (about a decade before the plague hit Europe) and that they died of “pestilence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-7738fa"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg" alt="Yersinia Pestis"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Yersinia pestis bacteria, which cause bubonic plague in animals and humans, are usually transmitted by the bites of infected rat fleas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;BSIP / Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f783bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The same research group also discovered that marmots living today in the Tian Shan mountain range near the burial site carry a closely related strain of the bacterium, which is a clue that the Black Death could have emerged in that location before it spread elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-673f5e" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study could explain what happened next, Fell said, adding that he thought the authors made a convincing argument that a volcano was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84938c" class="body-graf"&gt;After the plague first exploded in Europe, it re-emerged for centuries, reshaping human history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2131c7" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“In a European context, it’s so important to our history,” Fell said. “Any study where you’re looking at a long time period across Europe, there’ll be a plague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPaFI1c0hLb1FHb3FEVG9tR3RseXlYU2RjNjJvNExQZWMxbFI4dlFNRWpjUGxFLWFTMElCWjNpQlo5b0ZndnQzOVRiV3gxQXR1NmIyc21Td1JvU2VWRDAzVm1SUzlBNG1Ua1VRVWhhZTUyMVpnVjl3WjJNMnh6QzAyQWduYlFNWnduV2NDRllfQzF3aDVFN2xVVNIBVkFVX3lxTE1jLWVENFZQMDdjWk5kcVNrSlltbF9CbV9NMzlfQnVTT01PRXJudjVUbDZweTZHdUZSeDhVZ3lFV2FaTGpxdEM3dXJWNURTQXMtaDVvT0lB</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现，火山爆发引发了导致黑死病的“蝴蝶效应” - Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/volcanic-eruption-triggered-butterfly-effect-that-led-to-the-black-death-researchers-find</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;
&lt;p id="fe9fce6d-19df-4ea4-bc29-2f8058cdc384"&gt;An unknown volcanic eruption in the mid-14th century may have set the stage for the spread of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-was-the-black-death.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-was-the-black-death.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Black Death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, according to a new study. By triggering a cool and overcast period in the Mediterranean, the eruption started a domino effect that led to a downturn in agricultural production, which required merchants to import grain — and the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; that causes bubonic plague — via the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubonic plague &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known as the Black Death, reached Europe in 1347 and quickly affected Italian port cities. The plague then spread throughout Europe over the next few years, resulting in the deaths of between 30% and 60% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fe9fce6d-19df-4ea4-bc29-2f8058cdc384-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.leibniz-gwzo.de/en/institute/team-z/martin-bauch" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.leibniz-gwzo.de/en/institute/team-z/martin-bauch" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Martin Bauch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a historian at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe in Germany, told Live Science in an email that one very specific aspect of the plague pandemic intrigued him: "How and why did the Black Death reach Italy from the Black Sea at precisely this moment?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ee70e07d-814c-4dc5-8b91-dab788d5ba4e"&gt;To answer this question, Bauch and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/buentgen/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/buentgen/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ulf Büntgen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a geographer at the University of Cambridge, investigated climate-driven changes in the Mediterranean that could explain the sudden appearance of the Black Death in 1347. Their research was published Thursday (Dec. 4) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6075740241125072610&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43247-025-02964-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fplanet-earth%2Fvolcanic-eruption-triggered-butterfly-effect-that-led-to-the-black-death-researchers-find" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02964-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43247-025-02964-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fplanet-earth%2Fvolcanic-eruption-triggered-butterfly-effect-that-led-to-the-black-death-researchers-find" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Communications Earth &amp;amp; Environment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combing through contemporaneous historical accounts, the researchers noticed reports of reduced sunshine, increased cloudiness and a dark &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-lunar-eclipse" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-lunar-eclipse"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lunar eclipse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all independently reported by observers in parts of Asia and Europe between 1345 and 1349. All of these astronomical and weather phenomena could be attributed to a large-scale volcanic aerosol layer, which has been known to cause cold spells as the sulfate aerosols &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/did-the-tonga-eruption-cause-this-years-extreme-heat" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/did-the-tonga-eruption-cause-this-years-extreme-heat"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reflect sunlight back into space&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paleoclimate data gave the researchers a clue: High amounts of sulfur in polar ice cores suggested one or more eruptions of a previously unknown volcano around 1345.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cannot say very much about the volcanic eruption," Bauch said. "From the ice cores, we know that the eruption must have taken place in the tropics, because sulfate was found in similar concentrations in the ice of both the North and South Poles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ShiS3yaKkF8C8esueN37Li" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ShiS3yaKkF8C8esueN37Li slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at tree-ring data from around Europe and discovered that the summers of 1345, 1346 and 1347 were much colder than normal while the autumns were much wetter, causing soil erosion and flooding. Historical records also confirmed that changes in the environment had decreased the yield of a number of crops, including the grape harvest and grain production in Italy, requiring merchants to begin importing products from the Black Sea area to prevent famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Upon return in the second half of 1347 CE, the Italian trade fleets, however, not only brought grain back to the Mediterranean harbours, but also carried the plague bacterium &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; most likely via fleas that were feeding on grain dust during their long journey," the researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cases of plague in humans were reported in Venice just a few weeks after the arrival of the last grain ships. "This initiates the typical infection cycle," Bauch said. "Rodent populations are infected first; once they die off, the fleas shift to other mammals and ultimately to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importing grain after several years' worth of volcano-induced climate change therefore prevented a Mediterranean-wide famine but also introduced the Black Death into Europe, the study authors proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8e905f28-6fa2-4de2-9463-4a232ad8f84f"&gt;"This study brings in new information on the 1345 volcano, which helps explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the Black Death — that is, the epidemic well-documented in sources from 1346 to 1350 — happened when it did," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Kh8rT0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Kh8rT0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monica H. Green&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an independent scholar and expert on the Black Death who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. "But it happened &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it did — with a 'plague infrastructure' of rodents and insect vectors already established — because &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/medical-history/article/plague-history-mongol-history-and-the-processes-of-focalisation-leading-up-to-the-black-death-a-response-to-brack-et-al/F38569656E9104D86612103560AE66EF" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/medical-history/article/plague-history-mongol-history-and-the-processes-of-focalisation-leading-up-to-the-black-death-a-response-to-brack-et-al/F38569656E9104D86612103560AE66EF" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;local reservoirs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had already been established."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onset of the Black Death resulted from a unique-but-random combination of short-term factors, like climate, and long-term factors, like the grain distribution system in Italy, the researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the Black Death resulted from a rare confluence of environmental and social factors, it's important to gain a better understanding of the causes of past pandemics, the researchers wrote, because "the probability of zoonotic infectious diseases to emerge and translate into pandemics is likely to increase in both a globalised and warmer world."&lt;/p&gt;

A new national analysis finds that soil organic carbon can break down more than tenfold faster in some samples than in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That imbalance makes these new results important for climate forecasts and for programs that pay landowners to keep carbon in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-soil-carbon-matters"&gt;Why soil carbon matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic matter in soil breaks down over time, sending some carbon into the air as carbon dioxide and leaving some stored underground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Chaoqun Lu, an associate professor at &lt;a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; who studies how land ecosystems store and release carbon. Her research focuses on the processes that shape long term soil carbon change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soils worldwide hold more carbon than the atmosphere and all vegetation together, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31540-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; that combined measurements from many ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of that long lasting carbon sits as mineral-associated organic carbon, carbon that sticks to fine particles and can stay in soil for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Earth system models, tools that track &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-warming-may-trigger-rapid-release-of-soil-carbon/"&gt;exchanges of carbon&lt;/a&gt;, water, and energy between land, ocean, and air, still struggle with soil carbon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evaluation&lt;a href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/19/4671/2022/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;of the latest generation of these models found large errors in how much soil carbon they predict across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study tackles one missing piece, the basic tendency of different soils to release carbon once microbes begin working on organic matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call that tendency intrinsic decomposability, the base decay rate measured under the same temperature and moisture before outside stresses are added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-soil-carbon-systems"&gt;Studying soil carbon systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., the team used the National Ecological Observatory Network (&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/infrastructure/national-ecological-observatory-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NEON&lt;/a&gt;), a nationwide facility that tracks ecosystems at field sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that system they selected 20 locations, ranging from deserts to forests, and collected 156 soil samples for intensive lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, each soil sample spent 18 months in controlled temperature and moisture. During that period, researchers tracked carbon dioxide coming off the soil and traits such as pH, nitrogen, and microbial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those measurements fed into a mechanistic soil model that estimated two key numbers for each sample, its decay rate and its carbon use efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon use efficiency, the share of decomposed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rivers-carry-hidden-carbon-that-shapes-earths-climate/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; microbes kept in bodies instead of exhaled as gas, shows how carbon stays in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then used machine learning to test which of 26 measured soil properties best explained differences in those decay rates and efficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well known factors such as soil type, pH, and nitrogen remained important, but fungal abundance and certain iron and aluminum forms also stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-minerals-microbes-and-controls"&gt;Minerals, microbes, and controls&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have increasingly learned that interactions between organic matter and minerals often decide whether carbon stays in soil or escapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10840363/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; showed that iron and aluminum oxides form tight bonds with organic molecules, slowing their breakdown across many soil types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new analysis, soils richer in those metals and fungi showed slower decay and higher carbon use efficiency in mineral associated carbon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, soils where most carbon sat in loose particles with fewer protective minerals released a larger share as gas once microbes decomposed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists refer to that loose pool as particulate organic carbon, relatively fresh plant material and fragments that typically decompose within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this fraction is more exposed to microbes and less bound to minerals, it often responds faster to warming or shifts in moisture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, many modeling studies have treated soils of the same type or biome as sharing one base decay rate when conditions stay constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-soil-behavior-across-the-u-s"&gt;Soil behavior across the U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the fitted model, the team produced national maps that estimate decay rate and carbon use efficiency for both particulate and mineral-associated carbon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each mapped cell covers roughly a square 2.5 miles on a side, fine enough to capture differences between regions that share the same climate label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting maps show that soils in the Southwest break down carbon faster and send more of it into the air as carbon dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northwest and much of the East, decomposition runs slowly and more carbon becomes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-microbes-frozen-for-40000-years-thaw-revive-reorganize-devour-carbon/"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt; biomass, while the Midwest shows intermediate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern highlights stable pockets of soil carbon in parts of the Northwest and eastern United States, where mineral-associated pools are abundant and decay rates stay low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, regions with thinner protective mineral layers or disturbance may see soil carbon stocks shrink faster when climate warms or land use changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-soil-carbon"&gt;Lessons from soil carbon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth system simulations guide carbon budgets for countries and companies, and they also underpin many land based carbon offset projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those simulations underestimate how fast some soils lose carbon or overestimate persistence elsewhere, climate plans built on them can be off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expect other modeling groups to start using their parameter maps as inputs to improve simulations of carbon climate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the policy side, the regional differences in carbon retention suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-land-use-has-removed-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-sequestration/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; market rules may need to look beyond simple totals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the team explained that carbon held longer in certain regions may offer greater long term benefits than identical amounts stored elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land managers could use this mapping to decide where practices like cover crops and forest restoration will keep carbon in soil longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As similar studies extend to other continents, soils that once looked uniform in climate models start to show detailed patterns that can guide decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/abstract/S2590-3322%2825%2900342-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;
