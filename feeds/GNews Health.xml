&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newborn circumcision rates in the US fell from 54% in 2012 to 49% in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;White families saw the sharpest drop, while Black and Hispanic rates stayed steady.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wealthier and privately insured families had higher rates but also bigger declines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers point to rising skepticism toward medicine and Hispanic population growth as possible factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE —&lt;/strong&gt; Circumcision among newborn boys in the United States has steadily declined over the past decade, even as leading health organizations have voiced support for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University of more than 1.5 million annual hospital records shows the share of newborn boys circumcised during their first month of life fell from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This decline came after the World Health Organization (2007), the American Academy of Pediatrics (2012), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018) each issued &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-circumcision-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommendations supporting access&lt;/a&gt; to newborn circumcision. These groups highlighted research linking the procedure with lower risks of urinary tract infections, penile inflammation, and transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-white-families-account-for-the-largest-circumcision-decline"&gt;White Families Account for the Largest Circumcision Decline&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trends varied sharply across racial and ethnic groups. For White newborns, circumcision prevalence was 61.0% in 2012, rose to a peak of 65.3% in 2019, and then declined to 60.0% in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Black families maintained the highest rates at about 66% throughout the study period, while Hispanic families consistently had the lowest at around 21%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regional differences were just as pronounced. Hospitals in the Midwest recorded the highest prevalence at 68.5% in 2022, while Western hospitals reported only 19.7%. Among White families in the West, circumcision dropped from 34.3% in 2012 to 26.2% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wealth-and-insurance-status-shape-decisions"&gt;Wealth and Insurance Status Shape Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Household income&lt;/a&gt; and insurance coverage also influenced circumcision choices. Parents in the wealthiest zip codes started with higher rates (59.4% in 2012) but saw some of the steepest declines, falling to 51.1% by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insurance patterns told a similar story. Families with private coverage had the highest baseline prevalence, 64.2% in 2012, yet their rate fell sharply to 56.3% in 2022. Medicaid-covered families showed smaller shifts, with circumcision declining from 44.5% to 42.3% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Policy changes may have contributed. By 2011, 17 states had ended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medicaid coverage&lt;/a&gt; for routine newborn circumcision, creating financial hurdles for some families. Still, researchers noted that cost alone cannot explain the overall decline, since reductions were also seen among privately insured families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-factors-and-changing-attitudes-towards-circumcision"&gt;Cultural Factors and Changing Attitudes Towards Circumcision&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors note that several factors may contribute to why parents are choosing circumcision less often despite medical endorsements. The American Academy of Pediatrics affirms that the health benefits outweigh the risks but stresses that the decision should remain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with parents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They highlight increased skepticism toward medical recommendations in the United States and the continual growth of the Hispanic population and births, given that Hispanic families have consistently low circumcision rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.2464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that rates among Black newborns stayed stable across regions, while White newborns showed the largest decreases. The authors did not investigate reasons for these racial differences, only documenting their persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-medical-guidance-meets-parental-autonomy"&gt;Medical Guidance Meets Parental Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on the Kids’ Inpatient Database, a nationally representative sample of pediatric hospitalizations. They examined circumcision procedures performed within 28 days of birth, identified through billing codes. This design captures most newborn circumcisions, though not those performed in outpatient clinics or later in infancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limitations include possible underreporting due to coding sensitivity, lack of state-level identifiers, and the fact that the database counts hospital discharges rather than unique infants. Still, the study represents the most comprehensive national picture available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2022, medical organizations offered some of their clearest endorsements of circumcision’s health benefits. Yet parents moved in the opposite direction, choosing the procedure less often. The gap between institutional recommendations and family decisions underscores how health behaviors reflect more than clinical guidance alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors concluded, circumcision trends reflect a mix of demographic change, cultural views, and shifting trust in healthcare—factors that shape decisions even when medical benefits are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article is for general information only and should not be taken as medical advice. Parents should consult healthcare professionals when making decisions about circumcision or other procedures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the Kids’ Inpatient Database from 2012 to 2022, examining over 1.5 million hospital records of male newborns aged 0-28 days each year. They excluded babies with bleeding disorders, penile abnormalities, or premature births. The team used medical billing codes to identify circumcision procedures and applied statistical weights to generate national estimates. They calculated annual circumcision rates and used regression analysis to measure changes over time across different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall circumcision rates declined from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022. White families drove most of the decline, with rates dropping from 65.3% to 60%. Black families maintained stable rates around 66%, while Hispanic families remained at about 21%. The Midwest had the highest rates (68.5%) and the West the lowest (19.7%). Wealthier families and those with private insurance had higher circumcision rates but experienced the largest declines during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study only captured hospital-based circumcisions using billing codes, which may underestimate total circumcision rates due to coding issues or outpatient procedures. The database tracks hospital discharges rather than individual patients, so multiple hospitalizations for the same baby appear as separate records. State-level data wasn’t available, limiting analysis of policy effects. The study was restricted to the first 28 days of life, potentially missing some procedures performed later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study received partial funding from a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases grant (R01DK131926). Dr. Tobian reported receiving National Institutes of Health grants during the study. The researchers stated that funders had no role in study design, data analysis, or publication decisions. No other conflicts of interest were reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-information"&gt;Publication Information&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research letter “Trends in Circumcision Among Newborn Males in the US” was published online September 15, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.2464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The study was conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, led by Ping Yang and Dr. Aaron A.R. Tobian. The paper was accepted for publication on June 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Take these steps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; for better search results, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=lifehacker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="open in a new window"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including adding my work at Lifehacker as a preferred source&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually focus on something a subset of the population gets wrong, so the rest of us can feel smart, but this week, I’m going bigger and broader, and describing something that you, me, and everyone we have ever met has been wrong about in the past, is currently wrong about, and will be wrong about in the future: mistaking correlation for causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have been repeating some variation of "correlation is not causation" since at least 1739, when David Hume articulated the concept in &lt;em&gt;A Treatise on Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;. To paraphrase Hume: Just because two things happen at the same time doesn’t mean one is causing the other. Every smart person already already knows this, and it's repeated constantly, but we all still get it wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2025/07/31/correlation-dressed-up-as-causation-the-reality-of-microbiome-science/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;20 years of research on "gut biomes"&lt;/a&gt; could be wrong, partly as a result of both scientists and the media mistaking correlation and causation. (I've always had a gut feeling—get it?—this research was suspect.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years people believed that drinking alcohol in moderation is good for your health. But it isn't. It's &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9653126/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;better health in some populations&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of mistaken beliefs derived from the correlation/causation fallacy will often compile volumes of data that shows a nearly exact correlations between, say, higher rates of autism and higher rates of vaccination, which makes it totally understandable to believe one causes the other. But there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;no evidence that vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, and the correlation is probably because children received vaccines around the age autism is generally diagnosed, and we've gotten better at both vaccinating children and diagnosing autism. But "probably" is doing some lifting in that sentence. While no causal link between vaccines and autism has ever been demonstrated, there could be any number of reasons the rates line up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic debunking examples of correlation and causation, like the link between &lt;a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2025/06/17/glp-spaces-on-x-ice-cream-sales-increase-drowning-confusing-correlation-and-causation-yields-strange-and-often-harmful-results" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;ice cream sales and shark attacks&lt;/a&gt;, tend to offer a pat explanation for the causal link—it only seems like ice cream causes shark attacks because both ice cream sales and swimming in the ocean rise when the weather is warmer—but even that is potentially mistaking correlation for causation. It makes sense, but we don’t actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; why those two numbers line up. And sometimes there just isn't any reason for connection between two pieces of disparate information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the chart below. It's &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; that the ratings of &lt;em&gt;Two and Half Men&lt;/em&gt; directly correlates with the amount of jet fuel used in Serbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="eloquent-imagery-image"&gt;

                    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the second example on Tyler Vigen's &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Spurious Correlations&lt;/a&gt;, with a tool that will lets you &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious/discover" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;make random connections all day.&lt;/a&gt; Not only that, the site uses AI to generate &lt;a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious/research-papers/2700_fueling-laughter-exploring-the-comedic-connection-between-two-and-a-half-men-season-ratings-and-jet-fuel-consumption-in-serbia.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;bogus "research papers&lt;/a&gt;" to explain the connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the cats, ChatGPT offers this as a possible explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health-conscious households (those that track diet, buy fruit, etc.) are more likely to treat even minor injuries cautiously. A person who eats more fruit is not more likely to be scratched, but they are more likely to Google 'my cat scratched me' to check for infection risks or treatment steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I know it's bullshit, it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;tracks&lt;/em&gt;. That's why we can never really stop being wrong in this specific way. Our brains &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe. A neatly phrased explanation, a tidy chart, a plausible-sounding theory—it's so &lt;em&gt;satisfying&lt;/em&gt;.  A simple "we don't know" can't hold a candle to that certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistaking correlation for causation makes us go on fad diets and believe we're being healthy by drinking wine at dinner. It shapes health advice, public policy, and personal decisions in ways that can actually hurt people. The best we can do is try to be aware of it—when we read a headline that says "X causes Y," to assume this is a "cat scratches cause fruit consumption" situation until there's evidence that it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;There's a particular quality some older people have—a spark that makes you forget you're talking to someone who remembers when television was new. They drop perfectly timed jokes, recall obscure facts with startling clarity, and somehow manage to stay current without trying too hard. These aren't just the genetically blessed. They're people who've figured out that staying mentally sharp isn't about sudoku puzzles and crosswords alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between those who remain vibrant conversationalists at 75 and those who retreat into repetitive stories isn't luck. It's a collection of habits, attitudes, and deliberate choices that keep their minds flexible while their joints might not be. These rules aren't complicated or expensive—they're accessible to anyone willing to rethink what aging means for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They treat curiosity like oxygen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest septuagenarians approach new information like they're still 25 and figuring out the world. They ask follow-up questions about your job, genuinely want to understand cryptocurrency, and aren't afraid to admit when something confuses them. This isn't politeness—it's intellectual survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity prevents the mind from calcifying around old assumptions. When you stop asking "why" and "how," your brain stops building new neural pathways. The mentally agile elderly understand that learning isn't just for the young—it's what keeps you young. They read books outside their comfort zone, watch documentaries about subjects they know nothing about, and aren't embarrassed to be beginners at something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They collect experiences, not just memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a difference between having stories and having the same story. Sharp older adults keep adding chapters to their lives instead of just rereading the old ones. They try the new restaurant, take the unfamiliar route, say yes to invitations that younger them might have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about bungee jumping at 80. It's about maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1232670/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking to new situations. Every new experience forces the brain to create fresh connections. The mentally vibrant understand that routine might be comfortable, but variation is what keeps neurons firing. They know that the phrase "I've never tried that before" should never fully leave your vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They embrace technology without surrendering to it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wittiest older adults have smartphones and know how to use them, but they're not enslaved by them. They've learned enough technology to stay connected and informed without letting it overwhelm their identity or dominate their time. They text their grandkids, share memes that actually land, and can navigate streaming services without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the key: they use technology as a tool, not a crutch. They understand that digital engagement opens doors to information and connection, but they don't mistake online interaction for real relationships. They've found the sweet spot between being a Luddite and being lost in the digital world. Their social media posts are coherent, but they also don't live for likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They maintain friendships across generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart 70-somethings don't just hang out with other 70-somethings. They cultivate friendships across age groups, not as mentors or authority figures, but as genuine peers. They have coffee with 40-year-olds, debate politics with 30-year-olds, and aren't threatened by 20-year-olds who know things they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross-generational mixing prevents the echo chamber effect that can make older adults feel disconnected from contemporary life. Younger friends bring fresh perspectives, new vocabulary, and different problems to solve. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163721001471" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intergenerational connections&lt;/a&gt; can improve cognitive function and social well-being. The mentally sharp elderly understand these friendships aren't about feeling young—they're about staying relevant and engaged with the world as it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They laugh at themselves first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest wit often belongs to those who've learned not to take themselves too seriously. They'll joke about their "senior moments," their technological struggles, their creaking joints—but never in a self-pitying way. They've weaponized self-deprecation as a form of connection, not defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This humor serves a deeper purpose than just getting laughs. Self-directed humor is actually a sophisticated cognitive function that requires perspective-taking and emotional regulation. When you can laugh at your own limitations, you're demonstrating mental flexibility and resilience. The sharpest seniors know that taking yourself too seriously is the fastest way to become a caricature of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They read like their brain depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just newspapers or their favorite genre—they read widely, voraciously, and challengingly. Fiction, non-fiction, long-form journalism, even the occasional graphic novel. They treat reading not as a pastime but as cognitive maintenance, each book a different exercise for different mental muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is variety. Reading only political books that confirm your views is like only doing bicep curls at the gym. The mentally sharp mix it up: a mystery novel followed by a history of jazz, a memoir paired with science writing. They understand that every new author's voice, every unfamiliar subject, forces the brain to work harder, stay more agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They pick their battles and forget the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp seniors have learned what's worth arguing about and what isn't. They'll engage in spirited debates about things that matter but won't waste energy correcting every wrong opinion or fighting every slight. They've developed what might be called selective passion—intense when it counts, relaxed when it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't apathy; it's wisdom. It requires the prefrontal cortex to override the emotional brain's need to be right all the time. Those who stay sharp understand that mental energy is finite, and spending it on petty grievances leaves less for creativity, humor, and genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They stay physically active without being obsessive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest minds past 70 usually inhabit bodies that move regularly. Not marathon-running necessarily, but walking, swimming, gardening—something that gets blood flowing to the brain. They understand the brain-body connection isn't just wellness-speak; it's biological fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they're not fanatics. They don't bore you with their step count or lecture about their workout routine. They've found sustainable ways to stay active that feel more like living than exercising. Movement is integrated into life, not segregated into gym time. Research consistently shows that even moderate exercise can significantly improve cognitive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They create more than they consume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's writing letters, cooking new recipes, woodworking, or watercolors, mentally sharp seniors are makers, not just takers. They produce something—anything—that didn't exist before they created it. This isn't about talent or skill; it's about the act of creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating requires the brain to work in ways that consuming never will. It demands problem-solving, planning, and adaptation when things don't go as expected. The act of creation, regardless of the medium, builds cognitive reserve—the brain's ability to maintain function despite age-related changes. Those who stay sharp understand that the question isn't "Am I good at this?" but "Am I engaged by this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who remain quick-witted and mentally agile past 70 haven't discovered a secret formula or won a genetic lottery. They've simply refused to accept the narrative that aging means inevitable intellectual decline. They've chosen engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, growth over stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules aren't really rules at all—they're invitations to remain fully alive regardless of age. They recognize that the brain, like any muscle, responds to how you use it. The sharp seniors among us have figured out that wit isn't about being young; it's about being interested. They know that mental agility isn't about denying age; it's about embracing complexity at any age. Most importantly, they understand that staying sharp isn't just about cognitive exercise—it's about maintaining a fundamental belief that there's always something new to learn, someone interesting to meet, and something worth laughing about. Even—especially—yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flu shots are now available at many pharmacies, doctors’ offices, and clinics around the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccine is the most effective way to protect against severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the changes to COVID vaccine eligibility this year, the CDC and professional medical organizations still recommend everyone get the vaccine this fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Federal health agencies are expected to make substantial changes to vaccine guidance this fall. However, the flu vaccine recommendation remains the same: &lt;strong&gt;everyone older than 6 months should get an annual flu shot.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As many as 1.3 million Americans were hospitalized with the flu in the last flu season, and up to 130,000 people died from the disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The flu shot is both safe and life-saving&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.southnassau.org/sn/find-a-doctor/glatt-aaron-e-md-macp-fidsa-fshea-chair-department-26" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Aaron Glatt, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what you need to know as you prepare for your flu shot this year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/who-should-not-get-flu-shots-770429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no differences in who can get a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it for all people ages 6 months or older, with rare exceptions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fall-covid-vaccine-guide-11777880" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;changes to COVID-10 vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; don’t apply to flu vaccines. The agency’s advisory panel is scheduled to meet in late September to discuss routine vaccines against COVID and other diseases, but not the flu vaccine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The vaccines are available now in many pharmacies, clinics, and doctors’ offices across the country. Flu cases typically pick up in October and peak in February, though that varies by year and region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Glatt said it’s wise to get your flu shot sooner rather than later to ensure you’re protected when flu rears its head in your community. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“You should have very good immunity in September that will last you through the flu season. Waiting until October isn't necessarily a dangerous thing if there's no flu around, but you probably want to have immunity when flu comes to your region,” Glatt said.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; He added that it's still worthwhile to get the flu shot even if you haven’t gotten one by the end of October. Flu circulates in most places until April, and it’s helpful to be protected through the winter and early spring. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-you-get-it-the-same-time-as-your-covid-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can You Get It the Same Time as Your COVID Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the COVID vaccines debuted in 2021, the CDC and medical groups have said that &lt;strong&gt;people can safely get the COVID and flu shots at the same time without diminishing their effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a late August &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/188486/download" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA’s top vaccine official said he “cannot affirm” that co-administering the vaccines is safe and effective and that the agency would start requiring vaccine makers to run clinical trials before making that claim.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.taskforce.org/employees/joe-bresee/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joseph Bresee, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of respiratory virus prevention and preparedness at The Task Force for Global Health, said that there is sound evidence that the practice is safe and people should feel comfortable getting their COVID and flu shots in the same visit while the FDA collects more data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “More importantly, the ability to get vaccines together during the same visit creates an opportunity to expand the reach of these vaccines,” Bresee told Verywell. “If you make folks come back for one vaccine and then another vaccine in two weeks, you may lose some folks and miss the opportunity to get them vaccinated.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-will-the-flu-shot-cost"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much Will the Flu Shot Cost? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you have health insurance, the flu vaccine should be free to you.&lt;/strong&gt; Insurers are required to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC’s advisory panel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are uninsured, the cost for a shot at a pharmacy could be as low as $20 or over $100. Many cities offer low- or no-cost vaccines to people without insurance at public health clinics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-you-get-a-nasal-spray-flu-vaccine-instead"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can You Get a Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine Instead? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can now order the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-the-nasal-flu-vaccine-flumist-770756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FluMist nasal spray vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to your home.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This allows caretakers to give the vaccine or for people to self-administer without visiting a pharmacy or doctor’s office.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The nasal spray is safe and effective for people ages 2 to 49 years old who are not pregnant or immunocompromised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s a nice option for people who have trouble getting to the doctor or the clinic, who are homebound for whatever reason,” Bresee said. “Many of those people are at higher risk for severe disease because they have underlying illnesses, and that's the reason they can't leave the house as easily.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-effective-is-the-flu-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Effective Is the Flu Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We won’t know exactly how effective this year’s flu vaccine is until around February.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-5211793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flu vaccine formula changes every year&lt;/a&gt; based on predictions from global health experts about which viral strains will circulate in the upcoming season. &lt;strong&gt;When the strains are well matched, the vaccine is usually between 40% and 60% effective at preventing severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's important to realize that getting the flu vaccine doesn't mean that you won't get the flu,” Glatt said. “Get vaccinated: if you do get the flu, you'll probably have a much milder episode. It certainly has been shown that it prevents hospitalizations, it prevents serious illness, and it prevents death.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The FDA recently expanded eligibility for the Flublok vaccine, a recombinant flu vaccine, to people as young as 9 years old.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flublok uses a different technology than standard flu vaccines, which has been shown to be more effective in older adults. The CDC says all the options available for people younger than 65 are similarly effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Flu vaccines are very, very safe vaccines. They've been given hundreds of millions of times over decades, and &lt;strong&gt;the most common side effects are locally sore arms or a little redness around for about 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;,” Bresee said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, they're very safe, and we shouldn't expect any new side effects popping up this year.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who has had significant allergic reactions to the flu or other vaccines in the past should talk to a health care provider before getting the shot. Otherwise, the vaccine is safe for just about everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your doctor is your best source of information. He knows you. He knows your history,” Glatt said. “The CDC, professional society websites, and the Department of Health remain, at this point in time, excellent resources for information.”

To stay healthy and avoid getting others sick, make it a habit to wash your hands, cover your cough, stay home when you’re sick, and wear a mask if you’re contagious or worried about exposure. If you have flu, your doctor can prescribe you Tamiflu to help manage the symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As a GP myself, I knew how serious my condition was,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/burnout-relief-techniquest-longevity-alka-patel-rl5r2vrkg"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; of her 2011 health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With three children and a successful but often stressful career, Dr Patel admitted that she never slowed down enough to notice the red-flag warning signs that she was about to crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to hospital by her husband—Mandish, a dentist—after her temperature continued to climb past 38C, where she underwent emergency abdominal surgery, as doctors suspected an abscess in her abdomen could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they found nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being discharged following a month-long recovery stint in hospital, Dr Patel knew something needed to change, as it dawned on her that her resilience to stress after years of pushing the brink of burnout was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 14 years later, aged 53, Dr Patel has turned back the clock and has an impressive biological age—the age of her cells—of a 20-year-old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alka Patel was hospitalised as her organs began to shut down before she hit reset—tracking everything from her blood sugar, sleep and heart rate to turn back her biological clock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strange as it sounds, science shows we can bring our age down in measurable ways,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm proof of this. And while biohacking might bring to mind wealthy tech titans trying to live forever, many of the techniques I now tech clients as a longevity doctor are free, take minutes and can add decades to our lives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Your biological age is not an ego-fuelled number—it's your health forecast. By dropping your biological age, we can liver longer, with less pain, more energy and agility and with fewer prescriptions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here the Daily Mail breaks down her daily routine, in which she prioritises sleep, diet and exercise for a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The power of a good routine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite advising her patients to get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep a night, Dr Patel rarely got more than four hours a night, working long after her children had gone to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, she has devised a night time routine that slows down ageing by allowing the body to repair cells, replenish depleted energy levels and clear toxic brain matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every night she sets an alarm for 9.30pm which signals her screen curfew, before she gets into bed an hour later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel discovered that her stress levels, which contribute to inflammation when raised, were not dropping low enough at night to allow for deep restorative sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have long urged people to ditch screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a hormone produced naturally in the body that plays a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, throwing off your natural wind-down process. But, experts have also warned that forcing yourself to go to bed with nothing to occupy your mind, can also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15054385/sleep-therapist-five-hacks-insomnia-WORSE.html"&gt; impact your sleep and fuel insomnia. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This hour in between switching off the TV and putting her phone on do not disturb creates the perfect wind-down window, promoting the production of melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Book in hand, Dr Patel gets into bed calm and ready for a restorative 8 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Morning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Patel starts her morning with five stretches she holds for 50 seconds—including one that works on balance, such as calf raises—whilst brushing her teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A  study of 1,7000 people aged 50-75 found people who couldn't stand on one leg for at least 10 seconds had an 84 per cent increased risk of death after seven years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This forms a central part of Dr Patel's biohacking, in which she ranks her most-used hacks from 1-10, with a correlating activity or time, to make them easier to implement—showing that no matter how busy you are, you can always find 60 seconds to turn back the clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel recommends habit stacking to implement her most-used biohacks into her routine. For example, whilst cleaning her teeth she will perform calf-raises to improve her balance (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the morning, she also practices her 1-10 hack which involves spending one minute in natural sunlight, followed by 10 seconds setting an intention for the day—with purpose being one of the key pillars of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15014419/Blue-Zone-UK-live-100-plymouth.html"&gt;blue zone centenarians. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when she takes her first three sips of water, which she does every 30 minutes for the rest of the day—with one study finding those with lower fluid intake have a 21 per cent higher risk of dying early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 10am, Dr Patel has her first meal, restricting her eating to an eight-hour window to encourage autophagy—the medical term for cell repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Midday &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After filling up on protein and fibre for lunch, Dr Patel goes for a walk or run followed by a quick dumbbell session, which she keeps under her desk at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps redirect blood glucose to the muscles, slashing the risk of diabetes by keeping blood sugar levels under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also makes sure to switch up her posture, alternating between sitting and standing at her desk every 90 minutes to boost circulation and promote heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel keeps dumbbells under her standing desk at work which she uses every day after lunch to help keep blood sugar spikes under control &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Evening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when Dr Patel practices gratitude and reflects on her day, to lower stress and improve cognitive function—implementing seven seconds of silence every 70 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Paying compliments, meanwhile, is important because it releases the bonding hormone oxytocin,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxytocin has been shown to affect the same centre of the brain as physical pain and may play a role in reducing inflammation and feelings of loneliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is followed by an early dinner, giving the body enough time to finish digesting and before going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too close to bed has long been linked to digestive issues, poor sleep and higher glucose spikes—all of which accelerate the ageing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:47:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQS2NzMEhJT3JHRndMQVlVUEEtUHp1ODczd19BTFlEYzY4ZlRVai1fZzVjX2UtNlBQb1ZDVzNac0IxRnhHR2xvb05SZ0JmX1lWekhFbFprR2xlWEMtX1NaRS1SUEpueWNXWDUwUDUxQzEwZGNlUnZKTlVqWFlpVGgzanhqSzJYam5WRklKbnZzTmjSAZYBQVVfeXFMUFNPbFI2MmgyNVlLSGxMdkxKdzJaNzNvcHhyNEVWUWRmcTAxZWxoR3RucUJZQW1HbmR5S1Y0dmUtU214NlNJMWpKcU5GZGd1UjQ5a2JPWkk4S1lFS2s4XzFoREJJUGZSdElTVmp3blNFMzRmb29ZOHBJSzlwYlJsZFFzZkxyTVBmSFBnOXhwVnlTMGtPaEN3</guid></item><item><title>如果您剃发、剪发或拔发，您的头发会发生什么-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/16/cutting-shaving-plucking-waxing-hair-growth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JMRLLMVJJJBTFL3GN4EBUEU22M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Does cutting or shaving hair make it grow back faster, darker or thicker?

&lt;div class="wp-block-cgb-lede"&gt;&lt;p class="lede-content hide"&gt;The advisory committee makes recommendations to the CDC on what vaccines the American public should take each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday named a Maui children’s physician who used unapproved drugs to treat Covid to serve on a powerful federal advisory panel on vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and pastor at Calvary Chapel South Maui, provided the livestock drug ivermectin and the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat the coronavirus during free house calls for Maui residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and four others named Monday join the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at a fraught moment in public health. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;fired all 17 sitting members of the panel&lt;/a&gt; that makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how vaccines should be used, saying that a clean sweep is necessary to restore public trust in vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the health secretary’s picks have already been contentious, however. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Robert Malone has been a vocal critic of Covid mRNA vaccines, blaming &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;two deaths of unvaccinated children in the Texas measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; on “medical mismanagement” without citing any evidence. He and Milhoan are among several anti-vaccine voices on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

(Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2021)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hawaiʻi, Milhoan’s embrace of discredited Covid treatments has made him &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/from-masks-to-vaccines-how-churches-have-power-over-public-health/"&gt;a controversial figure&lt;/a&gt;. He did not require masks or social distancing at Calvary Church of South Maui during the height of the pandemic, saying the church’s mission must continue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His use of discredited drugs during the pandemic was &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/doh-statement-on-the-pono-coalition-for-informed-consent/"&gt;widely condemned&lt;/a&gt; by Hawaiʻi officials, including former Gov. David Ige and former Hawaiʻi Health Director Libby Char.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/that-is-not-aloha-dr-lorrin-pang-is-pushing-back-against-his-critics/"&gt;Dr. Lorrin Pang&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s top medical adviser for Maui County, co-founded The Pono Coalition for Informed Consent, a website that called the Covid vaccines experimental and advocated instead for the use of unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiʻi Medical Board filed a complaint against him and Pang in August 2021 that, if substantiated, could have led to the loss of their state medical licenses. The state Regulated Industries Complaints Office dropped the complaint eight months later and took &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/state-drops-complaint-against-top-maui-medical-professional/"&gt;no disciplinary actions&lt;/a&gt; against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, Milhoan participated in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/d41d8cd9/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-leads-a-hearing-on-injuries-caused-by-covid-19-vaccin/6998956623513668/"&gt;a 2024 hearing&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, a Republican from Georgia, on Covid-19 vaccine injuries. During the hearing he &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/discredited-covid-19-vaccine-skeptics-130000894.html"&gt;advocated against vaccinating children&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the Covid vaccine had triggered cardiac problems in some pediatric patients he’d seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan and his wife operate &lt;a href="https://forheartsandsouls.org/who-we-are/"&gt;For Hearts and Souls&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit Christian medical ministry which provides medical care to children around the world with cardiac problems who lack access to treatment. He is a senior fellow at the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a group formed in March 2020 that advocates for dubious Covid treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has an active medical license in Hawai‘i, Montana, Wyoming and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reached by email Monday, Milhoan, who traveled to Washington, D.C., for his appointment, declined to be interviewed. He cited a request made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that all interviews be coordinated by the agency’s media team. The HHS media team did not respond to phone and email requests for comment or for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revisiting-guidance"&gt;Revisiting Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly configured panel is being convened as public trust in routine vaccines continues to decline nationally. One in six parents reported &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/"&gt;delaying or skipping at least one vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, other than Covid or the flu, for their children in a new KFF-Washington Post survey published Monday of more than 2,700 parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, when the panel is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;discuss vaccines against Covid&lt;/a&gt;, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, there are new Covid formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested they wanted to revisit the guidance on Hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. The virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds. Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problems with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other new panel members announced on Monday, bringing the total to 12, are Dr. Catherine Stein, an epidemiologist and professor at Case Western Reserve University; Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Louisiana; Dr. Hillary Blackburn, director of medication access and affordability at AscensionRx; and Dr. Raymond Pollak, an organ transplant surgeon with a background in immunology. &lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by a parasite carried by insects called kissing bugs, should now be considered endemic in the United States, experts say – and without recognition that it’s a constant presence in some parts of the country, more people will suffer unnecessarily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60002336nkea8aeh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; on the topic was published last week in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the authors say they hope that growing global attention on the new paper means Chagas could finally get the surveillance, prevention and testing efforts and research funding it deserves in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60004336nqxxclofm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting forever; all of us Chagas people have been waiting for people to recognize this disease is in our communities,” said Dr. Norman Beatty, coauthor of the report and &lt;a href="https://id.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/beatty-norman/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Florida College of Medicine’s Division of Infectious Diseases &amp;amp; Global Medicine who has studied Chagas for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60005336n240rslsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers Chagas a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;neglected tropical disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;the Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says it is endemic – with a constant presence or usual prevalence – in 21 other countries in the Americas, not including the United States. Chagas is one of the leading causes of heart disease in Latin America, and it causes more disability than other insect-borne infections, even more than malaria and Zika, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-019-0170-1#ref-CR1" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60006336nucdkiiww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas largely spreads when triatomine bugs, commonly known as kissing bugs, bite a human while they’re sleeping. The bug defecates in that bite or on a person’s face, and the person unwittingly wipes the feces into their eyes, nose or mouth. The feces can carry a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflo942g00053b6qyfuto9p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;can also spread&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated food or blood, organ transplants and pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60007336nnwrt5n09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms can include fever, body aches, headaches, rash, vomiting and tiredness. They may last weeks or even months after initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000a336n46075m90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, about 20% to 30% of people who’ve been infected develop more serious problems like long-term digestive and nervous system conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599#:~:text=Background:,suspected%20or%20confirmed%20Chagas%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60008336n3bzcz2jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s caught early, the disease can be cured with benznidazole or nifurtimox, medicines that kill the parasite. But the drugs become less effective the longer a person has been infected, and most people remain unaware of the disease. Many doctors don’t think to look for it in patients in the US, the new report noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflobcrr000a3b6qldijporx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, some people who are infected find out some time later, when they donate blood, since the US has been testing its blood supply for Chagas since 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000b336n9zq95kqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Surveillance is limited, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 280,000 people in the US have Chagas at any given time. It’s unclear how many have the more serious form of the disease or how many deaths are caused by Chagas each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000c336n8tl8gjl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have found kissing bugs in 32 states, the new report says. The blood-sucking insect mostly lives in warmer Southern states, but with climate change causing more bug-friendly temperatures, there’s a good chance they have spread farther.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000d336n8wqdxrky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientistst have identified at least 17 states with infected mammals, including Virginia opossums, raccoons, banded armadillos, striped skunks, coyotes and wood rats, according to the latest report. Veterinarians have seen infections in zoo animals and pets, including cats, dogs and a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000e336nte0v7otw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have reported Chagas cases in humans in eight states: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. There are probably more cases, the new report says, but doctors are not required to report Chagas infections in most states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsotx0000336nf9fpwfl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It would be “momentous” for Chagas to be declared endemic in the US, said Dr. Mario J. Grijalva, director of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ohio University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflskphj000q3b6qkmgkpfnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you consider it a problem that belongs to others, it’s not important. But when it’s a problem affecting people here, the recognition that it is an endemic disease in the United States is a game-changer, at least in terms of the public policy possibilities and the awareness that is required to properly address this complicated issue,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfls921l001i336nhzfm5nrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grijalva knows firsthand what a difference it can make to have awareness and a concerted health campaign. He spent his recent sabbatical riding a motorcycle across Latin America to spread the word about the condition, after making a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwYpF14vNs" target="_blank"&gt;similar motorcycle trip in the US&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In countries like Ecuador and Peru where Chagas is endemic but there is no concerted government efforts to manage it, most people were unaware of the disease, Grijalva said. But in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina - all countries with robust health and public awareness campaigns – the people he spoke with knew about Chagas, and many cases were being well-managed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsoet4000x3b6q7rwyeqhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of effort to fight this in those countries,” Grijalva said. “It can be fought, and there are a lot of successes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000f336n1rdp5igo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty hopes broader recognition of Chagas in the US will prompt officials to step up surveillance efforts like what he’s seen in some other countries. He also hopes health care providers learn to recognize cases sooner and wishes the US would work to protect people from kissing bugs like it does mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000g336njp70r42p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have mosquito control programs around the country, but we’re essentially doing nothing about kissing bugs,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000h336ng94jpj19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, he said, people aiming to keep the insects away can better seal their homes, use window screens and spray for bugs. However, he has not found any particular spray specifically approved to target kissing bugs in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000i336nrqasd7bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And in Florida, where he works and where about 30% of kissing bugs seem to be positive for the parasites, Beatty said, people will often send him bug photos or even drop the insects off at his hospital to be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000j336nx5zhim7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re scared,” he said – and they have a right to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000k336np8egbvwy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty said he tries to help his community as best he can. “There’s not another doctor around here walking around with bugs in their pockets,” he said. But with more awareness, he hopes others will step up as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000l336nux2vmww4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m just one person,” Beatty said. “It’s a small team, and we have limited resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying, until age 4, the hepatitis B vaccine that's currently given to newborns, according to two former senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life," said Demetre Daskalakis, the former director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "Apparently this is a priority of the Secretary's."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vote is expected to take place Thursday during the next meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ" target="_blank"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for September 18-19 at a CDC office in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, the CDC has advised that infants get the first of three shots of the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/VaccChildren.htm" target="_blank"&gt;at birth&lt;/a&gt;. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Between 1990 and 2022, case rates plummeted 99 percent among people age 19 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians warn that waiting until age 4 to begin vaccination opens the door to more children contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Age four makes zero sense," said pediatrician &lt;a href="https://aapca1.org/profile/eric-ball-md-district-ix-vice-chair/" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Ball&lt;/a&gt;, who practices in Orange County, California. "We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It's really the best way to keep our entire population healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;will also discuss&lt;/a&gt; and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine, and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, because ACIP's recommendations generally determine whether insurance plans and federal programs pay for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is an atypical situation. There's been no work group to discuss it," Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second former official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an email, a Health and Human Services spokesman, Andrew Nixon, wrote, "ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public Sunday, only a few days before the meetings are scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting in June, chairman Martin Kulldorff, one of the new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88955" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;public health measures&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use," Kulldorff said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The infection requires direct exposure to infected bodily fluids like blood and semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Protection From Birth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=transaction#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20acute%20disease,HBV%20infection%20must%20be%20expanded." target="_blank"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/stories/hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccination-in-africa.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20Mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission%20is%20the,hours%20of%20life%2C%20can%20prevent%20mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission." target="_blank"&gt;24 hours of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While parents may opt out of the shots, many daycare centers and school districts &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/laws/hepb-ccsch-rqt-map-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;require proof&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The prospect of altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am goddamn frustrated," said &lt;a href="https://wendylo.com/#about" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Lo&lt;/a&gt;, 52, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. Lo says she has probably had hepatitis B since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has impacted almost every aspect of her life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented," she said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo only learned she had the disease due to a routine screening in order to study abroad in college as a young adult. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo credits the vaccines with protecting all the members of her close family from infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I shared with my partner, 'if you get vaccinated, we can be together,'" she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, "so I'm grateful for that," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=Although%20HBV%20can%20be%20found,breastfeeding%2C%20or%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;do not know&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;few or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S. Asians and Pacific Islanders, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.6.htm" target="_blank"&gt;followed by&lt;/a&gt; Black people, have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the lifetime consequences, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/perinatal-hepb/downloads/HepB-Provider-tipsheet-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren't available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Now I'm in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it's life-saving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Thirty Years of Universal Vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on so-called "high-risk" adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the healthcare practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we've learned so much more," said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/person/william-schaffner-md/" target="_blank"&gt;former voting member &lt;/a&gt;of ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime – newborns. The virus is often&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pop-who-is-at-risk" target="_blank"&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We may soon hear 'let's just do a blood test on all pregnant women.' We tried that. That doesn't work perfectly either," Shaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some doctors didn't test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative, while others acquired hepatitis B later in pregnancy, after they had already been tested. In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison member to the ACIP group that voted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommend universal vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We want no babies infected. Therefore, we'll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 in those 19 years old and under in the U.S., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injected drug use or multiple sexual partners, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/hepatitis-b-vaccine#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20catch%20hepatitis,through%20air%2C%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; caution that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations, especially among young children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus can survive for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm#:~:text=Introduction,is%20provided%20(Box%201)." target="_blank"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a &lt;a href="https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school desk or playground equipment&lt;/a&gt; can pose a risk. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children who are not considered "high risk" can still be exposed in everyday environments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Future Access Uncertain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shot if given before the new recommended age. That could leave parents to pay out of pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Children who get immunizations through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner is still a liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He intends to speak up if he can, because he's worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We'll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We'll see transmission into the next generation," he said. "And the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced in partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR Health Correspondent Will Stone contributed to this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's Disease affects around a million people in the United States, and that number is on the rise, in part because our population is getting older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/clinicians/claire-henchcliffe-1730276825" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Claire Henchcliffe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the chair of neurology at the University of California, Irvine. She's one of the scientists at the forefront of Parkinson's research, and she says Parkinson's is the fastest growing out of the neurodegenerative disorders she deals with as a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very concerning that it's growing so quickly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's is a progressive disorder that causes difficulty with movement. But Henchcliffe says people also deal with symptoms that are harder to see, like memory, cognition problems, or onset of depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;People are typically diagnosed around age 50 or 60, but the process of developing Parkinson's begins in the brain much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It may start 10, 15, 20 years before we ever pick up a tremor or ever see someone slow down," Henchcliffe says. "Sense of smell can alter, sleep can change … That's when the Parkinson's process in the brain has started. It's kicked off. But we don't have the wherewithal yet to be able to diagnose that process for sure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Henchcliffe is one of many brain scientists working toward new treatment options for Parkinson's, including recent discoveries about the potential use of stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Science correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100615/jon-hamilton" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jon Hamilton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dives into this research — and even a future where scientists can prevent the disease altogether — on the show with Henchcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more on the future of brain science?

&lt;p&gt;BAVINA SOOKDEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, thousands of families in Trinidad and Tobago are affected by sudden strokes, heart attacks and amputations – events often linked to one hidden culprit: vascular disease. According to Prof Vijay Naraynsingh, distinguished surgeon and researcher who works at Medical Associates Hospital, St Joseph, this condition quietly threatens lives across TT, but with awareness and prevention, many cases can be avoided. He spoke to the Newsday as the world observes Vascular Disease Awareness Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naraynsingh explained that vascular really means vessels. “We’re talking about blood vessels or lymphatic vessels – arteries, veins and lymphatics. Lymphatics are the ones that carry fluid, but really arterial and venous are the two more common conditions. All the arteries and the veins will be part of our vascular speciality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a career spanning over 45 years, the doctor, likens the vascular system to a household piping network: “The heart pumps blood like water into your house. If there’s a blockage in a pipe, it affects where it’s going. A blockage to the brain can cause a stroke, to the heart – a heart attack, to the kidneys – kidney failure and to the legs – gangrene and amputation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to veins, varicose veins are the most common issue. However, as Naraynsingh pointed out, it’s the arteries that are far more dangerous. He noted that in TT, the leading cause of death is heart disease, followed closely by strokes – both of which are vascular conditions. “In the system of pipes, the pipes go bad with age. They can go bad with other things too (like smoking and with cholesterol issues) but by and large, the pipes degenerate with age,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551210817264-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while these age-related changes are expected, lifestyle factors are accelerating the problem, making vascular disease an increasingly urgent concern. Naraynsingh warned that cases of vascular disease are on the rise, also driven by increasing rates of diabetes, obesity and hypertension – and worryingly, it is now appearing more often in younger people as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1178430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1178430" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1178430" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24386887-893x1024.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1178430" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;-&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the surgeon, vascular disease is rarely confined to one area. “When you have vascular disease, it’s a multi-system disorder. You cannot have one pipe rusting and assume the rest are fine. If someone has heart disease, chances are they also have issues in their brain, kidneys, or limbs. It’s a generalised disease that just manifests in a particular organ at that time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naraynsingh further explained that when a patient goes to him with a stroke, he does not treat the stroke in isolation. After addressing the immediate issue, he also investigates for heart disease, kidney disease, lower limb disease and signs of generalised vascular disease, with the aim of controlling the condition across the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasising that prevention is the best defence, Naraynsingh advised, “The easiest thing is to do your regular checks – blood pressure, sugar, lipids. When we see abnormalities even before symptoms appear, we can start preventative measures like losing weight, exercising (which everyone should be doing), stopping smoking and using medication if necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening, he added, is especially critical for those at higher risk. “If you are diabetic, you need fairly extensive checks – your heart, eyes, kidneys, carotids and lower limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for treatment, it varies depending on how the disease presents. “If the problem is diabetes or hypertension, we aim for tight control,” Naraynsingh explained. “If there’s vessel narrowing, we can use blood thinners like aspirin or Plavix, or medication to lower cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical options have also evolved. Naraynsingh explained that surgery for vascular disease varies depending on severity and location. In the heart, the most common procedure is bypass surgery, but milder cases may only require angioplasty and stenting. In angioplasty, a wire is inserted into the narrowed vessel, and a balloon is inflated to widen it. If the vessel collapses again, a stent – “like a collapsible wire fence” – is placed to keep it open. Bypass surgery, on the other hand, leaves the blocked vessel in place but creates a new pathway, like laying a fresh pipe alongside a blocked one and joining it above and below the obstruction. For patients with strokes or reduced blood flow to the brain, surgeons often operate on the carotid artery in the neck, removing the plaque in a procedure called endarterectomy. For lower limb disease, both bypass surgery and angioplasty with stenting are common. Ultimately, he stressed, the technique depends on the extent, location, and number of blockages, since ‘a pipe doesn’t rust in just one spot – it rusts in many.’ There is no one-size-fits-all treatment; it must be tailored to each patient’s pattern of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest barriers, Naraynsingh believes, is the lack of timely access to advanced care. “People don’t understand the value of what I call ‘snatch and run,’” he explained. If someone has chest pain, families often wait on an ambulance – which can take half an hour, an hour, or even longer – when in reality, no hospital in Trinidad is more than 20 to 30 minutes away. “While you’re waiting on the ambulance, the patient could die” he stressed. The most important thing is getting them to the hospital quickly. The bigger issue, he added, is what happens after arrival. In the entire public system, there is only one Cath lab (a hospital procedure room with specialised imaging equipment used to diagnose and treat heart conditions), located at Mount Hope and it is not a 24-hour service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551381418315-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1178432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1178432" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1178432" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24386885.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1178432" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof Vijay Naraynsingh -&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, we should have at least two or three major hospitals equipped with trained personnel available 24/7 to handle emergencies the moment a patient arrives, because every minute lost means the heart muscle is dying.” The same urgency applies to strokes, where patients must receive treatment within four hours before brain tissue is irreversibly damaged. “Time is brain,” he stressed. “If you arrive too late, even if the clot is removed, the brain cells are already dead.” He noted that private Cath labs exist, but they remain prohibitively expensive for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His message during Vascular Disease Awareness Month is to “Get screened and do your regular checks. For diabetics especially, be vigilant and do extensive checks. We have not decreased our amputation rate in Trinidad and Tobago yet, and we need to work aggressively on that but it requires a multi-tiered approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At both a personal and national level, the fight against vascular disease comes down to prevention, awareness and timely care. “We really need to increase public awareness of how urgent the matter is. When somebody gets a heart attack or a stroke, you get them to an institution fast. Time is brain, time is heart,” the doctor warned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23205080.jpg" alt="President of the TT Association of Psychologists, Kelly McFarlane. FILE PHOTO - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;President of the TT Association of Psychologists, Kelly McFarlane. FILE PHOTO - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As World Suicide Prevention Day was observed on September 10, TT finds itself facing a stark reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory Data Repository, this country ranks fifth in the Caribbean for suicide mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this troubling backdrop, president of the TT Association of Psychologists (TTAP), Kelly Mc Farlane, is sounding the alarm, especially for workers recently affected by sweeping job cuts in programmes like Cepep, the reforestation programme, and URP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, she warns, are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges stemming from financial insecurity, identity disruption, and daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane outlined several evidence-based strategies proven to help individuals cope with sudden unemployment and its psychological toll. She emphasised the importance of regulating the nervous system and maintaining a sense of control, starting with the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most effective tools is slow, diaphragmatic breathing, done two to three times a day,” she said. “It’s been shown to reduce cortisol levels and lower blood pressure, both of which spike under chronic stress. It trains the body to respond differently to stress over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem with breathing techniques, Mc Farlane recommends grounding practices and maintaining structured daily routines. Even without formal employment, she noted, people can benefit from creating consistency around meals, exercise, reading, job searches, or caring for family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This structure helps support your circadian rhythm, which plays a critical role in regulating mood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another essential technique Mc Farlane highlighted is behavioural activation, which focuses on intentionally scheduling small, purposeful tasks to help re-engage with life after a setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing a job certainly qualifies as a major life disruption. Even minor activities, like cleaning a room or applying for one job, can provide a sense of purpose and help guard against depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most powerful buffer against emotional decline, she said, is human connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social support is absolutely essential. We are wired to connect. Everyone needs at least one trusted person they can talk to, whether it’s a friend, a relative, or a peer. Just having someone to speak with regularly helps buffer the stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mc Farlane, these connections do more than offer comfort. They reduce biological markers associated with depression. She says it is not just psychological: it’s physiological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Isolation worsens things, while connection heals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also encouraged the use of cognitive reframing, a psychological technique that helps people view distressing situations through a more constructive lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive reframing isn’t about pretending things are fine,” she explained. “It’s about acknowledging the reality but choosing a perspective that doesn’t add to your distress. That’s a powerful mental shift. You’re actively changing how your brain processes the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane said many affected workers live in the same communities and could benefit from peer support groups—informal spaces for shared listening, encouragement, and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These can be very effective. They don’t have to be formal or expensive. It could be a group that meets in someone’s home, at a community centre, or on Zoom. What matters is creating a safe space to talk and be heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She urged anyone feeling overwhelmed not to suffer in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms can vary, but they often include persistent sadness, withdrawal from activities, and changes in sleep or appetite. If you’re experiencing these, especially as a parent trying to hold it all together, please reach out.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ancient bones discovered in a cave in Vietnam could belong to one of the world's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shattered-skull-details-gruesome-final-moments-of-a-medieval-murder-victim"&gt;earliest known victims of homicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the bones and circumstances of his death suggests that the man, aged around 35 years at the time of his death, some 12,000 years ago, died at the hands of another human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, it would be the earliest known case of interpersonal violence in Southeast Asia, says a team led by archaeologist Christopher Stimpson of Oxford University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/south-american-mummies-were-brutally-murdered-ct-scans-reveal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South American Mummies Were Brutally Murdered, CT Scans Reveal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-174262" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed-370x415.jpg 370w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed-600x674.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The skull was in pieces and had to be put back together like a puzzle. (C. M. Stimpson)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bones were excavated in the archaeological site in a cave called Thung Binh 1 in the Tràng An Landscape Complex World Heritage Site between December 2017 and April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his skull was crushed in his grave – damage that occurred post mortem – the man, named TBH1, appeared to have been local to the region and died in good health, initial analysis of his bones suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since people in good health don't generally tend to drop dead, this was a little curious. Then the mystery deepened. An examination of the man's neck revealed two surprising things: first, he had a cervical rib, an extra rib seen in around one percent of people; and second, there was a quartz point in the sediment in which the man was interred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On closer inspection, the researchers found that the quartz point had been deliberately worked, probably as a projectile. Also, it wasn't local stone by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't match any other stone tools from Thung Binh 1 or nearby sites, raising questions about who made it and where it came from," &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/ancient-cave-discovery-points-to-southeast-asia-s-earliest-human.html"&gt;says archaeologist Benjamin Utting&lt;/a&gt; of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at the bones, the researchers were able to piece together a likely sequence of events. One of the man's cervical ribs showed signs of fracture, but also infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimpson and his colleague believe the man was struck by a stone-tipped projectile in his neck, where it lodged after damaging his rib. Infection then set into the wound, and the man sickened and died several days to weeks after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174265" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-174265" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture-600x314.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174265" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The fracture trauma from multiple angles (left) and the stone point (right).

People buried in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Sahaba"&gt;Jebel Sahaba cemetery&lt;/a&gt; dating back 13,000 years show heavy signs of interpersonal damage, for example. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-famous-iceman-tzi-is-not-who-we-thought-he-was"&gt;Ötzi the Iceman&lt;/a&gt; was murdered in the Italian Alps &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-025-03510-5"&gt;5,300 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep may enhance the brain’s ability to remove harmful waste. Poor or disrupted sleep could raise dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain possesses its own system for removing waste, known as the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00031.2020"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which is believed to become more active during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sleep is disrupted, this cleaning process may be impaired, slowing the removal of toxins and other waste products from the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb8739"&gt;Researchers suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the accumulation of such toxins due to inadequate sleep could contribute to a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains about how exactly the glymphatic system functions in humans, as much of the current evidence comes from mouse studies. Still, these findings raise the possibility that better sleep could enhance the clearance of harmful substances in the brain and thereby lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what researchers currently understand about this developing field of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why waste matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells in the body generate waste. Outside the brain, the lymphatic system removes this material by carrying it from the spaces between cells into the bloodstream through a network of vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain, however, lacks its own lymphatic vessels. Until about 12 years ago, scientists did not know how the brain handled its waste. That changed with the discovery of the glymphatic system, which was described as a mechanism that “&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/46/18190"&gt;flushes out&lt;/a&gt;” toxins from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cerebrospinal-fluid"&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds both the brain and spinal cord, plays a central role in this process. The fluid flows around blood vessels in the brain, then moves into the spaces between brain cells, where it collects waste before draining out through large veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice later demonstrated that the glymphatic system becomes most active &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1241224"&gt;during sleep&lt;/a&gt;, with waste removal markedly increased at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the substances cleared through this system is amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. When Aβ builds up in the brain, it can form plaques. Alongside tangles of another protein, tau, found in neurons, these plaques are key features of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-difference-between-alzheimers-and-dementia-225271"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans and mice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1180962"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that levels of Aβ detected in the cerebrospinal fluid increase when awake and then rapidly fall during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01638-y"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; (in mice) showed pretty much the opposite – suggesting the glymphatic system is more active in the daytime. Researchers are debating what might explain the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we still have some way to go before we can say exactly how the glymphatic system works – in mice or humans – to clear the brain of toxins that might otherwise increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Does this happen in humans too?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know sleeping well is good for us, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.55"&gt;particularly our brain health&lt;/a&gt;. We are all aware of the short-term effects of sleep deprivation on our brain’s ability to function, and we know &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00054.2024"&gt;sleep helps improve memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, a single night of complete sleep deprivation in healthy adults &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1721694115"&gt;increased the amount&lt;/a&gt; of Aβ in the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. This suggests sleep can influence the clearance of Aβ from the human brain, supporting the idea that the human glymphatic system is more active while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also raises the question of whether good sleep might lead to better clearance of toxins such as Aβ from the brain, and so be a potential target to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How about sleep apnea or insomnia?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is less clear is what long-term disrupted sleep, for instance if someone has a sleep disorder, means for the body’s ability to clear Aβ from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; is a common sleep disorder when someone’s breathing stops multiple times as they sleep. This can lead to chronic (long-term) sleep deprivation, and reduced oxygen in the blood. Both may be implicated in the accumulation of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has also been linked with an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13589"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. And we now know that after people are treated for sleep apnea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx011"&gt;more Aβ is cleared from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/insomnia-2"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt; is when someone has difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. When this happens in the long term, there’s also an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318814"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, we don’t know the effect of treating insomnia on toxins associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, it’s still too early to say for sure that treating a sleep disorder reduces your risk of dementia because of reduced levels of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these studies suggest enough good quality sleep is important for a healthy brain, and in particular for clearing toxins associated with dementia from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still don’t know if &lt;em&gt;treating&lt;/em&gt; a sleep disorder or improving sleep more broadly affects the brain’s ability to remove toxins, and whether this reduces the risk of dementia. It’s an area researchers, including us, are actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we’re investigating the &lt;a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/understanding-brain-cleaning-in-obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;concentration of Aβ and tau measured in blood&lt;/a&gt; across the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in people with sleep apnea, on and off treatment, to better understand how sleep apnea affects brain cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into the potential for treating insomnia with a class of drugs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44323-025-00025-5"&gt;known as orexin receptor antagonists&lt;/a&gt; to see if this affects the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06823752"&gt;clearance of Aβ from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you’re concerned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an emerging field and we don’t yet have all the answers about the link between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-dangerous-is-insomnia-how-fear-of-what-its-doing-to-your-body-can-wreck-your-sleep-212248"&gt;disrupted sleep and dementia&lt;/a&gt;, or whether better sleep can boost the glymphatic system and so prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are concerned about your sleep or cognition, please see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep-brain structures like the basal ganglia or the thalamus wield major influence on our behavior. If something goes awry, dysregulation in the deep brain may trigger neurological conditions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;like Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the clear importance of these structures, our knowledge about them remains limited by their location, making&lt;span&gt; them difficult to study and treat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers unveil a device that might offer an alternative to invasive procedures. Featuring a novel ultrasound helmet, it not only modulates deep-brain circuits without surgery, but reportedly can do so with unrivaled precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultrasound-can-probe-deep-into-the-brain-to-relieve-pain"&gt;Ultrasound Can Probe Deep Into The Brain to Relieve Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology represents a leap forward in our ability to study and influence the deep brain, says senior author Bradley Treeby, a biomedical engineer at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This advance opens up opportunities for both neuroscience research and clinical treatment. For the first time, scientists can non-invasively study causal relationships in deep-brain circuits that were previously only accessible through surgery," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and essential tremor," he &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, "offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system builds on existing methods like transcranial ultrasound stimulation and MRI-guided focused ultrasound, but it's designed to address limitations of each, such as the former's low focal precision and the latter's need for stabilizing skull screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new helmet can target areas in the brain 1,000 times smaller than conventional ultrasound devices can, and 30 times smaller than similar technologies that specifically target deeper areas of the brain, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does this using an array of 256 elements configured on the helmet's interior, which emit focused ultrasound beams at specific areas of the wearer's brain to raise or reduce neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg" alt="breakdown of ultrasound helmet" class="wp-image-174338 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A schematic of the ultrasound helmet.

Functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans showed a simultaneous surge of activity in the visual cortex, suggesting the LGN was successfully hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This real-time monitoring capability is an important feature, says first author Eleanor Martin, a physicist and engineer in UCL's Biomedical Ultrasound Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We designed the system to be compatible with simultaneous fMRI, enabling us to monitor the effects of stimulation in real time," she &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up exciting possibilities for closed-loop neuromodulation and personalised therapies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another experiment demonstrated the durability of the helmet's effects, with changes in visual cortex activity continuing for 40 minutes after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects reported no conscious perception of any visual changes during these tests, the researchers note, yet  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless revealed significant and persistent shifts in neural activity at the intended locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to precisely modulate deep-brain structures without surgery represents a paradigm shift in neuroscience, offering a safe, reversible, and repeatable method for both understanding brain function and developing targeted therapies," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smart-brain-implants-can-now-adapt-to-optimize-parkinsons-treatment"&gt;Smart Brain Implants Can Now Adapt to Optimize Parkinson's Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully explain what's happening in this process, the researchers point out, but these results already amount to a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such deft neuromodulation was previously impossible without invasive methods, and it offers new hope for patients with certain conditions, says co-author and clinical neuroscientist Ioana Grigoras from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are particularly excited about its potential clinical applications for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, where deep-brain regions are especially affected," Grigoras &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63020-1"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cyclists tend to do some pretty weird and wonderful things in the hope of improving performance. We’ll try any supplement or diet trend with even the faintest promise of improvement, we’ll tinker with and tweak our bikes until the cows come home, and we’ll try all sorts of strange tech in the hope of accessing even the most marginal of gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about shining a bunch of light through your skull and up your nose, into your brain, all in the hope of improving time trial performance? Yep, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-pbm"&gt;What is PBM?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might be able to tell from the name, photobiomodulation (or PBM) is a technique that involves shining light into the body in order to stimulate various effects. The light used is in the red to near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum – normally with wavelengths between 600 and 1,100 nm – and depending on what sort of tissue you point that light at, it can generate a range of different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point it at muscle tissue and it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/8/4/144?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;induce an increase in oxygen demand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which can ultimately lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-022-01714-y?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;improved performance in time-to-exhaustion tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Directing it at the muscles also seems to help with the repair of those muscles, due to a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajpmr/abstract/2014/12000/effects_of_low_level_laser_therapy_on_skeletal.7.aspx?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“reduction in the inflammatory process”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And it turns out that transcranial PBM – that is, firing those infrared lights through your skull and into your brain cells – can both &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/11/966?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enhance cognitive abilities in healthy brains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also has some potential when it comes to treating neurodegenerative conditions &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0278412&amp;amp;ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does it work exactly? To simplify a &lt;a href="https://soterixmedical.com/research/tpbm?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rather complex process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the absorption of infrared light within the brain cells seems to lead to increased blood flow in the brain, in addition to enhanced hemoglobin oxygenation (you might recall that hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues). These factors, in turn, lead to increased activation of the brain areas targeted by the PBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxygenation levels in the brain are also relevant if we’re talking about exercise performance. Various studies have shown that a &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00909.2014?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drop in cerebral oxygenation during high-intensity exercise is associated with exhaustion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that deoxygenation of the prefrontal cortex in particular seems to contribute to “the cessation of exercise” during controlled and self-paced efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if there’s a link between oxygenation levels in the brain and exercise performance, could it be that &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; oxygenation in the brain – via a technique like PBM – might help improve cycling performance?&lt;/p&gt;

Men are more likely to die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The paradox, revealed in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837792?resultClick=24#250506426" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of the country's latest cancer registry, tells a story at once simple and confounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Women account for just over half of all new cases, but men make up the majority of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;India appears to be an outlier. In 2022, for every 100,000 people worldwide, on average about 197 were diagnosed with cancer that year. Men fared worse, at 212, compared to 186 for women, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/global-cancer-data-by-country/page/2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;World Cancer Research Fund&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Nearly 20 million cancer cases were diagnosed globally in 2022 - about 10.3 million in men and 9.7 million in women. In the US, the estimated lifetime risk of cancer is nearly equal for men and women, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the most common cancers among women are breast, cervical, and ovarian. Breast and cervical cancers make up 40% of female cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While cervical cancer is largely linked to infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV), breast and ovarian cancers are often influenced by hormonal factors. Rising cases of these hormone-related cancers are also associated with lifestyle shifts - including later pregnancies, reduced breastfeeding, obesity, and sedentary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For men, oral, lung, and prostate cancers dominate. Tobacco drives 40% of preventable cancers, mainly oral and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So what is going on in India? Is it an earlier diagnosis for women? Are men's cancers more aggressive, or is it that habits such as smoking and chewing tobacco drag down their outcomes? Or does the answer lie in differences in access, awareness and treatment between genders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gautam Bose People wearing skeleton outfits take part in a rally encouraging others not to use tobacco products in Kolkata, India, on May 31, 2025.

Their cancers are more often tied to lifestyle - tobacco and alcohol drive lung and oral cancers, both aggressive and less responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Men are also less likely to go for preventive check-ups or seek medical help early. The result: higher mortality and poorer outcomes, even when incidence is lower than among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women's health has become a bigger focus in public health campaigns, and that's a double-edged sword. Greater awareness and screening mean more cancers are detected early. For men, the conversation rarely goes beyond tobacco and oral cancer," Ravi Mehrotra, a cancer specialist and head of the non-profit Centre for Health Innovation and Policy (CHIP) Foundation, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women, through reproductive health checks, are more likely to see a doctor at some stage. Many men, by contrast, may go their whole lives without ever seeing one," Dr Mehrotra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the real story emerges when the numbers are broken down: India's cancer burden is unevenly spread across regions, and across the types of cancer people face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Data from 43 registries show that 11 out of every 100 people in India run the risk of developing cancer at some point during their life. An estimated 1.56 million cases and 874,000 deaths are projected for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The hilly and relatively remote northeast region remains India's cancer hotspot, with Mizoram's Aizawl district recording lifetime risks twice the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Doctors say much of this is down to lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"For most cancers in the north-eastern state, I'm convinced lifestyle is the key factor. Tobacco use is rampant here - much higher than elsewhere," R Ravi Kannan, head of Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Assam, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In Barak Valley in Assam, it's mostly chewing tobacco; just 25km away in Mizoram, smoking dominates. Add to that alcohol, areca nuts, and even how meat is prepared. Food choices and preparation drive cancer risk. There's no special cancer-causing gene at play - hereditary cancers aren't more common here than in other parts of India," Dr Kannan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the pattern isn't confined to the northeast. Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir tops the charts for lung cancer in men, while southern Hyderabad city leads in breast cancer. Men in the capital, Delhi, are being diagnosed with all cancers put together at a higher rate than men in other regions, even after correcting for age differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Oral cancer is also rising: 14 population registries report increases among men and four among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images A woman sits beside Malsawm Puia, 28, who suffers from blood cancer, in Kale township on the India-Myanmar border, on April 17, 2024.

The disparities seen across Indian states mirror a global divide shaped by geography, income, and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In wealthy nations, one in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, but only one in 71 will die from it, according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In poorer countries, the picture is reversed: just one in 27 women will ever receive a diagnosis, yet as many as one in 48 will die of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women in lower Human Development Index (HDI) countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment," says Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then there are other differences. In the US, for example, native Americans face the highest cancer mortality, with kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancer deaths two to three times higher than whites; black people also have double the mortality of whites for prostate, stomach, and uterine cancers, according to American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the cancer burden is not just growing - it is becoming more complex. Registry data reflect a society in transition, where longevity, lifestyle, and environment are reshaping health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Yet amid this shifting landscape, many questions remain, underscoring the urgent need for targeted prevention, early detection, and lifestyle changes, including healthier diets and habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Follow BBC News India on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="youtube," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;YouTube,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:32:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5nZkxMcFRTdVp3aXE2OUNkV0JLMGVCV2ZZMEhzb2ZHaTZuS1J2aEp3aGxwV3JrMWt6aUZuV1ZzMnpSeHAzTkh5X2RUOVgzTmcwNWxBMGtTdS1WZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1UdjZyQXE2VGJsV2tHOFJiZXVNMnFfLWVBWWlRVGhoWjBoM2VZVXlxYWZ6bDR1VWpFalpyTWlQcmV2ejhmU0tDVUxRbEEtRk1Ia2U4eEFvM3RsMDB4N2lZ</guid></item><item><title>心理学研究人员确定了“极端主义倦怠”的渠道- PsyPost</title><link>http://www.psypost.org/psychology-researchers-identify-a-burnout-to-extremism-pipeline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Luigi Mangione was arrested for the alleged murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in December 2024, public reaction shocked observers. Far from universal condemnation, many people expressed support. This was especially true among younger people, with polls showing &lt;a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-poll-young-voters-diverge-from-majority-on-crypto-tiktok-and-ceo-assassination/"&gt;41% of young adults&lt;/a&gt; viewed the murder as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what leads the average person to justify extreme violence? &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000643"&gt;Our recently published research&lt;/a&gt;, in the special issue &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/vio/understanding-violent-extremism"&gt;“Understanding violent extremism”&lt;/a&gt; of the APA &lt;em&gt;Journal Psychology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;, locates the answer in one increasingly widespread phenomenon: workplace burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s &lt;a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; cites “corruption and greed” as a source of frustration, a sentiment that resonates widely amid growing dissatisfaction with modern work environments. &lt;a href="https://clinicalsocialwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cswhi_03_2024_02_butz_OPR_04.pdf"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that broader patterns of systemic frustration and perceived corruption are associated with burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, which took daily surveys from over 600 employees, suggests burnout may quietly fuel worrying attitudes – specifically, the potential justification of violent extremism – towards the perceived source of their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The burnout to extremism pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, employees made daily notes of their burnout symptoms, emotional states, and violent extremist attitudes. On days when employees felt more burnt out, they reported significantly more sympathy toward extremist ideas, such as justifying violence against perceived injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily grind of burnout produced negative feelings of fear, sadness, shame, and guilt. To alleviate these negative feelings – and regain a sense of purpose – some individuals appeared to find extremist ideologies more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon can be explained through the combined lens of three established psychological theories. The first is &lt;a href="https://oxfordre.com/criminology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-249"&gt;General Strain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that daily frustrations lead to violent extremism through the experience of negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315227979-4/burnout-existential-perspective-ayala-pines"&gt;existential model of burnout&lt;/a&gt;, which links burnout to a failed existential quest when meaningfulness in work disappears. Last is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000144"&gt;Significance Quest Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that when the sense of personal significance is eroded in people’s everyday lives, they might look elsewhere, including to radical beliefs, to restore meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, these ideas, particularly the existential and Significance Quest models, suggest that burnout reflects a failed search for meaning – one that may drive individuals toward violent extremism as a means of restoration. General Strain Theory further contributes by emphasising the emotional path involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why burnout matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not suggest that individuals experiencing burnout will inevitably engage in extremist violence. Rather, it demonstrates how everyday experiences of burnout can subtly shift individuals toward violent extremist attitudes, thereby normalising the acceptance of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is critical and is emphasised in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000062"&gt;two-pyramids model&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between radicalisation of opinion and radicalisation of action. While the link between the two may be weak, radicalisation of opinion alone can pose a &lt;a href="https://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/3807"&gt;serious threat to democracies and open societies&lt;/a&gt; by eroding social cohesion and fostering polarisation. For this reason, it warrants focused study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, workplace burnout is alarmingly common, affecting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.vanede.nl/media/2669/gallup-iii-employee-burnout.pdf"&gt;three in four employees&lt;/a&gt;. This means a huge portion of the workforce experiences the emotional strain capable of fuelling extremist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority will never resort to violence, a society that becomes increasingly tolerant of extremist attitudes risks normalising destructive behaviours and undermining both democratic values and workplace cohesion. Moreover, even if only a small minority ultimately engage in violence, the consequences can still be profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organisational support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings also reveal an effective form of protection: &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b6e9be0e81ee13424f7140685a689bd2d85d7d3c"&gt;perceived organisational support&lt;/a&gt;. Employees who felt that their organisations genuinely valued their contributions and cared about their wellbeing were less likely to gravitate toward extremist ideologies, even when experiencing burnout symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a critical caveat to this: organisational support is most effective at mitigating the harmful effects of burnout before negative emotions take hold. Once employees have crossed that emotional threshold, additional support alone has limited power to prevent the escalation toward violent extremist attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers therefore hold the key to addressing burnout before it escalates into something more serious. Organisations must proactively invest in burnout prevention, not merely as a health initiative, but as a vital strategy for preserving stability, both in the workplace and in society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace, ensuring employees feel recognised and valued, training managers to identify early signs of burnout and respond proactively, and establishing open, safe channels for employee feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about fairness don’t stop at the office door. Broader perceptions of injustice in society may also fuel extremist sympathies, especially when individuals are already mentally exhausted. For instance, efforts to pursue the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-luigi-mangione"&gt;death penalty against Mangione to serve President Trump’s political agenda&lt;/a&gt; may deepen perceptions of systemic unfairness, which will only exacerbate radical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more than just workplace exhaustion or disengagement. It signals a deeper and more dangerous existential vulnerability. A workplace that ignores employee burnout doesn’t just risk lower productivity – it creates a breeding ground for ideological radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both workplaces and societies confront a surge in extremist sentiment, including support for violent acts framed as resistance to corporate greed, it is crucial that we learn to recognise the underlying psychological triggers. Burnout is one of them, and employees don’t just need support to do their jobs better – they need it to maintain a sense of meaning, stability, and connection in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burnt-out mind will seek meaning wherever it can find it. If the workplace fails to offer that, extremist ideologies are often ready to fill the void, with consequences that reach far beyond the office walls.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Why so? Because the first meal of the day replenishes glucose levels, boosting energy and alertness after an overnight fast. It also kickstarts your metabolism, improves focus and memory, helps regulate blood sugar and appetite to prevent overeating later in the day, and provides essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, many people are aware of the fact that a nutritious breakfast contributes to better heart health and overall well-being, and encourages healthier eating habits. But did you know how important it is to consume breakfast on time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01035-x" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is shedding light on the surprising link between meal timings and longevity, suggesting that delaying breakfast is linked with a higher risk of death, along with other health issues such as fatigue, depression, poor sleep, and oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the saying now goes: How late you eat the first meal of the day might be just as important as what’s on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/early-breakfast-could-help-you-live-longer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; following nearly 3,000 adults aged 42-94 over more than 20 years, suggests that delaying breakfast is linked with a higher risk of death, along with other health issues such as fatigue, depression, poor sleep, and oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Mass General Brigham (Harvard-affiliated) and the University of Manchester analyzed data from 2,945 UK adults aged between 42 and 94, tracking them for about 22 years, to see how changes in the timing of breakfast and dinner relate to health and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Hassan Dashti (Massachusetts General Hospital) in collaboration with the University of Manchester, the research added fresh evidence to the growing field of chrononutrition – the idea that the timing of meals (not just what we eat) influences health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that as people grow older, meal times tend to drift later – both breakfast and dinner – and the overall eating window (time in a day during which people eat) becomes narrower. The most eye-opening result? For each extra hour breakfast was delayed, there was about an 8-11% higher risk of mortality (death from any cause) during the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, late breakfast times were linked with other health problems. Many participants who ate late also reported poorer sleep, fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, and worse oral health. Those are signs not just of bad habits but sometimes of under-recognized health issues. Genetic predisposition to “late chronotype” (natural inclination to stay up late and wake up later) was also associated with later breakfast times, suggesting some of the timing shift may be built in, or influenced by internal body clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="14175499" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="breakfast-timing" source="Orion"&gt;breakfast timing&lt;/keyword&gt; might matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about being an early bird and someone who chooses to stick to the clock a bit too religiously. There are several biological, lifestyle, and psychological reasons timing seems to make a difference, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Circadian rhythms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our body’s internal clock regulates many functions, like sleep, digestion, hormone release, and metabolism. When you delay eating relative to waking time, you may misalign your meals with optimal metabolic windows. That could reduce how well nutrients are processed and increase stress on systems (e.g., glucose regulation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep and energy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later breakfasts often go hand-in-hand with poorer sleep, fatigue, or disrupted routines. If you wake late or sleep badly, your body may already be under strain; so eating late might be more of an ‘effect’ than a ‘cause’ in some people. Also, delayed eating may reduce total energy/nutrient intake early in the day, which can affect metabolism and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Behavioral and functional implications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Older adults who have mobility issues, depression, dental problems, or fatigue may find it harder to prepare or access breakfast early, or may simply not feel hungry until later. These health challenges themselves are risk factors for mortality. Thus, breakfast time might be a marker rather than just a lever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you should do: &lt;keyword id="3045780" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="longevity-hacks" source="Orion"&gt;Longevity hacks&lt;/keyword&gt; and practical tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this insight to support better health (especially as you age), here are some simple, actionable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat breakfast earlier, close to when you wake up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to have breakfast within one to two hours after waking. If you wake at 6-7 AM, aim for breakfast by 8-9 AM rather than delaying until late morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintain consistent mealtimes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like sleep, being regular with when you eat helps your body expect food, regulate hormones, digestion, and energy levels. A schedule like breakfast around 7-9 AM, lunch around noon, dinner before 6-8 PM can help anchor your day. Missing or delaying meals often disrupts the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prioritize breakfast quality:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What you eat matters. A protein-rich, fiber-full breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar, supports digestion, and gives staying power. Think eggs + veggies, oatmeal with nuts/fruit, yogurt with seeds, whole grain toast + protein. Skipping or having sugary breakfast items may give quick energy but less sustained benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Look after sleep and wake patterns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since late chronotype, poor sleep, or delayed wake times are associated with eating late, improving sleep hygiene can help. Going to bed earlier, maintaining consistent wake-up times, and limiting exposure to screens before bed – all of these help reset internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor health signs and routines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you notice fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, oral health problems, or gradually delaying meals, these may be early warning signs worth discussing with your healthcare provider. Mealtime shifts may be easier to track than many other health markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating dinner too late or snacking heavily late in the evening can further skew your eating window and may compound the negative effects of a late breakfast. Light dinners, earlier evenings, and minimizing snacking can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNbzRSN1lGekk2eVdDbFREOTdPUUM3U0hwNlBFSVlQRTRXUlU1RTNzVW9qWk80a3JJOU1vd3AxM3pnZVg4RWhWbFVRZE4wNTVTYzg3akRPNWpITmNrU1o0cWRxN2U0SldqaFM4ai1tRGhOMkkxQllQdnFSUWNzTHJKOUhOVTIyQzR2QnQtMjZLdXhuYkZMdVpmMzAzd29xaVFkSlViVnFVZ2wzSGVlN0ZNSF91TlM0MDlzSlQ5WGJYWDR1TFUxM3FQeXo2NVNPbngzYmIyYTZjNUlSTzhzUXJITmEweHVjLWxIdmdmWjdvQkw2TmR0cHZzc0tiVzBvMEppSzJqc0pDQkNIeFZNNDk1T0VkOVh5aHY2YjRNeDdPV1paaE5TOG45M05SRnNYQzA</guid></item><item><title>权衡激素治疗更年期的益处和风险，因为FDA考虑删除“黑匣子”警告- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hrt-for-menopause-risks-benefits-fda-black-box-warnings/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hot flashes and sleepless nights are just some of the symptoms of perimenopause that have been disrupting Isabel Kallman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 53 years old, Kallman's hormones naturally started to decline, and the only medication available for her is menopause hormone therapy. For women experiencing the lead-up to menopause, hormone therapy treatment can involve using estrogen to help alleviate symptoms — but Kallman said she has been on the fence about it due to so-called "black box" labels on the medication, warning of the risk for stroke, blood clots, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kallman told CBS News she has been using "Fanny," a handheld fan that she keeps in her bag to help with some of her symptoms. But now she's considering hormone replacement as the Food and Drug Administration weighs removing some of the health warnings for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-breast-cancer-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;certain treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Rosser, who has been Kallman's doctor for five years, said she believes flawed research from more than 20 years ago overstated the risks of breast cancer because it focused on older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been overblown," Dr. Rosser, the director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian, told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shifting-world-of-womens-health/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the largest long-term study on women's health at the time, focused on older women who may not have started hormone replacement therapy until 10 or so years after going through &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menopause-grown-woman-talk-obgyn/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which raised safety concerns and led to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-menopause-slow-aging/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;longtime public misunderstanding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around hormone therapy, has since been found problematic in terms of how it was designed, according to Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. Now, health care professionals say factors such as age and dosing contribute to the safety of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that timing of treatment matters — a woman's age when she begins menopause hormone therapy, along with the delivery method, can substantially mitigate risks, Gounder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "an example of [how] science evolves," Gounder said of recent studies. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for a lot of perimenopausal symptoms, according to Gounder, who stressed that patients need to sit down with their doctors to determine what is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, treatment should start as close to the patient's final menstrual period and continue until about the age of 60, Dr. Rosser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to look at your risk and calculate your risk score," Dr. Rosser told Kallman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser has spent the past nine months working through the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-shows-hormone-therapy-can-benefit-womens-health-during-menopause/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and risks with her patient, who has a family history of breast cancer. While Kallman said she's still hesitant, she realizes hormone therapy may be her best chance at relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hoping that there is an opportunity for me to do it," Kallman told CBS News, adding that she hopes there's an option that will help her in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type of treatment is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Others include whole-body therapy like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pill-hot-flashes-women-menopause/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;pills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms such as hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As experts like Dr. Rosser continue to have conversations about how to present the treatment's pros and cons, an FDA-assembled panel has stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions. However, dozens of experts called for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that "removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk," The Associated Press reported. The group asked the FDA to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser said she sees it as a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a public health priority, and this is a sign that the FDA sees that," she told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

Nurrobi&lt;/a&gt; of the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine at &lt;a href="https://rspb.ihc.id/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pertamina Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Balikpapan, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-heart-health-and-longevity"&gt;Walking, heart health, and longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics did not cancel out the effect of walking pace. In a large study, researchers found that people who moved at a slower pace and also carried a high polygenic risk score faced the greatest likelihood of developing coronary disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of sluggish gait and unfavorable genetic profile produced the highest risk levels, showing that these two factors reinforce each other rather than replace one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the results confirmed that both &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;walking pace&lt;/a&gt; and genetic predisposition made independent contributions to risk prediction, which improves when walking pace is counted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights that lifestyle choices and inherited traits each matter when it comes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A UK Biobank &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/publications/walking-pace-improves-all-cause-and-cardiovascular-mortality-risk-prediction-a-uk-biobank-prognostic-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; reported that walking pace improves heart and other early mortality risk predictions beyond common measures, which helps clinicians sort risk better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-enough-for-real-life"&gt;How much is enough for real life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adults need at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity a week, such as 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week,” stated the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; guidelines. A 20 to 30 minute brisk walk most days gets you there without scheduling gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity means your breathing and heart rate are clearly up, but you can sustain the effort. Short on time, you can split walking into two 10 to 15 minute bouts and still check the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily routines are easier to keep than heroic goals. Pick a start time you can guard, like after lunch or before dinner, and make that slot non negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-pace-and-heart-health"&gt;Walking pace and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of randomized trials in healthy adults found that exercise training increases heart rate variability, a marker of flexible autonomic control that is linked with better cardiac outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is an aerobic stimulus that can nudge the heart and cardiovascular system in the right direction when practiced regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 review found that physical activity serves as an effective strategy for lowering cortisol levels. Reduced cortisol is associated with steadier mood, improved sleep, and less strain on the body systems that manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace also shapes how your blood vessels behave and helps your muscles pull more sugar and fat out of the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over weeks, those changes support healthier &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and cholesterol profiles, which is one reason walking shows up in prevention and recovery plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-risk-drop-is-plausible"&gt;Why the risk drop is plausible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dog-walking-improves-mobility-and-prevents-falls-in-older-adults/"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; taps large muscle groups in a rhythmic way, so circulation becomes more efficient with practice. That consistency trains the vessels to relax more easily and the heart to do the same job with less strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy use rises during and after the walk. Over time, that improves insulin sensitivity, and better insulin signaling supports stable blood sugar and less inflammatory activity tied to artery damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system matters too. When heart rate variability improves, it signals a stronger parasympathetic brake and a calmer response to daily stress, which lowers strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-pace-without-gadgets"&gt;How to pace without gadgets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use landmarks and a clock. If you are covering about a mile in 15 to 20 minutes and can hold that pace for your whole walk, you are in a useful zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your stride relaxed and your arms moving naturally. If you notice your pace slipping near the end, shorten the stride a bit and stay smooth rather than pushing into a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hills, stairs, and wind will change effort. Adjust your pace to keep effort steady across terrain, and let the tougher parts build fitness without forcing breathless bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-the-habit-when-life-is-messy"&gt;Keeping the habit when life is messy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anchor the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walk-20-minutes-daily-to-boost-your-brain-power/"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; to a daily cue, like finishing a morning coffee or closing your laptop at a set time. Habits tied to a cue survive busy days because you do not have to renegotiate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a bad weather plan. Indoor corridors, covered malls, or a safe loop near home keep the chain unbroken when the sky does not cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chest pain, unexplained shortness of breath, or dizziness during exertion, talk with a clinician before pushing pace. The goal is steady practice, not heroics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace and regularity are the levers you control. A brisk 20 to 30 minute walk most days can shift your odds in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Promoting a faster &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/squats-vs-walking-the-definitive-winner-for-reducing-blood-sugar/"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; pace as a daily activity may effectively mitigate the burden of CAD,” wrote Nurrobi. The signal appears consistently across different groups and remains strong even after accounting for genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11043612/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNVDN4dEU5OVNlWmVGUXpZR3Nrb1dlVWwtQXRBd1ZablFRaTBRZ3ZHN0ItRmZGbEFRU0sxNmRoeEt2aDNzR1dIWmJEaThlVnpMMUxMYlpNOWNraDdrMWc1RVpfMHUxZWx1ZC1udzZ2ZFBzUkVTMmlSU1B4QW1XaVhBSWJqczVzaXFCR1hvdDdmT3JVT2xUMUYtYWtzQ3IxVTZrVjlGRUhjR08</guid></item><item><title>特朗普的哈佛削减威胁到生物医学研究界的一个巨人：关于微小果蝇的数据库- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/trumps-harvard-cuts-threaten-giant-biomedical-research-community-datab-rcna230610</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcd112" class="body-graf"&gt;For more than a century, the humble fruit fly has paved the way for many critical scientific breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab564c" class="body-graf"&gt;This tiny insect helped researchers figure out that X-rays can cause genetic mutations. That genes are passed on from parent to child through &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1933/summary/" target="_blank"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;. That a &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2017/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;gene called period&lt;/a&gt; helps our bodies keep time — and that disruptions to that internal clock can lead to jet lag and increased risk for neurological and metabolic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39c94e" class="body-graf"&gt;Those discoveries, along with nearly 90,000 other studies, are part of a key online database called FlyBase that researchers routinely use to help them more quickly design new experiments. These tests explore the underlying causes of disease and could help with the development of new treatments. Science builds on prior insights, and a handy repository of past advances serves as kindling for future discoveries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02c461" class="body-graf"&gt;The website receives about 770,000 page views each month from scientists working around the world on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00180-2" target="_blank"&gt;developing personalized therapies&lt;/a&gt; for rare cancers, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/201/2/377/5930058" target="_blank"&gt;modeling human neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ahg.12554" target="_blank"&gt;screening drug candidates for conditions like Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fc638" class="body-graf"&gt;Now, that critical resource is on the brink of layoffs that endanger its future and ability to make research more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2c4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;This spring, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump administration, as part of its broader $2.2 billion funding cuts at Harvard University, rescinded a grant used to maintain FlyBase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae9a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I use FlyBase every single day. It’s so essential,” said Celeste Berg, a professor of genome sciences at the University of Washington, who is not part of the team that operates FlyBase. “What we know about human genes and how they function comes almost completely from model systems like drosophila.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d1035" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans share about 60% of our genes with fruit flies, also known by their scientific name &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea3100" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase’s now-uncertain future highlights just how interconnected and interdependent research efforts are and how the effects of funding cuts to one institution can ripple worldwide. More than 4,000 labs use FlyBase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60506" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard was receiving about $2 million a year in federal funding to maintain FlyBase, which was the vast majority of the website’s total operating budget. But the University of New Mexico, Indiana University and the University of Cambridge in England are partners that help Harvard manage FlyBase and are beneficiaries, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-453ac6" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is not just affecting Harvard,” said Brian Calvi, a professor of biology at Indiana University, who is part of the FlyBase management team. “The ripple effect is to the international biomedical research community.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c9dcbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences rescued FlyBase with interim funding, but that support will cease in October, according to Norbert Perrimon, a professor of developmental biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2643" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-unfreeze-nearly-22-billion-federal-g-rcna228926" target="_blank"&gt;judge earlier this month ordered the Trump administration to restore funding&lt;/a&gt; to Harvard researchers who lost grants, but money has not begun to flow to FlyBase, Perrimon said. The administration has promised to appeal the decision, which could halt the flow of funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-219b4a" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0dd35" class="body-graf"&gt;The Transmitter, a neuroscience news site, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.thetransmitter.org/community/harvard-university-lays-off-fly-database-team/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzhMChhdd$" target="_blank"&gt;first reported about layoffs at FlyBase&lt;/a&gt;. The Harvard Crimson reported about the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/9/9/flybase-funding/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzm6clJ6W$" target="_blank"&gt;decision not to continue with interim funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5294de" class="body-graf"&gt;Calvi said the FlyBase grant provided full or partial salary for eight people at Harvard, three at Indiana, five at Cambridge and one at the University of New Mexico. Both Indiana and Cambridge were able to secure funds to keep their portion of the program operating into next year. The New Mexico position ended in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7deafd" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase, which has been operating since 1992, has received federal support for more than three decades. It curates and summarizes research papers, organizes findings about particular genes, and catalogs information about fruit flies that have been modified genetically to tease apart how certain genes guide normal development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-817034" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruit flies are among the most important animal models for biomedical research because scientists have been able to map their genomes and brains. They’re also relatively easy and cheap to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-277cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Berg, the genome sciences professor and avid FlyBase user, studies human development and how cells form organs. FlyBase allows her to search and identify genes of interest for experiments. She then tests how changing the expression of those genes affects the arrangement of cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4520d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Every year, thousands of fruit fly papers are added to FlyBase and summarized. Without FlyBase, Berg said researchers and clinicians would struggle to keep up and could miss key connections about particular genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56f6fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers with the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/research/model-organisms-phase-ii/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzqmPDx5s$" target="_blank"&gt;Undiagnosed Diseases Network&lt;/a&gt; use FlyBase to help identify whether genetic mutations in children could be contributing to rare and unexplained diseases. The scientists identify genetic variants in these patients and then compare those mutations to past research of those genes in flies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54a947" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase is now crowdfunding support on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b19b3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the importance of FlyBase to the broader U.S. and international scientific research community, we are hopeful other institutions and other stakeholders at Harvard will support those efforts,” said James Chisholm, a spokesman for Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, adding that several Harvard departments were “actively working to identify and secure additional funding to safeguard FlyBase’s operations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03d63" class="body-graf"&gt;Two Harvard-based staffers have already been laid off from their work at FlyBase, and another six are scheduled for layoffs later in September and in early October, Perrimon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2001d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we cannot retain the key personnel, it’s going to be very difficult to get back those people who have knowledge to keep the databases running,” Perrimon said. “That would be the point of no return for FlyBase.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c1d4b5" class="body-graf"&gt;The funding disruption is also threatening plans to move FlyBase’s data to a new long-term home called the Alliance of Genome Resources. Fruit flies are among several common “model organisms,” along with rats, mice and worms, that are used in laboratories and lay the groundwork for understanding human biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b5cc3" class="body-graf"&gt;The National Institutes of Health has spent about &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://reporter.nih.gov/search/aP_gy-lZWES6IOBy6zZN3A/project-details/10976322__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzh8OYkhq$" target="_blank"&gt;$5 million a year since 2017&lt;/a&gt; to merge several databases, including FlyBase, WormBase and the Mouse Genome Database, among a handful of others. Each contains information that human health researchers can cross-reference to study genes important for human health more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25e41c" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re studying human genes and you have to study everything that’s known, you have to go to all of these [websites] and learn the system,” said Paul Sternberg, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, who is leading the Alliance effort. “We want one-stop shopping.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe1314" class="body-graf"&gt;The Alliance’s budget expired June 30, and Sternberg said he is awaiting a funding renewal decision from NIH himself. He said the funding disruption at FlyBase represents a new, unexpected obstacle to making&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;research findings more useful and easier to scour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf2e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to do this fast, but when you’re losing staff and energy, that’s what makes it dicey,” Sternberg said. “Don’t throw extra roadblocks.

The use of CT is on the rise, having increased about 30% since 2007, making the issue of CT radiation exposure and its link to cancer a growing concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulation in question is a CMS rule that was finalized in 2023 and slated to take effect in 2027. It requires hospital outpatient programs, which include emergency departments, to track and report the amount of radiation they use in CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule was originally meant to be mandatory for hospitals, but CMS in July proposed &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/calendar-year-2026-hospital-outpatient-prospective-payment-system-opps-and-ambulatory-surgical" data-link="native" class=""&gt;making it voluntary.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because some hospitals have said it may be complex to implement, especially smaller facilities that lack IT capabilities, according to CMS. Making it voluntary would give them more time to integrate and test the measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the reporting voluntary would be a “tremendous setback” for patient safety, said Smith-Bindman, who worked with CMS to develop a key measure used in the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMS gave Smith-Bindman and her UCSF team a $5 million grant in 2019 to create the measure to incentivize lower CT radiation doses. There was no technology at the time that would allow hospitals to track and report the measure, which must link electronic health record data with radiology data, Smith-Bindman said. So she and several other co-founders created Alara Imaging, which makes software that performs this function for hospitals for free. She has a minority ownership stake in Alara, along with UCSF and several other co-founders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert panel at CMS found Alara was the best way to roll out the measure reliably, and that the measure would lead to reductions in radiation dose, she said. Alara is a for-profit company but does not charge for this software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure takes into account various factors — including a patient’s size, the body part being imaged, and the reason for the imaging — and sets a cap for what’s considered an appropriate dose of radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The program being optional is going to lead to many hospitals not reporting on this measure, which would be such a backslide because that’s what’s really driving adoption,” Smith-Bindman said. “I’m trying to get the word out to say, ‘Yes, we care about CT doses. We care about safety. These doses should come down.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since July, she has been leading a campaign urging members of the public — patients, health care providers and health systems — to submit comments to CMS to keep the rule mandatory for hospitals. The public comment period is slated to end Monday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hospitals and medical physicists who work with radiologists on CT radiation safety disagree, and support making the rule voluntary. Some hospitals say they don’t have the resources to track and use the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do not have the dedicated resources within our health system to leverage the data gained from this measure to improve our CT radiation dose management,” one large health system in Idaho wrote in a public comment. “We do not see any value to improve patient care from this measure. Additionally, the software to interface with our electronic medical record might be free from the federal government, but the labor to implement it comes at a great cost, as our CT radiation technology is outsourced to a third party.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others have raised questions about the measure used in the rule, saying it has not been shown to improve patient care and is inconsistent with some internationally recognized standards for CT radiation doses.And some expressed concern that hospitals would have to use Alara Imaging to track and report the data, which presents a potential conflict of interest because Smith-Bindman and UCSF have a stake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman said it is not a conflict of interest, and that neither she nor Alara stands to gain financially if hospitals use Alara’s free software to implement the CMS rule. Alara is a for-profit company but does not charge for this software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman said the measure has been tested at 17 hospital systems, where radiologists found it helped optimize radiation doses, and validated by the National Quality Forum, which sets standards for quality in the health care industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s long been known that exposure to high doses of radiation causes cancer. This has been shown in studies on Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors and on people exposed to nuclear accidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether radiation from CT scans causes cancer has not been widely studied in the U.S., though European researchers have found that children who’ve undergone CT scans have a higher risk of some cancers, including leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/ct-scan-cancer-ucsf-study-20271473.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that CT scans may be more harmful than previously thought, and account for about 5% of new cancer cases annually in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the 93 million CTs performed on 60 million patients in 2023, an estimated 103,000 future cancers are projected to occur, according to the study, which was led by Smith-Bindman. That puts CT scans roughly on par with alcohol consumption and excess body weight in terms of its contribution to cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children, especially babies, have higher cancer risk from CTs than adults because their cells are more sensitive to radiation and because they have a longer life span within which to develop cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the CMS rule mandatory will help limit excessive radiation doses and avert 25,000 cancers each year, Smith-Bindman estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:56:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNck9QTW01TzJMV29jRVl0eXRLQ1pnMEVlSmRhX2w1YldFT0dOcWFaRHpTWXN2RGFRLTVVYWZZekJrUndSc21KXzVVN2ZlSTNnb2NlcTI1d0hRZ0l1T3UtLVNYbkFEcGgydzA1eXd5OUFKdE5ONElET19FTmlfT2pxUGZiUQ</guid></item><item><title>诺和诺德股票（ NVO ）在三剂试验达到19 ％减肥后上涨- TipRanks</title><link>https://www.tipranks.com/news/novo-nordisks-drug-trial-achieves-19-weight-loss-fuels-rivalry-with-eli-lilly</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="R9U5xJmA undefined  h_pxauto fontSize6 fontFamilyregular mobile_mx3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare company Novo Nordisk &lt;a data-ticker="NVO" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo"&gt;(NVO)&lt;/a&gt; has reported promising results from its latest clinical trial for its obesity treatment. Notably, tripling the drug’s dose helped patients achieve significantly more weight loss, strengthening the company’s position as it competes with U.S. rival Eli Lilly &lt;a data-ticker="LLY" href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/lly"&gt;(LLY)&lt;/a&gt; in the growing obesity treatment market. Following the trial results, Novo’s U.S.-listed shares were up 1% in pre-market hours on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Elevate Your Investing Strategy:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Take advantage of &lt;a data-link="article_promo" href="https://lp.tipranks.com/july-2025-50off/?llf=rss&amp;amp;timer=on&amp;amp;coupon=INTRO50P"&gt; TipRanks Premium at 50% off! &lt;/a&gt; Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, Wegovy is Novo Nordisk’s prescription drug for long-term weight management, using the active ingredient semaglutide, which is also sold as Ozempic for diabetes. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly offers Mounjaro and Zepbound, which use tirzepatide for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novo Nordisk Shows Progress, Yet Trails Eli Lilly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Novo’s two late-stage clinical trials, semaglutide showed strong results in testing a 7.2 mg dose, well above the current approved 2.4 mg dose. In the larger trial, patients lost an average of 19% of their body weight after 72 weeks, compared with 16% on the standard 2.4 mg dose and 4% on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the results were slightly lower than Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide, which achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at its top approved dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, experts see value in the incremental gains. Remarkably, Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, noted that the extra weight-loss benefit is significant, especially as the cost of high-dose tirzepatide has risen in certain regions. He also pointed out that semaglutide 7.2 mg could offer a more affordable alternative if priced competitively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race for Weight-Loss Market Heats Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The race for the weight-loss drug market is intensifying as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk compete to capture market share. With recent trial results and new dosing strategies, investors and patients are closely watching how both companies will perform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Novo has lost ground in the U.S. to both Lilly and other copycat drugs, and its shares have dropped 60% over the past year. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/novo-nordisk-stock-nvo-under-pressure-as-it-cuts-jobs-and-lowers-outlook"&gt;Novo announced a major restructuring&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its global workforce by 11%, or about 9,000 jobs. Amid these challenges, investors have been hoping that Novo Nordisk would strengthen its pipeline of new obesity drugs, as many view Eli Lilly as offering more options in clinical trials. Even so, the latest data shows that semaglutide can still provide meaningful incremental gains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLY or NVO: Which Pharma Stock Offers Higher Upside?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/healthcare-stocks"&gt;TipRanks Stock Comparison tool,&lt;/a&gt; we analyzed NVO and LLY to determine which stock offers greater upside potential, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to TipRanks, &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo"&gt;NVO stock&lt;/a&gt; carries a Moderate Buy rating, with an &lt;a href="https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nvo/forecast"&gt;average price target of $67.71,&lt;/a&gt; implying a 23.4% upside from current levels.

The research adds to prior reports of spikes in &lt;a href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019" data-link="native" class=""&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/apl9451317.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;injuries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32008905/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;traffic crashes&lt;/a&gt; after people lose an hour of sleep when daylight saving time starts in March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first real piece of evidence that staying in permanent standard time would be better, from a biological perspective, than either permanent daylight saving time or the current shift twice per year,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jamie-zeitzer" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Jamie Zeitzer&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., a Stanford psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor and the study’s senior author. “Until now, we’ve just had theories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitzer and his colleague found major health benefits to ending the spring forward from standard time to daylight saving time. Using mathematical models and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers estimated that sticking with standard time all year would prevent about 300,000 strokes annually and lead to 2.6 million fewer people with obesity nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason our seasonal time shifts are so damaging is how they impact our circadian rhythms, the internal clocks that regulate most body processes and are vital to a functioning immune system and sleep cycle. Out-of-whack circadian rhythms are linked to a wide range of health issues, including stroke and obesity. One way circadian rhythms get scrambled is by being exposed to light at the wrong time: morning light can help body clocks stay synchronized, while evening light can slow them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the best analogy is that your circadian clock is acting in the body like a conductor acts in an orchestra,” Zeitzer said. “With a weak conductor, it might still sound fine in the violin section or the flute section, but the audience hears a cacophony. And that’s what happens in the body, too, with everything just a little bit off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at the three possible time policies based on how they affect light exposure and impact circadian rhythms and overall health throughout the year. They found permanent standard time was best overall, permanent daylight saving time was second, and our current practice of switching back and forth was the absolute worst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings varied a bit based on region and between night owls and morning larks. Those who like to stay up later (you know who you are) bear the greater negative health effects of the seasonal time switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/657584/half-daylight-saving-time-sunsetted.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;widespread dislike&lt;/a&gt; for the more-than-&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Daylight-Saving-Time" data-link="native" class=""&gt;century&lt;/a&gt;-old institution of daylight saving time, the best alternative option remains up for &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-daylight-saving-time-make-sense-scientists-debate-pros-and-cons" data-link="native" class=""&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt;. Health organizations like the &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt; support standard time, in favor of more morning light. Meanwhile, bills proposing permanent daylight saving time, which means more evening light, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/139" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; Congress nearly every year, but have yet to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way they modeled this study is genius,” said Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh who focuses on sleep medicine but wasn’t involved in the study. “We know that we should end the twice-yearly shifts, but there’s this argument about which way we should go.

He also cautions there are other factors that must be considered in a policy change, like the economic effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some scientists, a change is a no-brainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there is a great health argument for ending daylight saving time,” said Karin Johnson, a neurologist at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School who was not involved in the study. “Hopefully, policymakers will add this study to their data and listen to science and listen to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:28:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxObjhKWVBVQi1BWXhHcWZpZ0FWZHdSVFoyVVU4MkI3a25iTmZXMldJZkxFdHJVUnA0NklPdUNkQWpuVko2VGdRb0pkLVhzRHprdnRPN2VmS1h2ckRCYmhiWl9VWnBKMlZXaHRqS2U0ak03RWJKejlXdThTZ3pUOVJ0djBJVEEyMTQ3VDV0Qkkxcm1zdw</guid></item><item><title>关于“接吻虫”疾病的注意事项：症状、风险等-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/well/kissing-bug-chagas-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 21:27:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE1PMkFTdFRUTXY0ZGp2VTJscmd2T1FlU04wR3k2aGF3VlhKc2dTYkFscmJLbkl3QjN5SXdJNHc3cFBrcnZmTXZkTkJ0cUszWVNBNnhraWZ3bzFWY1EwMEJyVlhxYi14ZXZVaVoyREZfUDczbkZFd0lGWUl2WQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.为CDC疫苗咨询小组增加了更多反疫苗成员- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/meet-the-latest-anti-vaccine-voices-on-rfk-jr-s-cdc-advisory-panel/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;

Those include the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, the de-worming drug ivermectin, and various concoctions of vitamins and other drugs. Milhoan has stated that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should be removed from the market, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/"&gt;telling KFF in March&lt;/a&gt;: "We should stop it and test it more before we move forward."&lt;/p&gt;

The hospital settled the suit, paying $2.5 million, while denying wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet at the end of this week, on September 18 and September 19. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;an agenda recently posted online&lt;/a&gt;, the committee will vote on recommendations for a measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) combination vaccine, the Hepatitis B vaccine, and this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine experts &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/14/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-to-consider-major-changes-to-childhood-shots-00563165"&gt;widely fear&lt;/a&gt; that the committee will rescind recommendations and restrict access to those vaccines. Such moves will likely create new, potentially insurmountable barriers for people, including children, to get vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP-recommended vaccines are required to be covered by private health insurance plans and the Vaccines for Children program for Medicaid-eligible and under- or uninsured kids, which covers about half of American children. Without ACIP recommendations for a vaccine, insurance coverage would be an open question, and vulnerable children would simply lose access entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomere damage drives T cell exhaustion. Antioxidants restored their cancer-fighting strength in mice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumor environments place heavy stress on immune cells that fight cancer. Limited oxygen, elevated acidity, and other harsh conditions overload mitochondria, the cell’s energy producers, which contributes to T cell fatigue and worsens cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Immunity&lt;/em&gt;, led by researchers at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-pittsburgh/"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, showed in mice that these conditions prompt mitochondria to release reactive oxygen &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;species&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A species is a group of living organisms that share a set of common characteristics and are able to breed and produce fertile offspring. The concept of a species is important in biology as it is used to classify and organize the diversity of life. There are different ways to define a species, but the most widely accepted one is the biological species concept, which defines a species as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce viable offspring in nature. This definition is widely used in evolutionary biology and ecology to identify and classify living organisms.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; (ROS). These molecules travel to the nucleus and damage telomeres, ultimately pushing T cells into a dysfunctional state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The really exciting part about this research is that by preventing damage to telomeres via a targeted antioxidant, we can rescue T cell function,” said lead author Dayana Rivadeneira, assistant professor in the Pitt Department of Immunology and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center. “This opens the door to novel therapies to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Unexpected mitochondrial connection&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivadeneira and senior author Greg Delgoffe, a professor in the Pitt Department of Immunology and UPMC Hillman, did not originally plan to investigate telomeres. Their initial focus was on how mitochondrial damage influences T cell performance. A collaboration with Patricia Opresko, professor in the Pitt Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, and the late Marcel Bruchez, professor of biological sciences and chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, expanded the study to include telomeric damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the team engineered mice with a genetic system that produces highly localized oxidative damage at either telomeres or mitochondria when exposed to far-red light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we found was remarkable,” said Delgoffe. “Whether we damaged the mitochondria or the telomeres, we got the same result: dysfunctional T cells. There is crosstalk between the engine of the cell and the brains of the cell, the mitochondria, and the nucleus. This is something we didn’t necessarily appreciate, at least in the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you damage the mitochondria, one of the first thing that gets damaged is the telomeres,” Rivadeneira added. “And, likewise, when you damage the telomeres, they talk back to the mitochondria to initiate a program that tells the cell to shut down and become exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Antioxidant therapy to restore function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because ROS — highly reactive oxygen molecules that cause cellular damage — were responsible for telomeric damage, Delgoffe and Rivadeneira hypothesized that ROS-neutralizing antioxidants could protect or restore T cell function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To neutralize ROS specifically at telomeres, they took mouse T cells and tethered an antioxidant protein to another protein that resides at telomeres. When they infused these T cells into mice with an aggressive form of melanoma, the animals had much better survival and smaller tumors than those given regular T cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Potential for CAR-T therapy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this antioxidant approach could be applied to CAR-T therapy, which involves taking a patient’s T cells and genetically engineering them to better recognize cancer cells before reinfusing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research is highly translatable because this approach could easily be incorporated into standard CAR-T protocol,” said Delgoffe. “While you’re genetically engineering T cells to improve cancer-fighting capability, you could also make them bulletproof against oxidative damage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are working to develop a similar telomere-specific antioxidant approach for modifying human T cells, which they eventually hope to test in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her newly launched lab, Rivadeneira also plans to investigate more broadly how telomere health influences the immune system and cancer outcomes. One area of interest is understanding how chemotherapy alters T cell function by damaging telomeres and whether this could influence whether patients respond to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Just days before vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meet to weigh who should get COVID vaccines this season, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected five more members to the committee he purged of Biden administration appointees in June. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members of the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist at AscensionRx, who also hosts a podcast, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and an affiliate of the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/dr-kirk-milhoan-acip/" target="_blank"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an ob/gyn and functional medicine practitioner, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catherine Stein, an epidemiology professor at Case Western Reserve University, &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" target="_blank"&gt;who has claimed&lt;/a&gt; the government overstated COVID risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The new ACIP members bring a wealth of real-world public health experience to the job of making immunization recommendations," said &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services and Acting Director of the CDC in a media statement. "We are grateful for their service in helping restore the public confidence in vaccines that was lost during the Biden era."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advisory group – now numbering 12 members – makes recommendations that help determine which vaccines are offered free through the Vaccines for Children program, and what health insurers typically cover. They also influence state and local laws around vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The appointments expand the committee just before it meets this week in Atlanta. On Thursday and Friday, the members will be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/agendas.html" target="_blank"&gt;considering policies such as&lt;/a&gt; who should get the fall COVID-19 booster shot, and whether all babies should get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Short list of members leaked in early September &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members were among seven that appeared on a list that was first reported by the &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-rfk-jr-seeks-to-rush-7-new" target="_blank"&gt;"Inside Medicine" newsletter&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 3. Two others who were named then — Dr. Joseph Fraiman, an emergency medical physician, and Dr. John Gaitanis, a pediatric neurologist at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Rhode Island — were not appointed to the committee by HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to each of the new members of the committee earlier this month, when their names first appeared in media reports. Only one responded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, was still in the midst of the vetting process on Sept. 5. "I think I'd be an ideal choice for a committee like this," he told NPR. "I have expertise in clinical trial management and ethics, and my background in transplant biology allows me to understand the science of what is being proposed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pollak says he had not paid much attention to ACIP before he joined the committee, but he sees having non-vaccine experts on the panel as a plus. "I think it's a value to have broad representation of the community at large, both with and without the necessary expertise in order to formulate policy that makes sense to everybody," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while Pollack considers COVID vaccines "safe to administer and provided a benefit in that it kept down the severity of the illness and prevented hospitalization," he says the vaccine rollout was "poorly managed," contributing to hysteria and conspiracy theories that the government covered up harms and injuries related to the vaccine. "The notion that the government tried to 'cover it up' is false," Pollak says. "All of the information on adverse effects is readily available in the medical literature. The problem is it tends to stay within the profession and doesn't get disseminated widely amongst the public."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Kennedy's imprint on vaccine panel grows&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members join the seven others Kennedy named to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;panel in June&lt;/a&gt;, replacements he handpicked after firing all 17 of the panel's previously seated members. The replacements, who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;met for the first time&lt;/a&gt; at the CDC in June, include Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about COVID and &lt;a href="https://www.malone.news/p/patient-rights-are-not-a-scientific" target="_blank"&gt;opposed vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;, and Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management who gained prominence during the pandemic for criticizing COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The members Kennedy fired had been chosen for their medical expertise and understanding of vaccine policy, and had been formally vetted to ensure that they &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323771/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisers-conflicts-interest" target="_blank"&gt;would not directly financially benefit&lt;/a&gt; from any ACIP votes. They had been serving in overlapping rotations over several years to ensure continuity of expertise and process.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There are large gaps in the new ACIP's composition in terms of their missing expertise on vaccinology, their missing expertise on primary care, their missing expertise on cost effectiveness and clinical trials," says Noel Brewer, a former ACIP member who had served on the committee for a year before being dismissed by Kennedy in June. "These are folks who fundamentally do not understand vaccines in a deep way. I wouldn't take medical advice from them, and I certainly don't think they should be setting policy for the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since Kennedy overhauled the panel, the ACIP has seen major changes to how it operates, for instance voting to effectively ban flu vaccines with the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html" target="_blank"&gt;in their June meeting&lt;/a&gt;. The change was based on debunked claims without new scientific evidence of harms. This move, among others, has led top medical organizations and public health groups to question the integrity of the group's advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Misinformation, politicization of commonsense public health efforts, and sudden changes to federal vaccine guidance is creating mass confusion and diminishing trust in public health. As we head into another fall season sure to be marked by cases of flu, Covid-19, and RSV as well as the alarming reappearance of measles and pertussis, the stakes could not be higher," the presidents of five professional medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians wrote, in a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/vaccine-policy-us-aafp-aap-acp-acog-idsa-presidents/" target="_blank"&gt;June op-ed in Stat News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many state vaccine laws are tied to ACIP guidance. Some states led by Democratic governors are starting to reduce their reliance on the committee over concerns that future recommendations may be based on &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/06/nx-s1-5532121/states-vaccine-guidance-washington-oregon-new-mexico" target="_blank"&gt;"ideology and not science,"&lt;/a&gt; says Dennis Worsham, health secretary for the Washington State Department of Health, which has formed a vaccine policy alliance with California, Oregon and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ACIP members are Catherine Stein, PhD, a professor in the Department of Population &amp;amp; Quantitative Health at Case Western Reserve University; Evelyn Griffin, MD, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Baton Rouge General Hospital in Louisiana; Hillary Blackburn, PharmD, MBA, director of medication access affordability with Ascension Rx in St. Louis; Kirk Milhoan, MD, PhD, a pediatric cardiologist and medical director at For Hearts and Souls Free Medical Clinic in Hawaii; and Raymond Pollak, MD, a semi-retired surgeon and transplant specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The new ACIP members bring a wealth of real-world public health experience to the job of making immunization recommendations," Jim O’Neill, deputy secretary of HHS and acting director of the CDC, said in an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;HHS press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New members include more COVID vaccine critics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the new members continues Kennedy's efforts to remake ACIP, which develops the vaccine recommendations that are typically adopted by the CDC and are often required for health insurance coverage. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;Kennedy fired&lt;/a&gt; the 17 sitting members of the group, saying a "clean sweep" was needed to restore public confidence in vaccines. He then named seven new members with comparatively little experience in immunology and vaccinology, several of whom share his anti-vaccine views. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said the five new members will bring "diverse expertise that strengthens the committee and ensures it fulfills its mission with transparency, independence, and gold-standard science."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as with the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/rfk-announces-new-acip-members-including-vaccine-critics"&gt;first group&lt;/a&gt; of ACIP members named by Kennedy, some of the new members appear to align with Kennedy's views on COVID-19 vaccines and the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milhoan is a &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/"&gt;senior fellow&lt;/a&gt; at the anti-mRNA Independent Medical Alliance and has claimed that COVID vaccines pose more harm than benefit, Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/03/kennedy-prepares-to-name-new-acip-members-00542750"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Stein, who has researched tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, told Ohio lawmakers that health officials in the state were inflating COVID-19 death and hospitalization numbers and has made other assertions downplaying the pandemic, according to the &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ohio Capital Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffin has expressed vaccine skepticism and testified against Louisiana's decision to add COVID-19 vaccines to the school immunization schedule, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/washington-watch/washington-watch/117299"&gt;Medpage Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HHS statement does not say whether the new members will participate in the next &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;ACIP meeting&lt;/a&gt;, which will be held on September 18 and 19 at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, but an HHS spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/kennedy-appoints-five-new-members-us-vaccine-panel-2025-09-15/"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt; they will be taking part. ACIP members are slated to discuss and take votes on proposed recommendations for use of the hepatitis B and the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines on day 1 of the meeting. On day 2, they will discuss and take votes on updated COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's note: &lt;/strong&gt;This story was updated on September 16 at 7:30am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Chagas disease, known as the “kissing bug” disease, has long been thought of as a neglected tropical illness, but some researchers now argue it’s endemic to the United States. But a lack of awareness means it’s undercounted, undertreated and under-researched. What do you want to know about Chagas or other diseases spread by bugs in the United States?

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00401-025-02912-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Acta Neuropathologica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that a protein indicating brain inflammation appears in a specific brain region at the same time as the first pathological hallmarks of the disease. This discovery could pave the way for earlier diagnoses and new therapeutic strategies aimed at halting the neurodegenerative disorder in its initial stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually destroys memory, thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. For decades, research has focused on two key features of the disease: the buildup of sticky protein clumps called amyloid-beta plaques outside of nerve cells, and the formation of tangled tau proteins inside them. Another significant component of the disease is neuroinflammation, a persistent inflammatory response in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inflammation is largely driven by the brain’s resident immune cells, known as microglia. While neuroinflammation is known to be an early event in Alzheimer’s, the precise timing, location, and cellular details of its onset have remained unclear. Researchers conducted this study to create a detailed timeline of these early changes, hoping to identify a reliable biomarker that could signal the disease’s presence at its most nascent phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the research team used a comprehensive approach, tracking the disease’s progression in a well-established mouse model of Alzheimer’s. The mice, known as 5XFAD mice, are genetically engineered to develop an aggressive, early-onset form of the disease that mirrors some aspects of inherited Alzheimer’s in humans. The scientists studied both male and female mice at multiple life stages: 1.5, 3, 7, and 12 months of age. This life-course analysis allowed them to map out the sequence of pathological events, from the molecular level to observable behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation began by establishing when cognitive symptoms appeared. Using a spatial learning test called the Barnes maze, the researchers found that female 5XFAD mice began showing significant memory deficits at 7 months of age, while males showed deficits at 12 months. This confirmed that any biological changes occurring before these time points could be considered pre-symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team examined the brains of the mice for the telltale amyloid-beta plaques. They discovered that the very first plaques appeared at just 1.5 months of age, and they did so in a specific brain region called the subiculum, an area associated with the hippocampus and involved in memory. In concert with this, blood tests revealed that a serum ratio of two amyloid-beta peptides, a known indicator of early plaque formation, was also elevated at 1.5 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, another blood biomarker called neurofilament light chain, which signals neuron damage, did not rise until much later, around 7 months of age. This timeline showed that amyloid pathology begins months before cognitive symptoms emerge and well before widespread nerve cell damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central focus of the study was a protein called Translocator protein 18 kDa, or TSPO. This protein is present at low levels in a healthy brain but increases significantly when brain cells are under stress or during inflammation, making it a key indicator of neuroinflammation. Using a technique called quantitative autoradiography, which measures protein levels in brain slices, the researchers measured TSPO across different brain regions and ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TSPO levels first increased at 1.5 months of age, at the same time and in the exact same brain region, the subiculum, where the first amyloid plaques appeared. As the mice aged and plaques spread to other areas like the hippocampus and cortex, TSPO levels rose in those regions as well. This finding directly linked the onset of neuroinflammation to the initial formation of amyloid pathology, long before any cognitive impairment was detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established this connection, the researchers sought to identify which brain cells were responsible for producing the excess TSPO. Using an advanced imaging technique called quadruple-label immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, they were able to simultaneously visualize amyloid plaques, TSPO, microglia, and a second type of brain support cell called astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the surge in TSPO was almost exclusively located in microglia. While astrocytes also became activated as the disease progressed, they did not show an increase in TSPO. Going a step further, the analysis showed that the microglia with the highest concentrations of TSPO were those in direct physical contact with amyloid plaques. Microglia located farther away from plaques showed much lower TSPO levels. This indicates that the TSPO signal seen in brain scans is not just a general sign of inflammation but specifically reflects the activity of immune cells engaging with amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if these findings in mice were relevant to humans, the team performed a similar analysis on postmortem brain tissue from people who had an aggressive, early-onset form of Alzheimer’s caused by a specific genetic mutation (PSEN1-E280A). This form of the disease has a rapid progression similar to that seen in the 5XFAD mice. The human brain tissue analysis confirmed the mouse findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TSPO levels were significantly elevated in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to healthy controls. The increased TSPO was again localized to microglia, and the microglia containing the most TSPO were those clustered around amyloid plaques. This confirmation provides strong evidence that the mechanisms observed in the mouse model are applicable to human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does have some limitations. The analysis of human tissue was conducted on a small number of samples, all of which were from male subjects. Future work should include a larger and more diverse group of human samples. Additionally, both the mouse model and the human cases studied represent early-onset, genetically driven forms of Alzheimer’s, which account for a small fraction of all cases. Research is needed to see if these findings hold true for the more common, late-onset sporadic form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are already beginning to address these questions by studying mouse models that lack the TSPO protein and by expanding their work to include late-onset Alzheimer’s cases.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some public health experts are worried that the votes will — at a minimum — raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m tightening my seat belt,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-director-susan-monarez-50dfbec849b53b4593755d2e6e616687"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replaced it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the three vaccines being discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past June, Kennedy’s ACIP voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-flu-vaccine-thimerosal-c5696bbc19f345323153d5336cb5e798"&gt;recommend flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that meeting, Kennedy &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC’s recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors’ groups and public health organizations, and prompted a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuit-vaccines-kennedy-95a1aa23c3f015f7a35a570f5ef8da36"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Days after Kennedy’s announcement, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;CDC officials said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government’s Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It’s now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this fall’s COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-kids-what-to-know-5ddb5e3e92b12a6f5044dc229e19590d"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then “that would take away access for roughly half of America’s kids,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 1991, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested in June they wanted to revisit the guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner noted that health officials used to rely on screening mothers before birth but that many cases were missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were lots of failures,” he said. “And so there were continuing transmissions from mother to child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MMRV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus — called varicella — also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a combination MMRV shot — measles, mumps, rubella and varicella — was licensed. The CDC initially recommended that doctors and parents use the combo shot over separate MMR and varicella injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within a few years, studies showed children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the ACIP &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5903a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;changed its recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, removing the preferential language and saying either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most pediatricians suggest separate doses for the first shot, but give the combined shot for the second dose, pediatrics experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there’s no new evidence about harms from MMRV shots, said O’Leary, of AAP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why revisit it now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This version of the ACIP is an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HHS announces new committee members&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, HHS officials on Monday announced five new committee members — bringing the roster to 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new members are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist and podcaster who HHS officials said is director of medication access and affordability for AscensionRx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-p0kFdcVkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Raymond Pollak, a transplant specialist based in Skokie, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Catherine Stein, a Case Western Reserve University disease researcher. During the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she worked with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; an Ohio anti-vaccine group and argued that case counts were inaccurate and that the coronavirus was not as dangerous as health officials portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚀 SpaceX introduces a new propulsion system to help maintain the &lt;strong&gt;International Space Station’s&lt;/strong&gt; orbit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔧 The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon&lt;/strong&gt; spacecraft’s trunk now features additional &lt;strong&gt;Draco thrusters&lt;/strong&gt; for efficient reboost operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌐 This mission marks a collaborative effort between &lt;strong&gt;NASA&lt;/strong&gt; and commercial partners like &lt;strong&gt;SpaceX&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Northrop Grumman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📈 Future Dragon missions will further enhance the flexibility and capabilities of space station operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s latest mission to the International Space Station (ISS) marks a significant step forward in space exploration and station maintenance. As part of its 33rd cargo delivery to the ISS, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft not only carried essential supplies and scientific experiments but also introduced a novel propulsion system designed to boost the station’s orbit. Historically, this task has been managed by the Russian space agency using their Progress cargo vehicles. However, with the new upgrades to the Dragon spacecraft, SpaceX aims to share this responsibility, ensuring the ISS remains in optimal orbit. This mission underscores the evolving role of commercial companies in space operations, paving the way for future innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SpaceX’s Innovative Contribution to Orbit Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the responsibility of maintaining the International Space Station’s altitude has fallen solely on the Russian space agency. With the retirement of NASA’s space shuttle fleet in 2011, the task of reboosting the ISS became a Russian domain, using their Progress cargo freighters. These vehicles not only elevate the station’s orbit but also refuel its propellant tanks, enabling the station to perform maneuvers when necessary. However, the landscape is shifting as NASA collaborates with SpaceX and Northrop Grumman to enhance their spacecraft with reboost capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s recent mission introduces a new dynamic. The Dragon spacecraft, equipped with a unique propulsion system, aims to contribute to the station’s orbital maintenance. This new rocket pack is strategically mounted inside the spacecraft’s trunk section. It is designed to counteract the gradual decay of the ISS’s altitude due to the thin atmospheric presence at its orbit. This development marks a significant milestone, as it diversifies the means available to ensure the station’s continued operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wOEmRQ7gNo"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/prodigy-rejects-musks-vision-teen-who-joined-spacex-at-14-sparks-storm-at-16-by-leaving-for-a-rival-tech-venture/"&gt;“Prodigy Rejects Musk’s Vision”: Teen Who Joined SpaceX At 14 Sparks Storm At 16 By Leaving For A Rival Tech Venture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Technical Challenges and Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the new propulsion system aboard the Dragon spacecraft was not without its challenges. SpaceX engineers had to devise a solution that would allow the spacecraft to effectively boost the ISS’s orbit. The new propulsion pack is situated in the trunk of the Dragon, a hollow, unpressurized compartment beneath the pressurized cargo cabin. This innovative design includes two additional Draco thrusters, aligned with the station’s velocity vector to ensure efficient propellant use. These thrusters, coupled with six dedicated propellant tanks, allow for precise control during reboost operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s approach contrasts with Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft, which demonstrated its reboost capability in 2022. Although the Cygnus connects at a less ideal position on the ISS, its steerable main engine compensates for this by directing thrust appropriately. In contrast, the Dragon’s fixed thrusters achieve similar outcomes through strategic alignment and propellant management. This solution exemplifies SpaceX’s commitment to innovation in space technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VWnHoCFv10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/09/silicon-breached-the-neon-layer-chandra-observatory-reveals-massive-stars-violent-internal-collapse-before-supernova-explosion/"&gt;“Silicon Breached the Neon Layer”: Chandra Observatory Reveals Massive Star’s Violent Internal Collapse Before Supernova Explosion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Implications for Space Missions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of the current mission has broader implications for the future of space exploration and station maintenance. By equipping the Dragon spacecraft with reboost capabilities, SpaceX is setting a precedent for commercial involvement in orbital operations. This advancement not only supports the ISS’s ongoing mission but also paves the way for future projects. Notably, the propulsion system’s design is a precursor to a larger-scale version planned for the US Deorbit Vehicle, which will eventually decommission the ISS in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s continued innovation in space technology is evident in its plans for future Dragon missions. The ability to customize the spacecraft’s trunk to accommodate either reboost kits or scientific payloads highlights the flexibility and adaptability of the company’s approach. As space missions become increasingly complex, the integration of commercial capabilities will be crucial to sustaining human presence in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H1PaRexREG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/08/they-brought-something-back-from-space-dragon-capsules-6700-pound-cargo-contains-technology-that-changes-everything-about-earths-future/"&gt;“They Brought Something Back from Space” Dragon Capsule’s 6,700-Pound Cargo Contains Technology That Changes Everything About Earth’s Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative Efforts in Space Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration between NASA and private companies like SpaceX and Northrop Grumman represents a new era in space exploration. By leveraging the expertise and resources of commercial partners, NASA can focus on advancing scientific research and exploration goals. The partnership with SpaceX, in particular, has been instrumental in enhancing the capabilities of the Dragon spacecraft, enabling it to play a vital role in the ISS’s maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collaborative model extends beyond reboost operations. SpaceX’s Dragon missions have facilitated the delivery of over 300,000 pounds of cargo to the ISS, supporting more than 1,000 scientific projects. These missions are not only essential for sustaining the station’s operations but also for contributing to research that has direct applications on Earth. The ongoing partnership between NASA and commercial entities underscores the importance of cooperation in advancing the frontiers of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As SpaceX continues to innovate and contribute to space missions, questions arise about the future of space exploration. With the successful integration of commercial capabilities into orbital operations, how will this influence the development of future technologies and the exploration of more distant frontiers? As we look to the stars, the role of private companies in shaping the future of space travel becomes increasingly significant.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the solution might be as simple as using special eye drops two or three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 766 patients presented on September 14 at the 43&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) [1], found that the majority could read an extra two, three or more lines on the eye chart used for testing near visual acuity (the Jaeger chart) after using specially formulated eye drops. This improvement was sustained for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: "We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management. Current solutions such as reading glasses or surgical interventions have limitations, including inconvenience, social discomfort, and potential risks or complications. There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient and effective alternative."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye drops, developed by Dr Benozzi's father, the late Dr Jorge Benozzi of the same centre, contain a combination of two active agents: pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a muscle controlling the eye's accommodation for seeing objects at varying distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and the discomfort that pilocarpine often causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients administered the eye drops twice a day, usually on waking and again approximately six hours later, with an optional third dose if symptoms recurred or additional visual comfort was needed. The group of patients (373 women and 393 men, with an average age of 55) were divided into three groups to receive one of three eye drop formulations. Each formulation had a fixed dose of diclofenac but concentrations of pilocarpine were 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the improvement in how well patients could read the Jaeger chart without reading glasses (uncorrected near visual acuity) one hour after the first administration of the drops, and they followed up the patients for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi told the Congress: "Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months. Importantly, no significant adverse events like increased intraocular pressure or retinal detachment were observed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2% group, 69% of 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart, and in the 3% group, 84% of 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the patients' vision was sustained for up to two years, with a median duration of 434 days. Adverse side effects were mild, with the most common being temporary dim vision, which occurred in 32% of cases, irritation when the drops were instilled (3.7%) and headache (3.8%). No patients discontinued the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common adverse side effects of pilocarpine can also include eye redness, watery eyes, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, sensitivity to light or problems changing focus between objects, seeing flashes of light or "floaters" in vision, and, in rare cases, detached retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi continued: "Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline. Our study revealed that optimal pilocarpine concentrations could be individualized depending on the baseline severity of presbyopia as assessed by the initial Jaeger scores. Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded: "These results suggest this combination therapy offers a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management. It significantly reduces dependence on reading glasses, providing a convenient, non-invasive option for patients, although these eye drops may not eliminate the need for glasses in all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, this treatment is not intended to replace surgical interventions, but rather to serve as a valuable solution for patients who need safe, effective, and personalised alternatives and seek freedom from the inconvenience of eyewear. Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the group of patients in this study, Dr Benozzi has other patients who have received the treatment for more than ten years. Dr Benozzi plans further research to measure improvements in patients' quality of life, and to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms of the eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of the study include the large number of patients included and the long follow-up time. It is the first systematic evaluation comparing three different pilocarpine concentrations in combination with diclofenac. A limitation is that it is a retrospective, single-centre study, which could limit the generalizability of the findings and introduce selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESCRS President-Elect, Professor Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, was not involved in the research. He commented: "While surgery for age-related near vision loss has advanced, some patients are not candidates. The single-centre retrospective study by Dr Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended."&lt;/p&gt;

When you’re focused on making maximum fitness progress while also juggling a busy work calendar, every advantage counts. So, we’ve tested and selected the best pre-workout supplements of the year—working with a registered dietitian to ensure ingredients and quality are our focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="paywall"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pre-workout formulas combine carefully selected ingredients, such as caffeine and beta-alanine to deliver a fast, noticeable boost in energy, focus, and endurance when it matters most. Like the &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/article/best-protein-powders/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/article/best-protein-powders/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;best protein powders&lt;/a&gt;, these supplements offer a great way to train harder, finish stronger, and elevate fitness routines even within packed schedules.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workouts of 2025&lt;/h2&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workouts Comparison Table&lt;/h2&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workout Overall: Transparent Labs Bulk&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Transparent Labs Bulk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;Clean, fully transparent formula for muscle gain and energy&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Transparent Labs Bulk  &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We chose Transparent Labs Bulk as our top pick overall because it’s well formulated and clinically dosed. There is 275 mg of caffeine; but the addition of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724001684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724001684" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; 200 mg of L-Theanine&lt;/a&gt; may help prevent some of the jitters that can come with highly caffeinated pre-workout products. The product also has&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; 4,000 mg of beta-alanine&lt;/a&gt;, which is the clinically-researched dose and may produce a light tingling sensation (aka paresthesia), which some athletes may enjoy. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete, a registered dietitian, rated the instructions and ease of following them a 5 out of 5. “The instructions are clear, and they provide two options based on your experience with pre-workout powders, specifically the caffeine content in these higher dosed formulas. It’s recommended that you start out by taking half of a scoop to determine your tolerance. Then, if increased intensity is desired, you can take more.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our tester is used to taking pre-workout, saying, “The tingles don’t hit me too hard, but consumers new to pre-workout may feel this a lot more.” He really enjoyed his workout after taking Transparent Labs Bulk. “I felt the muscle pumps from the 8,000 mg of citrulline malate, and I felt energized throughout the whole session. I did a 10-minute warmup, fifteen minutes of strength work (squats), and then a fifteen 15-minute workout of sled push, handstand walks, and rowing.” He rated the side effects a 5 out of 5, having no negative reactions after taking this pre-workout. 


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Transparent Labs Bulk as best pre-workout supplement" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=256&amp;amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TL-Bulk2.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=85"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete recommends this product as an elite-level pre-workout, because it is clinically dosed, has a decent amount of caffeine, and contains solid doses of both &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;citrulline malate&lt;/a&gt; and beta-alanine, which have been researched for their performance benefits. “This product would work better for bodybuilders than HIIT/CrossFit/Hyrox athletes because of the pump ingredients,” he said. “I also like that they avoid artificial ingredients, which are prevalent in pre-workout powders.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Non-Stim Pre-Workout: Legion Pulse Stim-Free&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Legion Pulse Stim-Free&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;Clinically dosed, caffeine-free formula&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Legion Pulse Stim-Free &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Legion Pulse Stim-Free is our favorite stim-free pre-workout, as it combines research-backed ingredients like citrulline, beta-alanine, and betaine for impressive pumps and endurance without using caffeine or artificial additives. Its all-natural, transparent formula supports steady energy, focus, and muscle performance, making it ideal for athletes who want powerful workout effects with no crash. If desired, you can choose to add caffeine to the formulation, so it’s customizable as well.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayla tested Legion Pulse, rating it a 5 out of 5 on how well it mixes together. She said, “The product mixed in perfectly and wasn’t overly foamy. Thirty seconds is sufficient to get it all dissolved properly.” Kayla mentioned that if shaken for too long, some products can get overly foamy. But this product did great with a sixty second shake test. “The mixture wasn’t gritty, and it fully incorporated into the water. I did this with the one-scoop serving size.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the instructions for mixing, Kayla wishes it had a bit more detail for users, rating it a 3 out of 5. “This product recommends 10-12 ounces for either one or two scoops … wish it would break down optimal water ratios for how many scoops you would like to do. I think 10-12 is the optimal amount for one scoop but with two it can be a little thick.”  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tester tried both the stim-free and the stim version of this pre-workout and thinks there’s no need to do two scoops unless you want more beta-alanine for the tingly feels. “It can be confusing for users when fitness supplements call for more than one scoop, and it can be too much product to mix. I rated it a three for this reason.” 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayla loves the Pink Lemonade flavor of Legion Pulse Stim-Free, and tailors the ratio to suit her best. “I don’t like overly sweet drinks, so I add twelve ounces of water, and it tastes great. It’s like a normal pink lemonade drink with a little extra kick of caffeine. I do taste the stevia slightly, but it’s hard to mask that taste once you know it’s there.” She still rated the flavor a 5 out of 5, as this is her go-to pre-workout of choice.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Budget Pre-Workout: Nutricost Pre-&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt; Pre-Workout&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Nutricost Pre-X Pre-Workout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;High-stim pre-workout with 300mg caffeine and energy-boosting B vitamins&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Nutricost Pre-X Pre-Workout &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutricost Pre-X Pre-Workout offers an energy boost with 300 mg of caffeine and B vitamins in every serving, making it a top pick for athletes and lifters who want intensity without spending much. This one only costs about $0.92 per serving if you buy a 60-serving container, which is more affordable than others on this list. Available in fun flavors like Fruit Punch and Blue Raspberry, this product is gluten-free, third-party tested, and delivers solid value for budget-conscious folks who can tolerate high caffeine levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="5"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayla tested this product and provided us with her first impressions. “The packaging gives off an impression of budget branding. I’m well aware of the Nutricost brand so it’s not offputting to me.” She says the price is attractive, and it doesn’t come off as cheap. “The packaging is on the larger side for their products, it’s not easy to slip in a purse, but it would fit in a work bag or backpack.” She also notes that the scoop handle is on the longer side, so it can be annoying to fit back in after you’ve dug it out of the tub, especially when first using the product. For this reason, she rated it a 3. 


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nutricost Pre-X as best pre-workout supplement" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=256&amp;amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nutricost-PreX.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=85"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our tester did notice some minor side effects after taking this product. “After drinking this product, I had some gurgling in my stomach,” she said. “I didn’t feel uncomfortable or bloated but noticed my stomach doing some aerobatics.” She felt a little buzz with the 300 mg of caffeine, but wishes the formula had more beta-alanine for more of a tingly skin effect, which she loves. Kayla experienced slight tingles, but no hot face or itchiness, rating side effects as a 5 out of 5. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After mixing this product, she rated it a 5 out of 5. “I shook it for sixty seconds, and the product mixed in flawlessly. Sixty seconds of mixing is probably a little overkill, but it did well with not foaming up too much and there was zero product left behind swirling in the drink or at the bottom of the shaker.” 


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can’t beat the price of this product,” Kayla says. “If you are looking for something that tastes good, has a high caffeine percentage, and is affordable, this is the product for you.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workout for Beginners: Jacked Factory Nitrosurge&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Jacked Factory Nitrosurge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;A vegan formula with science-backed ingredients&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Jacked Factory Nitrosurge &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recommend Jacked Factory Nitrosurge for those new to pre-workouts. The energy boost is reliably smooth, and the packaging includes dosing information for both one scoop (beginners) and two scoops (more experienced users). Nitrosurge is ideal for simplicity, safety, and gradual dosing. This is why it’s our top pick for beginners seeking reliable pre-workout support. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete gave Jacked Factory Nitrosurge a 5 out of 5 for taste, particularly the Blue Raspberry flavor. “This product is very sweet and they use both natural and artificial flavors as well as both sucralose and acesulfame potassium to sweeten the product. 9/10 on sweetness.” Pete recommends adding a little extra water if the sweetness is too intense: “I would probably add a bit more water to cut the sweetness level in the future.”  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Nitrosurge froths slightly when mixing, Pete reported this quickly disappears, leaving a drink that’s “light and refreshing,” with the blue raspberry flavor especially “great but very sweet”. Overall, Pete’s experience highlights how this pre-workout appeals to those who enjoy vibrant flavors and appreciate options to adjust sweetness to their preference. 


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete’s experience with Jacked Factory Nitrosurge’s side effects was solid but not perfect, resulting in a 3 out of 5 rating for this category. He noted, “When using the 2-scoop serving size, this product is well-dosed. The main ingredients are caffeine, L-citrulline, L-theanine, beta-alanine, betaine anhydrous, and Con-Cret Creatine HCl.” Pete appreciated the dosing overall but had reservations about caffeine: “I like the dosages of the ingredients in the 2-scoop serving size aside from the amount of caffeine, the two-scoop dose provides 360 mg of caffeine which is a lot.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the presence of L-theanine, intended to smooth out caffeine’s effects, Pete still reported, “I still had a little bit of the jitters after taking this high of a dose of caffeine.” He also commented on the creatine content: “The 2 grams of creatine is a ‘nice to have’ but isn’t a fully effective 5-gram dose, so you would still need to supplement additionally if creatine is part of your normal routine.” Pete added, “In my opinion, creatine doesn’t need to be in a pre-workout and if it is included, it should be the full 5-gram dose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="9"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Pete’s experience suggests Nitrosurge performs well for most users, but beginners should be cautious with the higher caffeine dose and start with a single scoop.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Tasting Pre-Workout: Kaged Pre-Workout Sport&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Kaged Pre-Workout Sport&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kaged Pre-Workout Sport stands out as our pick for best tasting pre-workout, praised by our tester Pete for its sweetness and smooth texture. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flavor earns a strong 5 out of 5 rating, primarily due to its sweet profile and clean finish. As Pete noted, “This product is very sweet (8/10), using sucralose, but I think it tastes great and is refreshing. The Blue Raspberry flavor definitely comes through.” The texture is equally impressive: “The mouth feel is smooth and light, not gritty at all, and doesn’t get foamy when mixed.” Pete added, “I like the flavor and sweetness level based on the directions when mixed in 12 oz. of water.” These qualities make Kaged Pre-Workout Sport a top choice for those who value excellent taste, reliable mixability, and a refreshing pre-workout experience. 


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kaged Pre-Workout as best pre-workout supplement" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=256&amp;amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kaged-Pre.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=85"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete also rated this product a 5 out of 5 for side effects, as it stands out as a reliable, gentle and well-balanced option for users seeking clean energy and hydration. “I didn’t experience any side effects or digestive issues. And no weird aftertaste,” Pete said, highlighting that this pre-workout avoided common issues like stomach upset or lingering bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="11"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tester notes that it’s a “moderately dosed pre-workout that also focuses on hydration with the addition of mineral electrolytes and coconut fruit water powder.” It also includes 3.5 grams of L-citrulline, 1.6 grams of beta-alanine, and 1.25 grams of betaine anhydrous. While the beta-alanine is slightly underdosed per Pete, both the L-citrulline and betaine are provided in effective dosages.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The caffeine is 188 mg per serving which Pete says “works well for a product intended for sports rather than weightlifting.” That being said, we recommend Kaged’s Pre-Workout Sport for folks who are playing sports, not powerlifting. For powerlifting athletes, we suggest Transparent Labs Bulk.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workout for Athletes: Pre Lab Pro Pre-Workout&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Pre Lab Pro Pre-Workout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;A nootropic formula that’s naturally berry flavored&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Pre Lab Pro Pre-Workout &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pre Lab Pro Pre-Workout is a vegan pre-workout that stands out for its moderate amounts of caffeine and clean ingredient profile. Plus, it’s also&lt;a href="https://sport.wetestyoutrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://sport.wetestyoutrust.com/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; Informed Sport certified,&lt;/a&gt; meaning it’s free of banned substances and ideal for athletes.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre Lab Pro Pre-Workout excels in both mixability and taste, earning a 5 out of 5 for each category. Pete tested this product, saying, “It dissolved easily. There were no chunks and no further shaking required,” highlighting how the powder blends swiftly and effortlessly into water without grittiness or residue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="13"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its sweetness also scores top marks: “This product has a moderate sweetness level, and I believe is true to its ‘Natural Berry’ flavor. It doesn’t taste artificial in nature and is lightly sweetened with a combination of monk fruit extract, stevia, and erythritol.” The result is a drink that’s pleasantly balanced, authentic to its berry profile, and suitable for those preferring a natural, non-artificial taste experience.  


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete also rated the side effects a 5 out of 5, making it an excellent option for athletes who want to avoid common pre-workout discomforts. “The formula favors natural ingredients like the red beet root powder,” making it suitable for those prioritizing clean, plant-based products and those who want to avoid high stimulant levels.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Pete did note, “This product is incredibly underdosed for the price point.” That said, our RD tester thinks it excels in tolerability and safety. In fact, “no digestive issues, aftertastes, or any other issues when using this product” were reported, confirming its reputation as a well-formulated pre-workout without unpleasant side effects.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Clean Pre-Workout: Naked Nutrition Naked Energy&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Naked Nutrition Naked Energy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;A vegan-friendly pre-workout with no artificial sweeteners or flavors&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Naked Nutrition Naked Energy &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Naked Nutrition Naked Energy is a minimalist pre-workout supplement, making it our pick for best clean pre-workout, thanks to its simple, pure ingredients without additives, artificial flavoring, or excess sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="15"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This product earned a 5 out of 5 for mixability. “It dissolved well, leaving no chunks or undissolved pre-workout,” Pete said. This supplement blends quickly and completely, leaving a clear solution in the shaker bottle without residue or separation, making it hassle-free to prepare and consume. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On taste, Pete rates it 3 out of 5, noting: “This is an unflavored product, it doesn’t taste like much. You can tell something is in the shaker bottle but there’s no distinct flavor and it’s not sweet at all.” The unflavored variant offers a neutral profile, which may be ideal for those seeking simplicity, but could potentially be less appealing to folks who prefer a sweet or strong taste. 


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete rated Naked Nutrition Naked Energy a 5 out of 5 for side effects, describing it as “a very mild pre-workout that provides 200 mg of caffeine but only 2 grams of beta-alanine, 1 gram of creatine, and 1 gram of L-arginine, all three of which are underdosed and won’t provide much benefit based on the scientific literature.” He remarked, “I did notice the caffeine, but it’s a lackluster pre-workout formula overall—but may work well for beginners or people just looking for something caffeinated before their workout.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This product’s underdosed formula means you are unlikely to experience unpleasant reactions typically associated with higher-stimulant pre-workouts, making it ideal for those seeking a clean, straightforward option. Pete concluded that it is an “underdosed formula aside from the caffeine,” highlighting its mild nature and absence of negative side effects during his testing, which is why it earned top marks in this category. If you’d like a more complex pre-workout with stronger effects, we recommend trying out Nutricost’s Pre-X Pre-Workout.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workout for Weight Loss: Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="product-card-inline-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="card-area-1"&gt;
&lt;h4 class="card-title"&gt;Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;section class="card-intro"&gt;Contains ingredients to support an increased metabolic rate and focus&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Cellucor C4 Pre-Workout &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cellucor C4 stands out as a good choice for those who want some potential fat loss benefits, as it includes&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; L-carnitine&lt;/a&gt; and Capsimax®&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5426284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5426284/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; cayenne extract&lt;/a&gt;, both of which may help support calorie burn during workouts. With 150 mg of caffeine, it provides a noticeable but manageable energy boost—ideal for maintaining stamina without a crash.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete had a great first impression of Cellucor C4, rating it a 5 out of 5. “The product has a custom-made lid with the C4 logo etched into it. The logo itself has a glossy finish and text is a metallic silver. It’s definitely an eye-catching design. The container is very standard for pre-workouts and is travel friendly. It opens and closes easily, and the scoop is provided.” 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tester rated this pre-workout 5 out of 5 both for mixability and for taste, praising its ease of preparation and enjoyable flavor profile. For mixability, he notes, “It dissolved quickly and easily. It has a smooth consistency, no chunks, and no foam.” This quick and effortless blending ensures a drink that can be ready to consume in seconds and that provides a pleasant texture throughout.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On taste, Pete says: “I thought this pre-workout tasted pretty good, I could taste the mango flavor but there were other flavors there as well, such as pineapple and strawberry.” 


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He described the flavor as distinctly tropical and found it very sweet. He said, “This product was fairly sweet when mixed using the twelve fluid ounces as directed.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="19"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete recommends adjusting to taste: “After my initial test, I ended up adding about 20 ounces of water and found it tasted pretty good at that point, with a moderate level of sweetness. This pre-workout uses both sucralose and acesulfame potassium to sweeten it, which results in a sweet taste.” Overall, he concludes that it “mixed great, the flavor was light and refreshing, it was just a bit too sweet, which is why I added a little extra water.”  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When testing, Pete remarked, “I took this before a morning workout and the 300 mg of caffeine was definitely noticeable. I trained for about one hour and had solid energy throughout the workout and was able to stay mentally engaged as well.” Notably, Pete didn’t experience any digestive issues or weird aftertaste when using this product, rating it a 5 out of 5 for side effects.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Best Pre-Workout for Muscle Gain: Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Our Thoughts on Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout is a well-balanced supplement for those seeking increased muscle gain, reliable energy, and added performance, thanks to the inclusion of creatine.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete tested out Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard Pre-Workout, rating it a 5 out of 5 for both mixability and taste, citing its impressively smooth blending and enjoyable sweetness. For mixability, he says, “It mixed easily in sixty seconds, leaving behind no chunks or clumping.” The texture stayed smooth throughout, with “no foam or froth when mixed and it’s a light texture,” making for an easy-to-drink pre-workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="21"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of flavor, Pete describes the product as “pretty sweet, just on the border of being too sweet, but not quite.” He also says, “This pre-workout is sweetened with both sucralose and acesulfame potassium.” To fine tune the taste, Pete made some modifications: “I added a bit of additional water to help balance out the flavor.” Overall, he found the flavor “light and refreshing” with the level of sweetness being a personal preference that can be easily adjusted. He rated the sweetness a 3 out of 5. 


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete’s overall thoughts on this pre-workout are that it’s moderately dosed, which is good for folks who are new to using pre-workout or who don’t want a high-stim product. He didn’t experience any side effects such as stomach upset, and there was no aftertaste.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Other Pre-Workouts We Tested &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We tested over a dozen pre-workout supplements hands-on in our lab. Here are a few that we considered but didn’t make our list of top picks, and why. 



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How We Tested and Selected the Best Pre-Workouts &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We tested and evaluated pre-workout supplements and scored them on a scale of 1-5 for factors such as first impressions, directions that are easily understood, taste, mixing, side effects, and value. Our testers evaluate the products based on their own individual experiences and preferences. We then review their testing feedback and data to share our findings and recommendations with you.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Taste and Texture &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flavor is an important part of our testing process. We ask our testers to provide feedback on the taste, texture, and pleasantness of the flavor of each pre-workout supplement. We rate sweetness on a scale of 1 to 5, based on how strong the sweetness is. A score of 5 is best-tasting, 1 is not drinkable. We also consider texture, and ask our tester to record any grittiness, clumps, frothiness, or conversely, smoothness and creaminess, when tasting the mixed pre-workout drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="23"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Formula &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We work with a registered dietitian (RD) during testing to find the most effective and safe pre-workout formulas. We primarily focus on pre-workout supplements without artificial sweeteners and other additives, while prioritizing clinically dosed formulations. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mixability  &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When mixing pre-workout into a liquid, we prepare the product exactly as advised by the brand. We then pay close attention to how well the powder dissolves, wanting to avoid grittiness in the taste and odd textures, like chunks. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Third-Party Testing &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We chose pre-workout supplements that have been third-party tested. Third-party testing ensures independent verification of safety, purity, as well as nutrition label accuracy. This helps to reduce the risk of mislabeling or underdosing. Third-party testing also checks for harmful substances such as heavy metals, pesticides, and more for safety. For athletes, third-party testing is paramount to knowing that the pre-workout they’ve chosen does not contain any banned substances. Independent testing and certifications help to build consumer trust. The FDA (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.fda.gov/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;) does not regulate supplements, so it’s vital to have independent testing done to ensure safety, accuracy, and quality. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Value &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When considering value, we place a higher value on brands that source their ingredients in America and have certifications, such as Informed Choice.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to Find the Best Pre-Workout for You &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone has different pre-workout supplement needs depending on your fitness goals, dietary needs, allergies, and pre-existing health conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="25"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to consider when selecting the best pre-workout for you. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Your Fitness Goals &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each person and athlete has unique fitness goals, whether it’s building muscle, burning fat, boosting energy, or improving endurance and strength. Because of this, the ideal pre-workout supplement will differ from person to person. To find the best pre-workout for your needs, consider your training intensity, performance goals, and tolerance to stimulants. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Flavors &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to choose a pre-workout flavor that you genuinely enjoy, because drinking it consistently can make your training routine feel more enjoyable and sustainable. A great-tasting pre-workout turns your workouts into something you can look forward to, helping you stay committed over time. Finding flavors you like, from fruity blends to candy-inspired options, can make it easier to stick to your fitness routine and support your performance goals. 


&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Formula &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to check a pre-workout’s ingredient list and formula before purchasing. Pre-workouts can vary widely in their blends of caffeine, amino acids, boosters, and focus enhancers. Some are high-stimulant for maximum energy, while others are stimulant-free for those who are sensitive or prefer training later in the day. There are also formulas tailored for endurance, strength training, or general performance.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cost &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pre-workout supplements can be expensive, so it’s smart to consider your budget when choosing one for regular use. Formulas with cleaner ingredients, such as those without artificial sweeteners, fillers, or unnecessary additives often cost more due to their quality and ingredient sourcing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="27"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Third-Party Testing &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third-party testing independently verifies the safety, purity, and label accuracy of pre-workout supplements since the&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.fda.gov/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; FDA&lt;/a&gt; does not regulate them. This process helps protect you from mislabeling, contamination, and banned substances, while also building trust and giving you confidence in what you’re taking. Independent testing is a key factor in confirming product quality and safeguarding your health. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Benefits of Pre-Workout &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947244/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947244/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; pre-workout supplement&lt;/a&gt; before exercise may help provide a noticeable boost to both your physical performance and mental drive. These supplements are designed to help you power through tough training sessions by helping enhance energy, focus, and endurance so you can get the most out of every workout. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased energy:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-workouts often contain ingredients like caffeine that can provide an increase in energy, helping stimulate the body and mind.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental clarity and concentration are essential for effective workouts. Caffeine can helps with alertness and focus, while&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923098001634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923098001634" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; tyrosine&lt;/a&gt; may support endurance and makes workouts seem less intense. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muscle gain:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-workout may make it easier to train at higher intensities, which over time helps with muscle growth and strength. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What to Avoid in Pre-Workout &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some pre-workout supplements contain unnecessary or even harmful ingredients that might outweigh the benefits. Knowing what to watch out for helps you choose a cleaner, safer option for your workouts. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial sweeteners:&lt;/strong&gt; Many pre-workouts use artificial sweeteners for flavor, which can cause digestive discomfort in some people and may have questionable&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; long-term health effects&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fillers:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-quality supplements sometimes include fillers that add bulk but have no real benefit, reducing their effectiveness. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;






&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added sugar: &lt;/strong&gt;Excess sugar may give a quick energy boost but could cause you to crash later. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proprietary blends: &lt;/strong&gt;Some products group ingredients into proprietary blends, which hide individual dosages. This lack of transparency makes it hard to know if you’re getting effective amounts or underdosed ingredients. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential Negative Effects of Pre-Workout &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the potential negative effects of pre-workout include jitters, rapid heartbeat, headaches, digestive upset, or trouble sleeping. High doses of caffeine, a common ingredient in many pre-workout formulas, may also cause feelings of&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10867825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10867825/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; anxiety and restlessness&lt;/a&gt;. Other ingredients such as beta-alanine may lead to a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4501114/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; temporary tingling sensation&lt;/a&gt; on the skin. This tingling is harmless, but may be surprising or uncomfortable for new users. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize the risk of negative effects, it’s best to start with a smaller amount rather than taking a full serving. Beginning with half, or even a quarter, of the recommended dose allows your body to adjust and gives you a chance to see how your body responds. From there, you can gradually increase the dose as needed until you find the right balance for you without unwanted side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="29"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who Should Not Take Pre-Workout Supplements &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have any preexisting conditions or health history, it’s always best to consult a doctor before trying out a new supplement, pre-workout included. Folks with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, or anxiety disorders may want to avoid taking a pre-workout supplement, as stimulants like caffeine and other ingredients can make these conditions worse. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also avoid these supplements. Additionally, people under eighteen years old should also avoid stimulant-based pre-workouts.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Frequently asked questions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best pre-workout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparent Labs Bulk is our top choice for overall best pre-workout thanks to its scientifically backed formula and properly dosed ingredients. Each serving provides 275 mg of caffeine, balanced with 200 mg of L-Theanine to help minimize jitters and anxiety. You’ll also get 4,000 mg of beta-alanine, enough to support endurance and muscle pump.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should I take pre-workout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to take your pre-workout about twenty to thirty minutes before exercising to give the ingredients time to kick in. This timing helps maximize energy, focus, and endurance during your workout. If your supplement contains stimulants such as caffeine, it’s a good idea to avoid taking it too close to bedtime to prevent sleep disruption.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does pre-workout actually help? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4947244/" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; 2016 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that taken prior to exercise, a caffeine-containing pre-workout dietary supplement may help improve anaerobic performance. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is pre-workout healthy to take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-workout supplements can be safe for most folks when taken as recommended and chosen from reputable brands with clear ingredient labeling. They often contain well-studied ingredients like caffeine and creatine, which can boost energy and workout performance for many people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="31"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to avoid taking pre-workout if you are under eighteen, have a heart condition, or high blood pressure. It’s also important to check that the product has been tested by a third party and does not contain any banned or unapproved substances, since these supplements are not regulated by the FDA.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;



&lt;details class="wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much caffeine is safe to consume in a day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main elements of a pre-workout is typically caffeine, so it’s smart to make sure your daily consumption isn’t exceeding recommended amounts—especially if you enjoy a morning cup of coffee in addition. For most adults, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" class="sc-4f49155c-0 hLtviE"&gt; up to 400 mg of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; in a day should be acceptable, however too much can be harmful.  



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the FDA also notes that people’s ability to tolerate caffeine can vary, and that certain medical conditions and medications can increase sensitivity to the stimulant. They go on to say that women who are pregnant, aiming to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding may wish to talk with their doctor about whether to limit caffeine. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 19:48:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5Bb0dRN3RPektXMkpsQXp5N3dLMHBCdWxTLXpPNW5oelFGLXE0NzRpWTRHbUMxLWsxQnpralNqbFZSUUwyMlVKN0FQNkNfdk5yVXdtdnQweXpGSG01T09QdE1PdEpCOXBf</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.在会议前几天为关键疫苗专家组ACIP增加了五名成员- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/kennedy-names-new-acip-members-cdc-vaccine-advisers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="isabella-cueto"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;Isabella Cueto covers the leading causes of death and disability: chronic diseases.

Kennedy Jr. on Monday, just days ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/03/childhood-vaccine-schedule-at-risk-rfk-cdc-turmoil/"&gt;the group’s next meeting&lt;/a&gt;. They include an infectious disease expert who has pushed back on Covid-19 mandates and another who advocated for alternative, unproven treatments for Covid, including ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/09/acip-kennedy-to-name-controversial-vaccine-advisers/"&gt;STAT previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the appointees were under consideration. Now, with their appointments, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is up to 12 members, a few short of the panel Kennedy dismissed in June, saying the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;move was necessary to restore trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta to consider and vote on recommendations related to Covid-19 vaccines and shots on the pediatric vaccine schedule, including &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;hepatitis B vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy had appointed the first batch of new members prior to the group’s meeting in June. That meeting cemented the reintroduction of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;decades-old anti-vaccine talking points&lt;/a&gt; in national policy, as the group recommended that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/23/kennedy-approves-acip-recommendation-thimerosal-removed-from-flu-vaccines/"&gt;preservative thimerosal be removed from vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/25/cdc-vaccines-advisory-committee-meeting-day-1/"&gt;review long-approved vaccines&lt;/a&gt; on the childhood immunization schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC director is typically responsible for approving recommendations or not, which may mean the responsibility will fall to the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/jim-oneill-cdc-acting-director/"&gt;CDC’s acting director, Jim O’Neill&lt;/a&gt;. O’Neill stepped into the role after Kennedy ousted former director &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; over vaccine policy disputes. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The new members are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirk Milhoan&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://driscollchildrens.org/doctors/kirk-a-milhoan-md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pediatric cardiologist&lt;/a&gt; at Driscoll Children’s Hospital in Texas. According to the HHS press release, he “holds a Ph.D. in the mechanisms of myocardial inflammation.” His &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt; on the website of the Independent Medical Alliance, a group formed in 2020 that has advocated for Covid treatments at odds with the medical mainstream, states he is dedicated to treating patients with “vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.” He has authored &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirk-Milhoan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two papers&lt;/a&gt; on Covid vaccines, including one that claimed the mRNA vaccines led to more cases of the heart condition myocarditis than the virus itself, and called for the shots to be pulled from the market. While the vaccines did lead to some cases of the condition, regulators around the world consider them to be safe and effective. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hillary Blackburn&lt;/strong&gt;, a pharmacist and director of medication access and affordability at the Catholic health system Ascension. She previously founded and ran a consulting company for pharmacists and spent more than a decade with Dispensary of Hope, which sources medications that can be redistributed to low-income patients. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Griffin&lt;/strong&gt;, a Polish-born physician based in Baton Rouge, La. Her most recent venture appears to be an annual “health and wellness fair” called All Things Wellness. Griffin previously worked as an OB-GYN at Ochsner Health before transitioning to lifestyle and root-cause medicine, according to her online bios. According to HHS, “she was among the first robotic-assisted gynecologic surgeons in the U.S. and has led efforts to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.” She has promoted functional and naturopathic medicine, and &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2023-05-10/rape-and-incest-exceptions-voted-down-along-party-lines-in-louisiana-house-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;publicly supported&lt;/a&gt; abortion restrictions in her home state.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raymond Pollak&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/pub/raymond-pollak-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;physician in Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, who is also licensed to practice in Florida. Pollak was a whistleblower in a suit against the University of Illinois Hospital alleging that the hospital admitted patients for liver transplants when they &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/iln/chicago/2003/pr111703_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;were not medically necessary&lt;/a&gt;. The university paid a fine to resolve the case in 2003. According to HHS, he’s published more than 120 peer-reviewed articles and been a principal investigator on National Institutes of Health transplant biology grants and numerous drug trials. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Stein&lt;/strong&gt;, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. She is a Ph.D. scientist whose research focuses on tuberculosis, including genetic and environmental susceptibility, the genomics of resistance, and genetic variation in disease severity. According to HHS, she has published 115 peer-reviewed articles. She may be better known in Ohio for her testimony before state legislative committees opposing Covid vaccine mandates. Stein submitted remarks at a meeting early in the pandemic considering whether to make public &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20489546-cathy-stein-hb-90-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Covid data&lt;/a&gt; on testing, cases, and deaths. A year later she supported a bill that would &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20489546-cathy-stein-hb-90-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prohibit vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
