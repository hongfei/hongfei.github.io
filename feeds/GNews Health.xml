&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üî¨ Scientists at King‚Äôs College London have developed a revolutionary &lt;strong&gt;nanoneedle patch&lt;/strong&gt; that is thinner than a human hair, enabling painless biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíâ The patch collects detailed &lt;strong&gt;molecular information&lt;/strong&gt; from tissues without cutting or scarring, offering a non-invasive alternative to traditional biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üß† This innovation could transform &lt;strong&gt;disease diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt; and monitoring, particularly for conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs, through real-time molecular analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ü§ù Developed through interdisciplinary collaboration, the patch promises faster, more accurate medical decisions, heralding a new era of &lt;strong&gt;personalized medicine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biopsies have long been a necessary but often painful procedure for diagnosing various medical conditions. However, a revolutionary new development from scientists at King‚Äôs College London promises to change this narrative. A microscopic patch, bristling with nanoneedles and thinner than a human hair, offers a pain-free alternative to traditional biopsies. This breakthrough could transform how diseases like cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs are diagnosed and monitored, eliminating the need for invasive procedures that often involve scalpels and needles. The potential implications for patient care and medical diagnostics are profound and far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Revolutionary Patch: A Leap in Medical Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanoneedle-studded patch represents a significant advancement in medical technology. Unlike traditional biopsies that require removing tissue samples, this patch painlessly collects detailed molecular data from tissues without cutting or scarring. The patch‚Äôs nanoneedles are roughly 1,000 times thinner than a human hair, allowing them to extract molecular ‚Äúfingerprints‚Äù such as lipids, proteins, and mRNA directly from living cells. This method offers an unprecedented level of detail and accuracy in molecular diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed through a collaboration involving experts in nanoengineering, clinical oncology, cell biology, and artificial intelligence, this patch could revolutionize personalized medicine. By providing a real-time window into disease progression and treatment response, it allows for more accurate and timely medical decisions. The ability to sample the same tissue multiple times, without destroying it, is a significant advancement over traditional biopsy techniques. This innovation holds promise for improving outcomes for patients with complex conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZEcurf0NMO"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/quantum-laws-just-got-twisted-u-s-engineers-use-entangled-light-to-project-mind-bending-3d-holograms-in-real-time/"&gt;‚ÄúQuantum Laws Just Got Twisted‚Äù: U.S. Engineers Use Entangled Light to Project Mind-Bending 3D Holograms in Real Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming Disease Monitoring and Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this nanoneedle patch extend beyond mere diagnostics. It could fundamentally change how diseases are tracked and treated. By enabling frequent, non-invasive sampling, doctors can make faster, more informed decisions about surgeries and treatment plans. For instance, in brain surgery, the patch allows surgeons to quickly assess molecular data from suspicious areas, enabling more precise and targeted interventions. This capability reduces delays in treatment and improves surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch‚Äôs potential for integration into everyday medical devices, such as contact lenses and bandages, further enhances its utility. Manufactured using techniques similar to those used for computer chips, these nanoneedles can be mass-produced, making them accessible for widespread medical use. This innovation could soon bring diagnosis and monitoring directly to the skin‚Äôs surface, offering a seamless and efficient way to manage health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rhjv9KfoTa"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/not-china-not-the-u-s-this-surprising-nation-now-tops-the-world-in-rd-spending-and-is-quietly-rewriting-the-innovation-map/"&gt;Not China, Not the U.S.: This Surprising Nation Now Tops the World in R&amp;amp;D Spending and Is Quietly Rewriting the Innovation Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative Efforts and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of this nanoneedle patch is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together experts from various fields, this project has achieved a breakthrough that could redefine medical diagnostics. In preclinical studies, the patch has already demonstrated its effectiveness on brain cancer tissue and mouse models, with promising results that suggest real-world applications are not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ciro Chiappini, the lead author of the study, emphasizes the patch‚Äôs potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis and monitoring. By offering a painless and efficient alternative to traditional biopsies, this technology could significantly improve patient experiences and outcomes. As the patch moves towards clinical application, it holds the promise of transforming how diseases are diagnosed and managed, making personalized medicine a tangible reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Era in Painless Diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the nanoneedle patch marks a significant step forward in the quest for painless medical diagnostics. As this technology continues to develop, it could lead to the end of painful biopsies, providing a safer and more comfortable experience for patients. The ability to diagnose and monitor diseases without invasive procedures opens new avenues for medical care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, published in Nature Nanotechnology, has garnered attention for its potential to change the landscape of medical diagnostics. By enabling faster and more accurate disease tracking, this technology could help doctors and patients make better, more informed decisions. As we move forward, the question remains: how will this breakthrough in nanotechnology reshape the future of personalized medicine and patient care?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The social media platform TikTok recently banned a hashtag called #SkinnyTok after European regulators warned it was promoting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/28/1263527105/steroids-men-body-image" target="_blank"&gt;unrealistic body images &lt;/a&gt;and extreme weight loss.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company had seen an onslaught of content featuring emaciated-looking young women peddling tips on how to drop weight quickly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now the hashtag may be gone, but eliminating this kind of harmful content is not that simple. There's still no shortage of people ‚Äî on TikTok and other social media platforms ‚Äî spreading unhealthy information on how to eat fewer calories and get very, very thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that consuming this type of content on social media &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5003636/" target="_blank"&gt;is correlated to&lt;/a&gt; a higher risk of disordered eating. Young women and girls are especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to nutrition and wellness, it can be hard to disentangle the unhealthy from the healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You have many kinds of content in the gray zones," says &lt;a href="https://www.brookeduffy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Brooke Erin Duffy&lt;/a&gt;, who studies social media and culture at Cornell University. "Their regulation is much more difficult."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creators are good at taking advantage of this murky ground, says Duffy. "As soon as there is an attempt for platforms to regulate or thwart a hashtag, anyone using the platform is gonna develop a workaround," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A popular meme called "What I eat in a day," for example, features people showing their daily food intake. Posts can either feature a balanced diet or one that could put someone in a dangerous calorie deficit. One young woman recently posted a video showing the single croissant she subsisted on in a day, whereas a different woman featured a balance of lean proteins and vegetables adding up to 1,800 calories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Body-positive counterprogramming&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some creators on the front lines of the body image battle are making their own counterprogramming. Athlete and creator Kate Glavan ‚Äî who has nearly 150,000 followers ‚Äî urges her followers to take seriously the dangers of content that glamorizes undernourishment.  She discusses her own struggle with an eating disorder in her videos.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of creators are explicitly promoting anorexia to their audience," Glavan says in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/7380018730572451115" target="_blank"&gt;a recent TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;. "It's dangerous. It's misinformed," she says, and she advises people to "block these creators."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that anorexia has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8429328/" target="_blank"&gt;the highest mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; of any psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But researchers who study this issue say &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1196978085/nprs-book-of-the-day-draft-10-17-2023" target="_blank"&gt;body-positive content&lt;/a&gt; doesn't garner the same kinds of audiences ‚Äî or profit. "Negative images that are unrealistic or show really thin people or really muscular people tend to have a more lasting impact than body-positive content&lt;strong&gt;," &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrisci.med.utoronto.ca/faculty/amanda-raffoul" target="_blank"&gt;says Amanda Raffoul,&lt;/a&gt; who researches eating disorders and social media at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Messaging that equates thinness with beauty is reinforced throughout society, Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul points to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015323000223" target="_blank"&gt; research that suggests&lt;/a&gt; consumption of body-positive content on social media does not necessarily provide protection against or counteract content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The way that they structure content and the way that they code algorithms to amplify certain types of messaging and even target certain types of messaging to specific users puts that information in the hands of more vulnerable people," Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though platforms aren't creating content, says Raffoul, they are responsible for how &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224955473/social-media-algorithm-filterworld" target="_blank"&gt;aggressively they amplify&lt;/a&gt; different kinds of messaging or direct it at certain demographics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;TikTok declined a request for an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement stressed that they "regularly review safety measures to address evolving risks and have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content." Searches on the platform for this term are redirected to the &lt;a href="https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/" target="_blank"&gt;National Alliance for Eating Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among other safety strategies, the company says it continues to restrict videos for teen accounts and redirect searches to health experts, as well as partner with advocacy groups that offer strategies around recognizing and treating eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A losing battle&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some body-positive warriors say the movement is having a low moment. "With the massive &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/13/1198912257/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-hollywood-body-positvity-future-us-obesity-shortage" target="_blank"&gt;rise of GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; and their widespread use as a quick fix weight loss solution, we've seen this return of the narrative that thin is back in," says &lt;a href="https://www.meganjaynecrabbe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Megan Jayne Crabbe,&lt;/a&gt; author of the recently published book &lt;em&gt;We Don't Make Ourselves Smaller Here. "&lt;/em&gt;The beauty standard has swung back towards extreme slimness," Crabbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;While Crabbe still creates content on social media, she says it's harder to break through with messaging that normalizes bigger bodies than it was a few years ago. She is glad to see #Skinnytok banned, but she says she sees a need for more soul searching on the question of beauty standards from Western culture.  "I think banning the hashtag is a surface-level plaster to a very deep wound," she says. "We are still deeply fat phobic as a society."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some content creators say the uphill battle against negative content around eating and skinny bodies is exhausting. "I don't really claim it anymore," says &lt;a href="https://the-dots.com/users/nyome-nicholas-williams-77718" target="_blank"&gt;Nyome Nicholas-Williams,&lt;/a&gt; of the term "body positivity." Nicholas-Williams ‚Äî a Black woman and a plus-size model ‚Äî says she feels pushed out of the movement that Black women started but she says has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9589104/#s3" target="_blank"&gt;been co-opted&lt;/a&gt;. "I'm more of like 'body neutrality,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Nicholas-Williams &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy" target="_blank"&gt;publicly took on&lt;/a&gt; the social media platform Instagram, accusing the company of censoring content featuring Black plus-size models with different standards than those it used to police content featuring white, slim people. The company issued an apology and pledged to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nicholas-Williams says some of her public criticism of the social media platform has likely cost her business, but she thinks speaking out against dangerous content is an important strategy in combating it.  "People speaking up and being brave," she says, "that's what it takes."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul, who studies nutrition and social media at the University of Toronto, says the profit should not be overlooked. "Every second, every minute that we spend on these platforms is being monetized," says Raffoul, who points out that eating disorders and ideals around unattainable thinness have been around for decades, but that social media platforms allow for a new delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul believes it will take lawmakers forcing change in order to create meaningful protection from dangerous content through these new channels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Until that happens, she says, the best strategy to combat it is not to look at it at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Two inches of arm drift are enough to nudge the reading into the danger zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crossover trial at Johns Hopkins now shows that a patient who lets an arm dangle may appear up to 7 millimeters of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/basic-information-about-mercury" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; higher than one whose arm rests on the exam‚Äëroom desk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That difference can tip a person‚Äôs blood pressure reading from ‚Äúelevated‚Äù into dangerous ‚Äústage‚ÄØ2‚Äù territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/tammy-mc-loughlin-brady/2704889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tammy Brady&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, of the &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, led the investigation that re‚Äëcreated three real‚Äëworld postures seen in clinics every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-designed"&gt;How the study was designed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic real checkup conditions, researchers asked each participant to walk for two minutes before every blood pressure reading. Then they rested for five minutes in a quiet room, seated with back and feet supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person went through four rounds of triplicate measurements using different arm positions. By repeating the desk-supported reading at the end, the team accounted for natural blood pressure shifts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-blood-pressure-can-fool-us"&gt;Why blood pressure can fool us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of U.S. adults live with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, the persistent elevation of arterial pressure that strains the heart and vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians rely on a single snapshot often taken in less than a minute, to decide whether to start lifelong medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 133 Baltimore volunteers aged 18 to 80 and rotated them through desk‚Äësupport, lap‚Äërest, and side‚Äëdangling positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used automated cuffs to remove observer bias and repeated the desk posture at the end to control for natural fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the desk standard, a lap‚Äësupported arm averaged 3.9‚ÄØmmHg higher &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systolic-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic&lt;/a&gt; and 4‚ÄØmmHg higher &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-look-at-diastolic-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diastolic&lt;/a&gt;.

It‚Äôs common to see rushed exams where patients hold their own arms or sit on exam tables without support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shortcuts might seem minor in the moment, but repeated over time, they add up. Misreadings can creep into charts, shape diagnoses, and affect treatment plans that last for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIf you are consistently measuring blood pressure with an unsupported arm, and that gives you an overestimated BP of 6.5‚ÄØmmHg, that‚Äôs a potential difference between a systolic BP of 123 and 130,‚Äù warned &lt;a href="https://globalhypertensionathopkins.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sherry Liu, M.H.S.&lt;/a&gt;, referencing the clinical jump from ‚Äúelevated‚Äù to ‚Äústage‚ÄØ1‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held in younger and older adults, in people with and without &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-childhood-obesity-rate-is-expected-to-soar-by-2050/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, and in those already diagnosed with high pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-properly-take-blood-pressure"&gt;How to properly take blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desk‚Äëlevel support keeps the cuff‚Äôs mid‚Äëpoint at mid‚Äëheart height, equalizing hydrostatic pressure along the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the arm, and gravity demands a higher force to push blood upward, so the gauge records extra pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/11/09/where-and-how-you-sit-matters-when-getting-blood-pressure-taken-at-the-doctors-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; instructs nurses to seat patients in a backed chair, feet flat, legs uncrossed, and arm resting on a firm surface that aligns with the right atrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even well-trained clinicians don‚Äôt always follow textbook guidelines. In busy offices, there‚Äôs pressure to move quickly, and details like arm height can get overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some providers might think close is good enough, but the research shows that ‚Äúalmost right‚Äù still leads to wrong numbers. Unless someone checks posture intentionally, errors can become routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-home-monitors-need-help"&gt;At‚Äëhome monitors need help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions measure at home, yet many kitchen tables are too low to mimic clinic desks. A pillow under the elbow or sliding the device onto a higher counter can close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuff size matters as well; sleeves that are too narrow can push readings 5‚ÄØto‚ÄØ10‚ÄØmmHg higher, a problem affecting about 12‚ÄØpercent of Black Americans with larger &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.23473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arm circumferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-technique-leads-to-misdiagnosis"&gt;Poor technique leads to misdiagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small inaccuracies in readings can have a big impact on a person‚Äôs health journey.

Proper positioning is not just about data quality ‚Äì it can change real-life decisions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady‚Äôs team plans to test whether a simple reminder on the device screen: ‚ÄúRest arm on table‚Äù nudges behavior in primary‚Äëcare offices. They also want to see whether the error shrinks with wrist cuffs that use built‚Äëin position sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‚Äëhealth specialists hope standard positioning can prevent thousands of unnecessary prescriptions each year, reducing side effects and costs without compromising cardiovascular safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2824754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 02:50:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUjhvY3NGUnI4TW1fVmNQZm5XV3ptdXBGNlFVc2ctMDFOZUdCSmpMLXdFYzdLY2xiUXBsdExaWWZlQXdNa1BxZ094Qmh5dFhOd0had3BvWjVaYVRjLVFuQXpDSzVRTGV4dDRtRWxxNlhGcVEtTUZwSDRLUUpqakhFZWpkeE9jRHQ1YkNSbVR2ekdVZUpidmk2dlVBQWFWWFJlRm96WmZZT3N4UFBxbl9UcQ</guid></item><item><title>FDAÊ†πÊçÆÁäπ‰ªñÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÁîüÁâ©ÂåñÂ≠¶ÂÆ∂ÁöÑÂèëÁé∞ÊâπÂáÜHIVËçØÁâ©- KSLÊñ∞Èóª | FDA approves HIV drug based on University of Utah biochemist's findings - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOa0UwaHhxNG4welhPazFISTJPUjhXRFNadTVmdlVOZjhORExkdjEtemZzMDRrLVF5NS1rS1oyS0Fha1dnTko2c2ZuQUNDZWVDUUk3VS1WM3g5QkZrYU9hTmxscnBBSEdMbnpCUG4zRkFsRGZDNzRzRWFWdzJVNFJ2UEtLTnVfSHZ5bnlvWmoxekZjVnRtTnZMaUZ0UUdVMUNqa3dFZktkUDhXN00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY ‚Äî University of Utah biochemist Wesley Sundquist achieved yet another milestone last week when the Food and Drug Administration approved an antiviral drug for HIV prevention based on his findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundquist's lab at the U. laid the foundation for the development of a highly effective, long-lasting prophylactic ‚Äî or preventive measure ‚Äî against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting drug ‚Äî lenacapavir ‚Äî was developed by California-based pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences and has since been named the &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51214009" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;"Breakthrough of the Year"&lt;/a&gt; by Science, a top scientific journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the FDA's decision will make the drug, which is being marketed under the brand name Yeztugo, available in the U.S., where 31,000 people are infected with HIV every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sundquist's work that led to the drug dates back to the late '90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By purifying and analyzing the protein shell that surrounds the virus' genetic material, Sundquist's team discovered what the shell looks like and how it's put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a crucial step, the research team found that the virus' shell is highly sensitive to changes. Making even small tweaks to the proteins that make up the shell stopped the virus from replicating as quickly, which suggested that drugs that affect the protein shell could prove to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was these insights that caught the attention of Gilead Sciences, prompting the company to search for drugs that target HIV's protein shell ‚Äî otherwise known as a capsid ‚Äî tapping Sundquist as a consultant and eventually leading to the development of lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug itself binds the viral protein shell of HIV, preventing it from assembling properly and productively entering the nucleus of host cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more potent than any drug available, but more importantly, it's very long-lasting. So what the Phase 3 clinical trials show is that it completely protects people from transmission for six months," Sundquist said. "There are still 1.3 million new infections worldwide, and this could really change that trajectory. Of course, the rollout has to be funded and be successful, but right now there's no reason to think this won't have a major impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other HIV drugs, lenacapavir is noteworthy due to its potential for preventing HIV entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, about 40 million people live with HIV and the virus is responsible for 600,000 deaths annually, according to data from the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gileads-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa and Uganda ‚Äî two HIV hot spots ‚Äî not one of the more than 2,000 women who received a dose of lenacapavir contracted HIV over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenacapavir almost completely prevents the transmission of HIV into at-risk populations," Sundquist said. "This is just an amazing result."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approving the drug is just another notch in Sundquist's belt, as he was also &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/2025-warren-alpert-prize-honors-scientists-whose-discoveries-culminated-novel-hiv-treatment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; the 2025 Warren Alpert Prize from Harvard University last week. In April, Sundquist was named as one of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51296173" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's&lt;/a&gt; 100 most influential people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view ourselves as sort of the feedstock for new ways of approaching medicine," Sundquist said. "We're driven by curiosity to discover things that we don't understand. And I think that's not so different from other kinds of adventurers. The same thing that drives people to discover or climb mountains, I think, drives us to discover how a molecular machine works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the recent success, Sundquist remains driven, saying the work on HIV is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still need a vaccine. That would be even better because then you could give everyone the vaccine and protect everyone, not just at-risk individuals," Sundquist said. "That's been a very difficult problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

By recording activity in tens of thousands of neurons, scientists found that the visual cortex builds internal models of the environment, preparing the brain for future tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unsupervised learning occurs without any instruction, helping animals learn goal-oriented tasks faster later on. The study highlights how both unsupervised and supervised learning operate in parallel within the brain, reshaping our understanding of how we acquire knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain encodes environmental features even without tasks, aiding future learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Cortex Roles:&lt;/strong&gt; Distinct regions of the visual cortex handle exploratory (unsupervised) and task-based (supervised) learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Task Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice exposed to unstructured environments learned reward-linked tasks more quickly than unexposed peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aimlessly wandering around a city or exploring the new mall may seem unproductive, but new research from HHMI‚Äôs Janelia Research Campus suggests it could play an important role in how our brains learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simultaneously recording the activity of tens of thousands of neurons, a team of scientists from the Pachitariu and Stringer labs discovered that learning may occur even when there are no specific tasks or goals involved. ¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The¬†new research¬†finds that as animals explore their environment, neurons in the visual cortex‚Äîthe brain area responsible for processing visual information‚Äîencode visual features to build an internal model of the world. This information can speed up learning when a more concrete task arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEven when you are zoning out or just walking around or you don‚Äôt think you are doing anything special or hard, your brain is probably still working hard to help you memorize where you are, organizing the world around you, so that when you‚Äôre not zoning out anymore‚Äîwhen you actually need to do something and pay attention‚Äîyou‚Äôre ready to do your best,‚Äù says Janelia Group Leader Marius Pachitariu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observing unsupervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by postdoc Lin Zhong, designed experiments where mice ran in linear virtual reality corridors featuring various visual textures, akin to real-world environments. Some textures were linked to rewards, while others were not. After the mice learned the rules of an experiment, Zhong made subtle adjustments, altering the textures and the presence of rewards. ¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of running these experiments, the team observed changes in neural activity within the animals‚Äô visual cortex. However, they struggled to explain the observed neural plasticity‚Äîthe changes in connections between neurons that enable learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAs we thought more and more about it, we eventually ended up on the question of whether the task itself was even necessary,‚Äù Pachitariu says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs entirely possible that a lot of the plasticity happens just basically with the animal‚Äôs own exploration of the environment.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers explicitly tested this concept of unsupervised learning, they discovered that certain areas of the visual cortex were encoding visual features even without the animal being trained on a task. When a task was introduced, other areas of the cortex responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers found that mice exploring the virtual corridor for several weeks learned how to associate textures with rewards much faster than mice trained only on the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt means that you don‚Äôt always need a teacher to teach you: You can still learn about your environment unconsciously, and this kind of learning can prepare you for the future,‚Äù Zhong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI was very surprised. I have been doing behavioral experiments since my PhD, and I never expected that without training mice to do a task, you will find the same neuroplasticity.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding how brains learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings reveal distinct areas in the visual cortex are responsible for different types of learning: unstructured, exploration-based unsupervised learning and instructed, goal-oriented supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests that when animals learn a task, the brain might simultaneously use both algorithms‚Äîan unsupervised component to extract features and a supervised component to assign meaning to those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights could enhance our understanding of how learning occurs in the brain. While previous research on the visual cortex focused mainly on supervised learning, the new work opens new avenues for exploration, including how these different types of learning interact and how the visual model of the environment is integrated with spatial models from other brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a door to studying these unsupervised learning algorithms in the brain, and if that‚Äôs the main way by which the brain learns, as opposed to a more instructed, goal-directed way, then we need to study that part as well,‚Äù Pachitariu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say these insights were enabled both by Janelia‚Äôs support teams, which helped the researchers design and run the experiments, and by the mesoscope, an instrument that enabled the team to record up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously, enhancing their ability to make new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAllowing a single lab to run projects at this scale is what is uniquely possible here and that gives us the flexibility to pursue different questions without necessarily having a concrete plan,‚Äù Pachitariu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bddfd2d0cdd8c4d3fdd5d5d0d493d2cfda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey ‚Äì HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;‚Äú&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09180-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Unsupervised pretraining in biological neural networks&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù by Marius Pachitariu et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised pretraining in biological neural networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity, but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 21:26:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB5bGY5NE8xdWFhMzBFY2xsSlJZR21JbkR4LXdHX2dGbENvZl8wdEFCUkI0bE9qRzJqb0lxbS00YnN1RWFhUk53dlJNbzdkMjBSZERNX0dWOFZvQ0FFbTdjbmhrZjJZUGtxN0lJS202blZYb3NoeVYw</guid></item><item><title>Oura RingÁé∞Âú®ÂèØ‰ª•‰ΩøÁî®‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÊù•ÁõëÊµãË°ÄÁ≥ñÊ∞¥Âπ≥„ÄÇÊàëÊµãËØï‰∫Ü‰∏ÄÂë®ÔºåÂπ∂ÂæóÂà∞‰∫ÜËøô3‰∏™‰ª§‰∫∫ÊÉäËÆ∂ÁöÑÊî∂Ëé∑- CNET | Oura Ring Can Now Use AI to Monitor Blood Sugar Levels.

I'm constantly experimenting with the latest health tech, so I was naturally intrigued when I learned that Oura Ring partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/in-2024-biosensors-are-becoming-more-accessible-what-it-means-for-you/" target="_self"&gt;Dexcom's Stelo,&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/best-continuous-glucose-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt; designed for people without diabetes. The goal of this collaboration is to help everyday people like me understand how food and general eating habits &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;impact blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and overall health.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"By combining Stelo data with Oura's existing insights, we're empowering members to better understand the cause-and-effect relationships between eating patterns, energy, mood and recovery -- and ultimately make sustainable, science-backed lifestyle changes," Maz Brumand, vice president of product for Oura, told CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested the Stelo CGM with my Oura Ring for two weeks, and I can say that it changed the way I eat and move, and I think this type of biofeedback is helpful for everyone, even if you do not have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is continuous glucose monitoring, and why is it important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the measurement of sugar in your blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23509-glycogen" target="_self"&gt;glucose is the main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for your body -- it's what powers your muscles, brain and even your cells. When you eat certain foods (particularly carbohydrates), your glucose rises, and your body responds by releasing insulin to shuttle that sugar into cells for energy or storage. On the flip side, if you experience frequent spikes or crashes (even if you don't have diabetes ), it can impact your energy, sleep, mood and even long-term metabolic health. When your body doesn't need glucose immediately, it &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539802/" target="_self"&gt;stores it as glycogen&lt;/a&gt; in your muscles and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, monitoring glucose levels is crucial. But is it important to do the same for the rest of us without a diagnosis? To an extent, I think so. Monitoring your blood sugar throughout the day and seeing how your body reacts to different foods can reveal a lot about your cravings, sleep and metabolic health. "Glucose is a real-time window into metabolic health, which underpins how we feel day to day -- our energy, focus, mood and sleep -- and how resilient we are over time," Brumand says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of wearable glucose sensors like Stelo, those without diabetes can now get insights into how their eating habits impact their bodies (without finger pricks or a prescription).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a 'normal' glucose range, and are spikes bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using a CGM, I thought blood sugar was either stable or erratic, with no room for in-between spikes. Once I began tracking my glucose daily, I quickly learned that spikes are completely normal, especially after meals and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will see glucose levels rise and drop throughout the day. According to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, a general target range for adults without pre-diabetes or diabetes is between &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;70 and 140mg/dL&lt;/a&gt; (note that Oura also follows this range, and it's what users can expect to see in their graphs). It's also worth highlighting that 70 to 100mg/dL is considered normal for fasting (particularly in the morning before having food), and under 140 mg/dL is common, especially after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical studies show that even in healthy individuals, a moderate glucose spike (rise above 140mg/dL) can occur on a daily basis. In fact, research suggests that healthy adults will live above 140mg/dL for about 30 minutes, up to 2 hours a day, which is usually 1 to 3 short-lived glucose spikes", says¬†&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneefitton" target="_self"&gt;Renee Fitton&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and director of education at¬†&lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/l-nutra/org-chart/renee-fitton-ms-rd" target="_self"&gt;L-Nutra&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that the number and frequency of glucose spikes depend on various factors, primarily what and when you're eating. These spiked can also be affected by other factors like stress level, exercise, dehydration and even whether you have a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many glucose monitors use a custom range that adapts to your body's baseline and patterns over time. When looking at your graph, it's important to keep in mind that context and trends matter more than one-off spikes. For example, seeing a spike after dessert isn't a sign that something is wrong. It's a sign that your body is doing its job. What matters most is how quickly your glucose returns to baseline and how often your levels stay elevated over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not see signs for concern for occasional (one to three times per day) moderate spikes (less than 160mg/dL) that resolve within about 30 mins. When reaching more frequent, especially if they are higher spikes (for example, above 180mg/dL), that take a long time to resolve (over 60 minutes), then there may be concerns about metabolic health," Fitton explained. "A completely flat glucose curve is not something that we aim for; you want some gentle ups and downs as a sign of healthy metabolic flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I set up the Stelo monitor with my Oura Ring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order the Stelo sensor through &lt;a href="http://ouraring.com" target="_self"&gt;ouraring.com&lt;/a&gt; ($99 for two sensors). I received a small box with the sensors and easy instructions. Applying it to the back of my upper arm took less than 2 minutes and was surprisingly painless. And yes, there is a small needle involved. I'm terrified of needles, so I spent some time mentally preparing to prick myself, but to my disbelief, I didn't feel it at all. The sound the ejector makes is pretty loud, though. I sometimes think the sound acted as a diversion to my brain, and that's why I didn't feel anything. But, nonetheless, it was a pretty pain-free experience. Once in place, I paired it to the Stelo app, and it automatically reflected within the Oura app. Each sensor tracks your glucose level 24/7 for up to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left Image: CGM in the self-injector.

You can easily access it at the top of the app, where you also see other data metrics like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-chest-strap-heart-rate-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, activity and readiness score (a personalized score, ranging from 0 to 100, that provides a snapshot of how well your body has recovered from the previous day's activities and sleep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How even my 'healthy' food choices raised my blood sugar (and that's OK)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eye-opening parts of my testing was seeing how some of my favorite healthy staples played out on the glucose graph. A great example of this was my favorite pressed juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a pressed juice in the morning that contained pineapple, beets, carrots, ginger, cucumber and lemon. It's nutrient-dense, but it also spiked my glucose above what's considered my healthy range for about 6¬† minutes (a small window and still considered optimal for my age and overall metabolic health). This was enough to make me rethink how and when I consume fruit-heavy beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I experimented with having a fruit smoothie instead of juice. I made a homemade smoothie with berries, banana, plant-based protein powder, peanut butter, soy milk and oats. This smoothie kept my glucose completely in range (zero minutes above my personal threshold). The added protein and fiber from the fruit, oatmeal, peanut butter and protein powder helped slow the absorption of natural sugars into my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Mart√≠nez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I learned: Even natural fruit juices can cause glucose spikes, especially when consumed on an empty stomach and without any protein or fiber. Smoothies that include protein, fat and fiber can help keep spikes at bay and help stabilize your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance your meals with protein, fats and fiber¬†&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Mart√≠nez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that week, I had sushi rolls with a side of edamame for dinner. To my surprise, my glucose levels stayed within range the whole time. Oura Advisor (Oura's AI coach) even pointed out that this food combination offered protein and fiber, which likely contributed to the steady glucose levels. This moment was really encouraging for me. It made me realize that I don't need to drastically change what I eat. By just being more intentional about how I pair my foods, I can drastically improve the impact they have on my blood glucose. Pairing your foods with healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil can also slow digestion and therefore the absorption of sugars.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton explains that this is primarily due to what happens in our digestive tract, even before the nutrients get to our bloodstream. Protein, fiber and healthy fats work in their own way to slow the absorption of simple carbohydrates into the bloodstream, making a slower, more gradual release of sugars into the blood. These factors turn what could be a glucose spike into a steady rise that your body can clear gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest area of concern when managing our blood sugar levels is limiting refined carbohydrates. When you do choose a refined-carb item (a plain cracker, white flour tortilla, cookies, etc.), try to pair it instead of eating it solo: add cheese, nut butter or a handful of edamame to blunt the glucose rise, and choose a higher-fiber version of your carbohydrate source when possible (for example, whole-grain crackers) so the carbs come packaged with their own speed limit," Fitton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cake and a walk equal steady blood sugar?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising things I learned was that blood sugar stability isn't just about what you eat. It's also about what you do after you eat. One afternoon, I had a slice of cake for a snack. No fiber or protein added, just the cake (I had lunch a few hours before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of my blood sugar spiking, my glucose levels remained steadily in range. The caveat? I took a brisk walk after having my dessert. It wasn't anything strenuous, just a short 15-minute walk around my neighborhood. But it was enough to help my body process and use the glucose more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body knows that exercise demands more energy, and so it helps open up our cells to soak up sugar (energy) and remove it from our blood. A 10-minute walk burns about 30 to 40 calories, and your body will get that energy from circulating glucose or stored glycogen," Fitton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating cake and going for a walk, my blood sugar saw a slight spike, but stayed within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Mart√≠nez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/walking-after-eating" target="_self"&gt;walk after meals&lt;/a&gt; has long been recommended by experts for metabolic health, but seeing the effect in real time made it click for me. I do think that having the cake after having a balanced meal with protein and fiber also contributed to my steady levels of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it's not about completely eliminating our favorite treats or carbs, but more so about timing, food pairing and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways I learned to flatten my glucose curve without sacrificing my favorite meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using the glucose sensor with Oura, I assumed blood sugar spikes were mostly about foods and how they impact your body. I also thought the only way to manage them was to cut carbs or drastically change my diet. But over these two weeks, I experienced firsthand how and when I eat (and move) matter just as much as what I eat. I learned that these three strategies helped keep my glucose levels in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pair carbs and sweets with protein, fiber and healthy fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had a berry smoothie with protein powder and soy milk, my glucose levels stayed steady. In contrast, when I had a fruit smoothie earlier that week, my blood sugar levels spiked and crashed more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Carbs on their own, especially refined and processed carbs, can spike blood sugar quickly, but adding protein or fat slows digestion and leads to a more gentle spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food pairing examples: &lt;/strong&gt;Apples and peanut butter, toast with avocado, rice with beans or another protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniela Duncan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walk it out (especially after sweets)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had cake as a snack, I was sure my graph would spike dramatically, but it didn't because of my walk (and eating a balanced meal before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple walk, even just 10 to 15 minutes, can help offset blood sugar spikes. This small but simple habit helps me now enjoy treats without the crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timing your food matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that when I ate higher-carb foods earlier in the day, my body processed them better than when I had them later at night. Breakfast smoothies and bowls kept my levels stable, while the same smoothie after 9 p.m. caused more spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to blood sugar management, we see that in the morning our body usually has a spike in cortisol (a stress hormone) that can actually help our body take up sugar very quickly and quickly manage blood sugar. Eating in the morning will also calm the cortisol response, reducing the stress on your body. If you wait too long to eat, excess cortisol can create inflammation and also produce larger glucose spikes when you do eat," explained Fitton.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that, conversely, in the evening, the sugar management systems in our bodies start powering down and are not as good at helping blood sugar get into the cells. So it is important to try not to eat too late; otherwise, you'll probably see blood sugar go up and stay up for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you can't eat carbs or treats at night, but eating them earlier in the day when insulin sensitivity tends to be higher can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 21:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBYVGJ6WlBIZ2FYLUJuQmc5OVhHVVBnalVabnVsc1JhLWp1d3NpWjRvVzRZSUpfM1lBMk1INmk2VmZtSEtCZkFYWFkxM1F3ekJDMnVNVjJhTlZObzNJeFNnS29JOEJPRWI0WjJ2QVpmUVIzZnI2S0E</guid></item><item><title>ÁßëÂ≠¶ÂÆ∂Â∑≤ÁªèÁ°ÆÂàáÂú∞ËÆ°ÁÆóÂá∫È•ÆÈÖí‰ºöÂáèÂ∞ëÂ§öÂ∞ëÊó∂Èó¥- AOL.com | Scientists Have Figured Out Exactly How Much Time Drinking Takes Off Your Life - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE52M0dYeFROUnRmYWVQYUd6cXpaekphZjB2bjhyY1BjNE8zU2g3Ml9tUXNyaGdZMkVYRXNXbVhWS2ZUT1hFWnhuRnB3Qy1HOTRIMzRoUC1FaGUzTmFNS1Z2d2dlMVlfdFAteUlkUTFCVXUxcUhUSUcxMEJ0Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Can Drinking Alcohol Shorten Your Life?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Kesu01 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, there's been a lot of talk about the &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a63384822/is-it-healthy-to-drink-alcohol-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:negative effects of drinking alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;negative effects of drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. In December of last year, the U.S. Surgeon General released an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advisory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; warning about the direct relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer. Around the same time, new research challenged long-held beliefs about the safety of moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.23-00283" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Tim Stockwell and colleagues found that even low levels of alcohol consumption are linked to increased mortality. Dr. Stockwell later estimated, in media interviews, how this risk might translate into days or years of life lost depending on drinking level. He told the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13605039/Exact-number-alcohol-shortens-life-expectancy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that consuming just two drinks per week may shorten your life by three to six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, for frequent imbibers, the numbers get even bleaker. According to Dr. Stockwell‚Äôs comments to the media, if a person were to drink seven alcoholic beverages a week (beer, wine, or spirits), they risk cutting their life expectancy by two and a half months. A person who drinks 35 alcoholic beverages a week could shorten their life by two years, based on his interpretation of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stockwell told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that these numbers are averages, and some people could end up luckier than others. He discouraged people from considering alcohol as something that is okay or even healthy to consume in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; defines moderate drinking as one drink or less per day for women and two or less for men. For years, moderate drinking was considered okay, if not beneficial. However, Dr. Stockwell's research‚Äîand a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; he co-authored, which analyzed 107 studies from over 40 years‚Äîdisputed that belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Stockwell‚Äôs review of years of research really challenges the old idea that a little alcohol is good for you. What he and his team found is that even small amounts of alcohol can shorten your lifespan," &lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Raj Dasgupta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Medical Advisor for Sleepopolis tells &lt;em&gt;Delish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dasgupta explains that both how much you drink and how often you drink impacts life expectancy.

It‚Äôs even harder when there‚Äôs this amount of debris,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUntil this is remediated it‚Äôs going to be a real struggle.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concorde Condominiums residents filed their first complaint of bedbugs to the Brookline Public Health Department on April 30, Reiss said. The department investigated the unit on May 7, and it was later inspected by Dewey Pest and Wildlife, a pest control service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúConditions are best described as deplorable,‚Äù wrote an entomologist from the pest control service in an assessment of the unit. ‚ÄúMost inspectible surfaces and items in the unit have been heavily contaminated by bedbugs and their feces.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entomologist also recommended that a disaster remediation service should be hired to clean and decontaminate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condo was deemed ‚Äúunfit for human habitation‚Äù on May 12, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 14, the health department ordered the resident to vacate the unit, Reiss said. After that, the process transferred out of the health department‚Äôs hands and into the court‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the remediation process has moved at a much slower pace than residents would like ‚Äî¬†and now, more than a month later, the problem remains unresolved, residents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe were hoping the health department would clean it out ‚Ä¶ or help us out by enforcing their order of condemnation, which they have not done,‚Äù said the resident who had an infected bedbug bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really up to the condo association and their legal process to get the order enforced,‚Äù Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://brookline.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Order-on-PI-6.4.25.pdf"&gt;court order&lt;/a&gt; filed on June 4 required the resident with the severe bedbugs case to ‚Äúclean and restore‚Äù the condo to liveable conditions and to hire an extermination service for the bedbugs by June 11. The resident did not abide by the court order by June 11, so the Condominium Trust may legally enter the condominium and take steps to clean and restore it, according to the court order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Plaintiffs intend to proceed in accordance with the terms of the Court‚Äôs Order, and to avail themselves to the rights and relief afforded thereunder, as may be necessary and appropriate, and to the extent authorized,‚Äù wrote Jennifer Barnett, an attorney representing the Concorde Condominiums Trustees, in a statement to Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town‚Äôs attorneys are also in ‚Äúclose communications‚Äù with another attorney representing the Concorde Condominiums Trustees, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Brookline.News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:22:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOTUhqZDhyakhmRjA5V0FacTBoMFAxUlJzNkx5djFCQzBVNnFSTlNJWVdDcjF4M05vemwxdUxHZlF4ZkhyZEgwYW1UU1MzRW9MbElNb2FNUllsTmRaQ1J3eVZkLVU0dGdEWkdxbm40d2F6eXpoTERFZC1qSEJqcVR5dDhoV0JaVk56UHVPMFhsd0YyTUZMMi13ZVE0d0o</guid></item><item><title>Áù°Áú†ÁöÑÁßòÂØÜÂ∫èÂàóÂèØËÉΩ‰ºöÂÉèËä±Âõ≠‰∏ÄÊ†∑Â°ëÈÄ†Êàë‰ª¨ÁöÑËÆ∞ÂøÜ-Á•ûÁªèÁßëÂ≠¶Êñ∞Èóª | Sleep‚Äôs Secret Sequence May Sculpt Our Memories Like a Garden - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE5vTHkwTkluUjVHcGRrb2h6RXBZbkFPSTUydm8tNklIaS1aMzlXMnlSdkV4S1JCVzZiX3VkYUx3NFYyb3lSckFTOXBkSlpoYWpTN0tLYlowdWtfeXdrV3Z1MWpKYXpkQnVnQlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new theory suggests that the order of sleep phases‚Äînon-REM followed by REM‚Äîis essential for strengthening and organizing memories. In mouse studies and computational models, researchers found that non-REM sleep reinforces new memories, while REM sleep prunes overlapping or irrelevant ones, keeping them distinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversing this cycle causes memory degradation, highlighting why the natural progression of sleep stages is so evolutionarily conserved. While more research is needed, the findings offer a compelling explanation for how sleep architecture supports learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gardening:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-REM sleep grows and stabilizes memories; REM trims overlapping ones to keep them distinct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Reversing the non-REM to REM sequence causes loss of memory rather than refinement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model-Driven Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining mouse data with circuit-based simulations revealed how acetylcholine dynamics shape memory during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although we know sleep is essential to our physical and mental well-being, it remains an incredibly enigmatic behavior, scientifically speaking.¬†&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan, however, may have developed a new theory to account for one of sleep‚Äôs looming mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every living thing that sleeps appears to follow the same basic pattern. From wakefulness, organisms transition to a repeating cycle of sleep with low brain activity followed by a stage where our brains are harder at work, among other things, generating vivid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111099"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain as a tree." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;But researchers can‚Äôt yet zero in on all the individual neurons encoding specific memories with available techniques, so this is where the team‚Äôs modeling stepped in to help complete the picture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans‚Äô eyes also dance around behind our eyelids during that high-activity stage, which is why it‚Äôs referred to as rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are a few notable exceptions‚Äîincluding people with narcolepsy and people who haven‚Äôt slept in days‚Äîthis repeating non-REM to REM sleep cycle is remarkably prevalent across the animal kingdom.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEvolutionarily, it‚Äôs so preserved and so ubiquitous across species,‚Äù said¬†Sara Aton, U-M professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThat means there‚Äôs probably something really important about that particular order of sleep. And it never goes in reverse, unless something has really screwed up the system.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, scientists have lacked a satisfying explanation for the biological function of this virtually universal phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, U-M researchers led by Aton and¬†Michal Zochowski¬†have put together a theory built on experimental observations in mice and computer modeling of the brain‚Äôs neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That theory posits that, if memories were shrubs, the non-REM phase of sleep helps them grow taller and stronger. The REM stage then prunes, keeping them shapely and distinct, and preventing them from overlapping and growing into each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt only works if you have this sequence. If you go in reverse and have REM first, it prunes everything away. Then no memory is left,‚Äù Aton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn the proper sequence, you reinforce things that need to be reinforced. Then REM comes in to prune back the overlapping portions of unrelated memories.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, the researchers could observe the effect of sleep on remembering simple conditioning experiments. In humans, Zochowski said, this could have familiar implications in our everyday business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say you have three meetings in a day. We know that you‚Äôll remember these meetings better after a good night‚Äôs sleep,‚Äù Zochowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúNow, it appears that during non-REM sleep, you‚Äôre strengthening your memory of each meeting. But you also need to remember who said what and during which meeting. What REM does is keep that separate.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is published in the journal¬†&lt;em&gt;PLoS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;¬†and was supported by the National Science Foundation, a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was made possible, in part, by advances made by the broader community over the last dozen years, fostered by the NIH‚Äôs Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN, Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycles and circuits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Aton‚Äôs team, the researchers‚Äô latest experiments monitored mice brains to see which parts of the hippocampus were active during different phases of sleep following a simple conditioning scenario.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were moved from their home enclosures to a new environment and, after exploring a couple minutes, would receive a small shock to their feet. There was also a control group of mice who experienced no such unpleasantries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This enabled the researchers to compare brain activity of sleeping mice during REM and non-REM cycles that had and hadn‚Äôt forged an association between the new space and a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers can‚Äôt yet zero in on all the individual neurons encoding specific memories with available techniques, so this is where the team‚Äôs modeling stepped in to help complete the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model was developed by Zochowski‚Äôs group and treats newly encoded memories as changes in the activity of neurons in circuits, subject to the brain‚Äôs environment where a biochemical called acetylcholine modulates their activity.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe can actually simulate and pinpoint which neurons are being activated by a learning event,‚Äù Aton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe can model that and we can model changes that happen with respect to acetylcholine as an animal goes through the different stages of sleep.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also two types of neurons: excitatory ones that tend to stimulate their neighbors and inhibitory ones that tamp down the activity of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining these dynamics with real world data on brain activity and acetylcholine levels during different phases of sleep, the model helped reveal conclusions that were previously inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers are excited by the result, they stressed that this is not the final word on the matter. Their circuit model is a simplified representation of the brain and the team‚Äôs experiments tested relatively straightforward memory scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the theory could change or evolve as researchers subject it to more complex test cases and provide it with new and different types of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat we have now is a study that says, ‚ÄòLook, this is what could be happening,'‚Äù Zochowski said. ‚ÄúNow we have to prove that the model is associated with reality.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#620f031616120d101622170f0b010a4c070617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Davenport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umich.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Davenport ‚Äì University of Michigan&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;‚Äú&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cholinergic modulation of neural networks supports sequential and complementary roles for NREM and REM states in memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù by Sara Aton et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cholinergic modulation of neural networks supports sequential and complementary roles for NREM and REM states in memory consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across vertebrate species, sleep consists of repeating cycles of NREM followed by REM. However, their respective functions, and their stereotypic cycling pattern are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a simplified biophysical network model, we investigate the potential role of cholinergic modulation, acting via the muscarinic receptors, on network dynamics and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that low and high cholinergic levels associated with NREM and REM sleep, respectively, may play critical, sequential roles in memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network dynamics that facilitate these roles arise through alteration of neural excitability and changes to network-wide excitatory/inhibitory balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At low acetylcholine (ACh) levels, reduced activation of inhibitory neurons leads to network-wide disinhibition and bursts of synchronized activity led by engram neurons, driving recruitment of additional excitatory neurons into the engram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, at high ACh levels, increased network inhibition suppresses firing in all but the most strongly recruited excitatory neurons, pruning the expanded engram population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these results provide a testable hypothesis regarding the role of sleep state-specific cholinergic modulation in the process of memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:22:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5vTHkwTkluUjVHcGRrb2h6RXBZbkFPSTUydm8tNklIaS1aMzlXMnlSdkV4S1JCVzZiX3VkYUx3NFYyb3lSckFTOXBkSlpoYWpTN0tLYlowdWtfeXdrV3Z1MWpKYXpkQnVnQlE</guid></item><item><title>GLP-1ËçØÁâ©Â∏ÆÂä©1ÂûãÁ≥ñÂ∞øÁóÖÊÇ£ËÄÖ‰øùÊåÅÂÅ•Â∫∑ÁöÑË°ÄÁ≥ñÊ∞¥Âπ≥ÂíåÂáèËÇ•- STAT | GLP-1 drug helped type 1 diabetes patients keep healthy glucose levels and lose weight - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQSmlWb1BpYkp2dEVNMlZHRGVPQUZHZEVLbmdhVDdtVkZ5RHJER2FuNzdLRms3SlE1T3FMX3Zsdm5Ma0F1UzllblB6cm1WS0s4aHNBWklCNE9PVWkxN3FuZ1ZfZ190Y3llQXcyQjVoQ0dNRVdnV2Z2TUlodE5vVXB4V2NzRTBsWEE4NXhIQ2lrWTh5UTctU2xrX2JHay12MmFjR2JFNE9YTmxjeV9ZVEpocmpxUHk5UVBYeHliRkZ6dVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="elizabeth-cooney"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;Elizabeth Cooney is a cardiovascular disease reporter at STAT, covering heart, stroke, and metabolic conditions.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity drugs were first approved to treat type 2 diabetes, but there‚Äôs a growing movement to test them in type 1 diabetes, too. Research presented Monday at a large diabetes meeting showed some promise for this approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients who took a GLP-1 drug fared better than those in a control group at keeping their blood glucose levels in a healthy range while also losing more weight than those who weren‚Äôt taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded, randomized control trial enrolled 72 adults with a BMI of 30 or higher who use automated insulin delivery systems to manage their type 1 diabetes. Split into two groups, half received weekly 1-milligram injections of semaglutide ‚Äî the preferred GLP-1 drug and dose when the study was designed five years ago ‚Äî and half received a placebo.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

Yet beneath the mop of filaments sits an anglerfish that can inhale prey faster than most cameras can blink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine ecologist Dr. Maarten De Brauwer of &lt;a href="https://research.csiro.au/environomics/our-people/early-career-researchers-separate-bios/dr-maarten-brauwer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Curtin University&lt;/a&gt; first noticed that the fish‚Äôs lure shines neon orange under blue light, while the rest of the body stays dull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team‚Äôs 2016 field &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-016-1493-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; on Philippine reefs linked that glow to free‚Äëswimming worms that share the same color and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hairy-frogfish-hides-by-copying-reef-textures"&gt;Hairy frogfish hides by copying reef textures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hairy frogfish belongs to the anglerfish &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/frogfish-lure-their-prey-with-a-built-in-fishing-rod-and-bait/"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of lurking in the deep it prowls coral rubble in tropical shallows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coat of branching spinules lets it copy the texture of algae, sponge, or coral until the head seems to vanish into the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals can swap pattern and shade within weeks, shifting from lemon yellow to mottled black as sediment, light, and growth change around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rapid makeover is a textbook example of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519323002801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Batesian mimicry&lt;/a&gt;, a tactic where harmless looks discourage predators while inviting unsuspecting prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sight alone does not give the trick away, because even the fish‚Äôs eyes carry radiating stripes that obscure the pupil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the stubby ‚Äúarm‚Äù formed by the first dorsal spine, called the &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/illicium-zoology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;illicium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, rises above the camouflage like a tiny fishing pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-glowing-lure-helps-the-hairy-frogfish"&gt;How the glowing lure helps the hairy frogfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThese observations indicate a novel function, prey capture, for biofluorescence in coral reef fishes,‚Äù wrote De Brauwer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under daylight the &lt;em&gt;illicium&lt;/em&gt; ends in a dull worm‚Äëshaped tassel, but blue‚Äëfiltered lamps reveal intense &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59528-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biofluorescence&lt;/a&gt; that converts blue light to orange.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea fits a wider pattern, because a survey of 180 fish species found &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glowing pigments&lt;/a&gt; clustered in cryptic reef lineages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; ichthyologist &lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/staff-directory/john-s-sparks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. John Sparks&lt;/a&gt; noted that ‚Äúbiofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coral‚Äëreef lineages,‚Äù hinting at communication or hunting value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By matching the fluorescent worms that drift over sandy bottoms at night, the lure likely acts as a living decoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sea-anglerfish-defy-evolutionary-expectations/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; twitches the tip in arcs and pulses that copy the jellied plankton‚Äôs swim, drawing curious gobies and cardinalfish within lunging range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fastest-strikes-on-record"&gt;Fastest strikes on record&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a victim lines up, the mouth opens twelve times wider than its resting size, pulling in water and prey through rapid &lt;a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/striated-frogfish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suction feeding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High‚Äëspeed videos have timed the attack at just six milliseconds, making the frogfish one of the quickest predators recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That burst happens because elastic ligaments around the jaw store energy while the fish crouches. Releasing the latch snaps the head forward, creating a pressure wave that drags prey inward before the target knows it moved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stomach then stretches like a balloon, letting a four‚Äëinch frogfish swallow a meal almost twice its own length. Mouth, stomach, and even gill covers reset within minutes, ready for the next ambush without swimming far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hairy-frogfish-lives-without-swimming"&gt;Hairy frogfish lives without swimming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frogfish seldom swim, preferring a slow shuffle powered by limb‚Äëlike pectoral and pelvic fins. The gait looks clumsy, yet it lets the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/world-frog-day-2025-protecting-natures-tiny-guardians/"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; creep through branching corals or over sponges without stirring mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fishbase.se/summary/Antennarius-striatus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FishBase&lt;/a&gt; records show the species from New‚ÄØJersey to Brazil and across the Indo‚ÄëPacific, at depths ranging from tide pools to 720‚ÄØfeet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most adults settle below 100‚ÄØfeet where wave surge is gentle, but juveniles often lurk among shore grass beds that teem with shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males change color during courtship, trailing females to the surface where a buoyant ribbon of up to 288,000 eggs drifts free. Larvae hatch in open water and later drop to the bottom, beginning the camouflage dance anew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-findings-mean"&gt;What the findings mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAggressive mimicry allows a predator to masquerade as something harmless to approach prey,‚Äù wrote marine zoologist &lt;a href="https://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/44.3/299.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;John E. Randall&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressive mimicry, where a predator disguises itself as the prey‚Äôs food, shows up in a handful of reef hunters.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluorescent lure adds a light signal to that illusion, effective only for animals with visual pigments tuned to blue and green. Future lab tests will measure how often fish reject non‚Äëfluorescent lures compared with glowing ones, refining ideas about sensory ecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these cues may also improve non‚Äëinvasive survey methods that use fluorescence to spot cryptic species on night dives. Conservation teams already trial blue‚Äëlight transects to count seahorses and pipefish that vanish under white lamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-protect-hairy-frogfish"&gt;How to protect hairy frogfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antennarius striatus&lt;/em&gt; sits on the &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/16406979/115354869#assessment-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IUCN list&lt;/a&gt; as ‚ÄúLeast Concern,‚Äù but habitat loss threatens local populations on polluted coasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors sometimes trawl adults for the aquarium trade, yet demand remains modest compared with bright reef staples like clownfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting rubble fields and sea‚Äëgrass beds will likely benefit the frogfish alongside countless small invertebrates. Marine parks can also restrict night fishing with lights that might interfere with fluorescent signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizen scientists armed with blue torches contribute valuable sightings through photo databases. Each image builds a map of occurrence, molt timing, and lure color that researchers can mine for long‚Äëterm trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-016-1493-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coral Reefs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äî‚Äì&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:46:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPeFV6TWFtOTQtQlpYcDl1NTBSekctaXRDNHJtVE5jcW1pWElBSHVrVWJHTXlxTl9MUFVUSlFvZFZRSDFTSnM1RXpSTzZ2dFJGM1hxYkxvNnd2cC1hZnJLZ3hhS2lhXzZQOVMyMERJcUd0TnJrMEdIb1ZWX2dqdUZ6Zmw3MHptQVV4QWFGS0xoN3UxSlNmRnhTekVvSUhEYlMxanY3ek15ZlNkZW8</guid></item><item><title>ÁßëÂ≠¶ÂÆ∂Âú®Êó•Â∏∏Ê¥ªÂä®‰∏≠ÂèñÂæó‰∫ÜÂ∑®Â§ßÁöÑÁó¥ÂëÜÁóáÁ™ÅÁ†¥ÔºåËøôÂèØËÉΩ‰ºöÂáèÁºìÁîöËá≥È¢ÑÈò≤ÁñæÁóÖ-ÊØèÊó•ÈÇÆÊä• | Scientists make huge dementia breakthrough with everyday activity that may slow or even prevent disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNMm92d3lwOFUzUS1VUS13RlR5Y2dfdnFpbWpJMmsydVZzdlJ3NzMzZDlyYkxRYXNmdER0V1JTeFktbFZOMjFBRlpKT1k5N2drb0lRQzlnWkVPZjFmU2NDeVFKSlB3M0ZVVUJwX3g1SXNzakRlS1d4UzZwOUsxWElJR194aTJWN2t2UE04cEx2bzFjNzV6LVBVdzJDQi1XSURibC1YZDBEdFBERThWRE5KUkdTLXN2ejdHMjBmTjJHcmN4WlFncnplWVM1UWpIRC1YbTZ3Nw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Listening to the radio or playing your favorite songs while you cook may bolster your memory and reduce your risk of dementia later in life, new research reveals.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team of scientists from Rice University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-dd72edd0-505e-11f0-be41-87375c09d163"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-dd71b550-505e-11f0-be41-87375c09d163"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-dd722a80-505e-11f0-be41-87375c09d163"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, tested college students' memories by having them complete tasks while they weren't listening to music and then again when they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9593987/University-Pittsburgh-study-finds-making-music-help-dementia-cognitive-issues.html"&gt;stronger emotional response&lt;/a&gt; to the music they heard showed a better ability to remember the images of everyday activities they were quizzed on.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team built upon years of research that examined the power of music for memory, but added that the mechanism for remembering is how emotional people become while listening to the music.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings could have a wide-reaching impact, offering hope for the 8.6 million Americans with dementia, more than 7 million of whom have Alzheimer‚Äôs.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist, told the Daily Mail music can be part of an effective tool in reducing the risk and possibly slowing the progression of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Music helps tap into memories and emotions that might otherwise feel out of reach,' she said. 'Over time, that kind of stimulation might delay how quickly symptoms progress.'¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe that a 'moderate' emotional response bolsters the connection between parts of the brain, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2521856/Listening-pop-music-help-people-severe-brain-injuries-recall-memories.html"&gt;improving people's memories&lt;/a&gt;.

That‚Äôs why emotionally charged music can boost recall of big-picture experiences.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers played music gathered for the study by searching emotional keywords like ‚Äòsad,‚Äô ‚Äòhappy‚Äô and ‚Äòcalming‚Äô on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They chose three songs per category, designed to trigger emotions after having a separate group rate them for pleasantness, familiarity and mood.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants then completed a memory task sorting 128 everyday objects as ‚Äòindoor‚Äô or ‚Äòoutdoor‚Äô - a subtle way to test recall.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a 30-minute break, participants repeated the memory task with 192 images - some old, some new - to measure both general and detailed recall.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, they listened to music, neutral sounds (like crackling fire) or silence for 10 minutes while filling out mood and wellness questionnaires, followed by 20 minutes of quiet.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;While the total number of people diagnosed is relatively small, the diagnosis rate of early-onset dementia and Alzheimer's disease is increasing, especially in younger age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they completed the memory task again, sorting images as old or new.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Music successfully prompted an emotional response at differing levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers sorted participants into minor, moderate or significant emotional responses after the listening session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a moderate emotional response to the music performed better on the last memory test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, people with either very low or very high emotional responses had poorer memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more emotionally activated someone is, the more the brain flags that moment as worth storing,'¬†Dr Idoko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That‚Äôs why emotionally charged music can boost recall of big-picture experiences. And why, when an emotional response is more moderate, the brain has more bandwidth to encode the details.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study compared memory in college students, its findings could benefit Americans over 65 who are more likely to experience dementia.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Projected yearly incidence of dementia on the basis of current rates (solid lines) and projected incidence of dementia assuming continuation of a decreasing trend (dashed lines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Every state except one has seen a surge in Alzheimer's fatalities between 1999 and 2021, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older adults who have not been diagnosed with dementia might still begin to exhibit signs of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 12.2 million Americans are living with mild cognitive impairment - a possible stepping stone to Alzheimer‚Äôs that involves memory lapses and mental slowdowns noticeable to the person and those around them, but not severe enough to disrupt daily routines.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain is particularly adept at storing memories of events or phases of one‚Äôs life where music played a prominent role, improving their ability to recall memories of those events when that music plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn‚Äôt have to be music they know. Past research has shown that patients can recall personal memories in greater detail even when they listen to unfamiliar music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yelena Sokolsky, a home health nurse and founder of Galaxy Homecare, told the Daily Mail that music therapy is especially valuable for people with early dementia.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As cognitive functioning declines, individuals may struggle with verbal communication - this can lead to feelings of heightened confusion, fear or agitation.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, music can evoke emotion and memories, bringing comfort even when other forms of communication become challenging.'¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This additional fluid loss, combined with fluid loss from nausea, vomiting and reduced intake, can lead to severe dehydration and heat related illness if not properly managed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 1,200 Americans die from heat-related causes every year, though officials note the actual number could be 10-fold higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, about one in eight Americans - around 40million - has reported taking a GLP-1 agonist at some point.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 agonists mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is released after eating, to slow digestion and increase feelings of fullness. In turn, this leads to eating - and drinking - less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sandip Sachar, a dentist at Sachar Dental in New York City, said while 'this effect is more pronounced with food emptying, it can also slow the emptying of liquids.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 receptors are found in the lamina terminalis, a region of the brain that senses thirst and regulates water balance.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss drugs may bind to those areas to decrease feelings of thirst, though research on this mechanism is still early.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sachar said: 'Slowing of GI emptying may reduce hunger and also may prevent thirst. Patients have told me that when they feel full, it is more difficult to drink a lot of water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking Ozempic or similar drugs for obesity are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney disease, all of which raise the risk of dehydration, Dr Reierson said.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These conditions may reduce thirst and lead to retention and other fluid imbalances.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian and founder of the Better Nutrition Program, also told DailyMail.com: 'When you are taking a medication that slows gastric emptying, dehydration is a concern because the stomach acid and digestive juices, as well as overall metabolism and digestion and elimination, require optimal hydration.'¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kavin Mistry, a neuroradiologist and longevity expert, also pointed to common GLP-1 side effects like nausea and vomiting as a cause of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When fluid is not being replaced efficiently, the risk of dehydration increases, particularly in warmer weather when water needs are already higher,' he said.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, eating less food overall also decreases fluid intake.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Reierson told this website: 'We often forget that food contributes to our daily water intake and eating less can lead to lower hydration.'¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Summertime favorites like watermelon, cucumbers and tomatoes are more than 90 percent water and can help boost fluid intake.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sachar also recommends chewing sugar-free gum to increase saliva production, which can stave off dehydration, and steer clear of acidic foods and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr Reierson added: 'I don‚Äôt recommend that patients at higher risk for dehydration stop or not take a GLP-1 medication, however, it is important to exercise extra caution and work with your healthcare provider to ensure a comprehensive plan and strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mistry recommends people on weight-loss drugs set reminders to drink water regularly, even if you're not thirsty, and steer clear of drinks like caffeine and alcohol, which are dehydrating.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For healthy adults, the risk of illness after being licked by a pet that receives regular veterinary care is negligible. But when dogs and cats lick people with weak immune systems, serious infections can follow. Here‚Äôs what to know about why pets do this, and when you should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QUY7FTIC4JD2PEXXZKKWB7CVMU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QUY7FTIC4JD2PEXXZKKWB7CVMU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why do dogs and cats lick people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZDDHADUUFG2NDT677G6MOGI4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/pet-ownership-statistics/"&gt;More than 60 percent of U.S. households&lt;/a&gt; include a pet, for good reason: pet ownership reduces loneliness, depression and anxiety. Rustin Moore, dean of the veterinary school at Ohio State University and &lt;a href="https://www.rustinmooredvm.com/about"&gt;author of an upcoming book&lt;/a&gt; on the human-animal bond, says this bond ‚Äúhas a profound power to heal, comfort and connect us; it is one of the most underutilized tools for improving human well-being.‚Äù Animal-assisted therapy is increasingly used in schools, nursing homes, hospices, prisons and hospitals, with benefits that include reduced pain perception, more rapid recovery from surgery, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106503/"&gt;improved emotional skills&lt;/a&gt; in children with disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6A4TOJAJOZHJNLRQGXVRY3AEZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Licking is a common behavior in pets. In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7345801/"&gt;2020 study from Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, hand-licking by dogs was reported by 86 percent of owners ‚Äî and face-licking by 50 percent of owners. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18390853/"&gt;a study in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, more than 50 percent of people said their dogs licked visitors, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGDY7YA3WBCSFP3Q5C2MU3PGJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Animals lick other animals for many reasons. New moms lick their babies to clean and protect them (saliva has certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003193849090332X?via%3Dihub"&gt;antibacterial properties,&lt;/a&gt; which also could explain why animals lick their wounds). Animals also lick one another during ‚Äúsocial grooming,‚Äù a bonding behavior that is particularly common in cats. A dog may lick humans to show &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22644113/"&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt;. And ‚Äî given the opportunity ‚Äî pets will meticulously lick skin that has traces of food or salty sweat on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJURIOWXZJBQFGW4B3DDYWWR4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it‚Äôs reinforced by positive social interactions (such as petting and a soothing voice), licking also can be a way to get attention. Genetics, other environmental influences, and age also influence licking behavior ‚Äî in the U.K. study, younger dogs were more likely to lick people than older dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OK32PJYIUZH3HJOBZVFI2FJLNE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OK32PJYIUZH3HJOBZVFI2FJLNE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Are there germs in my pet‚Äôs saliva?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q24DCCUYCBEV7EZ7D4PTCKHE2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In short, yes. Despite saliva‚Äôs antibacterial effects, a pet‚Äôs mouth harbors billions of bacteria just waiting to infect humans when introduced into open wounds. Within this ‚Äúbacterial soup‚Äù are two organisms with tongue-twisting names and a special ability to cause severe human disease: &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga canimorsus&lt;/i&gt; (capno-sigh-toh-fah-gah canny-morse-us), a long, rod-shaped bug; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella multocida &lt;/i&gt;(par-stew-rella mul-tee-sigh-dar), a tiny oval-shaped bug. Although I wish these organisms had nicknames, they don‚Äôt ‚Äî so I‚Äôll just call them &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;here (recognizing that there are other &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; species that are not important causes of human disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DBPD2XHQHFDPRN3GXI4CTMIFU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you own a dog or cat, you probably live with these germs ‚Äî they‚Äôre found in most healthy dogs and cats. &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; inhabits the mouth of more than 70 percent of dogs and 55 percent of cats, whereas &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;is found in more than 50 percent of dogs and more than 70 percent of cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FMG6C27YBBHRZNPFMIOEHEQILQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FMG6C27YBBHRZNPFMIOEHEQILQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why do doctors worry about these two bugs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A2O4XOPFOZFURFGC3BVQ6VSP34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although rare, &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;infections are concerning, because they progress rapidly, and up to one-third of infections can be fatal. Within just a few days of a lick or bite, &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; can multiply in your blood and cause critical organs to fail. These infections are also hard to diagnose, because &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; grows slowly in the laboratory. The most severe form of infection ‚Äî a gruesome gangrenous skin condition known as purpura fulminans ‚Äî has a mortality rate of 60 percent. Survivors often face amputation of fingers, toes or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EKDWCRLAMNBV3MP423GWUVRU3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; infections are more common, because &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;is frequently involved in bite wound infections (think of it as the common cat bite bug). Much less often, serious &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections follow licking, especially in babies or people that allow pets to lick open wounds or medical devices. With increasing animal ownership and advancements in human medical therapy, reports of &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27544345/"&gt;knee and hip replacements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32192435/"&gt;peritoneal dialysis&lt;/a&gt; systems and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21687004/"&gt;long-term vascular access devices&lt;/a&gt; are increasing. ‚ÄúWe have seen serious &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections that arose after cats ‚Äî especially kittens ‚Äî chewed on and contaminated dialysis equipment,‚Äù says Natascha Tuznik, an infectious-disease physician at the University of California-Davis. ‚ÄúSuch equipment should always be kept away from pets.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="66UV6RRQBNGAJIFRIWIBYLKUD4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="66UV6RRQBNGAJIFRIWIBYLKUD4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How often does licking lead to serious infections?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGPVMPRWCNHFRHFZ2NXORKNNHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While bacteria like &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;are very common in your pet‚Äôs saliva, it‚Äôs incredibly rare for people to get sick after being licked. Every year, millions of bloodstream infections occur in North America and Europe, but fewer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;than 600 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;infections and just 20 cases of purpura fulminans&lt;/a&gt; have ever been reported. Infections from licking are most likely to occur in infants, pregnant people, people over 50, or people with conditions such as AIDS, cancer, alcoholism, diabetes or organ transplants. Tuznik notes that ‚Äúpeople who lack a functioning spleen are particularly susceptible to &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; infections and are specifically advised to avoid being licked by pets.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XACGUYAW2VCT7PNGU6G2ERM4OE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XACGUYAW2VCT7PNGU6G2ERM4OE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How can I reduce the chance of infection from licking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EE4LK3UWJERLC5IWIHBDMZIOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wash your skin with soap and water after being licked.

And people in high-risk groups should limit contact to snuggles instead of smooches.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from a group of scientists led by Queen Mary University of London, published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/increased-risk-of-provisional-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd-among-females-with-attentiondeficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-crosssectional-survey-study/CD1DC6B31D4B009AB04F580C1189BC86" target="_blank"&gt;British Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; found that women with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be at higher risk for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;PMDD is characterized by severe emotional (e.g., depressed mood), physical (e.g., fatigue), and cognitive (e.g., difficulties concentrating) symptoms that occur in the days before menstruation. PMDD is a serious mental health condition that is associated with severe outcomes, including an increased risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Thomas Broughton, a postdoctoral researcher, and Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais, a senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, collected online questionnaire responses from over seven hundred women in the UK. The questions asked about individuals' ADHD diagnosis and symptoms, PMDD symptoms, and co-occurring anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared ADHD and non-ADHD groups and found that women with a clinical ADHD diagnosis were over three times more likely to meet criteria for PMDD than those without. Women who had high levels of ADHD symptoms and impairment (even if they did not have a diagnosis from a clinician) were also over four times more likely to have PMDD. The risk for PMDD was highest among women with ADHD who also had a depression or anxiety diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that women with ADHD, and especially those with ADHD and depression/anxiety, may benefit from PMDD screening. This is the case even if they don't have a formal ADHD diagnosis but have high ADHD symptoms and impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais, who supervised the project, said, "Because ADHD was historically considered a condition that mainly affected boys, many issues specific to females have been overlooked, including associations between ADHD and times of hormonal change. Our findings emphasize the need to consider issues affecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult women&lt;/a&gt; with ADHD, and more specifically how females with ADHD may be at higher risk for experiencing PMDD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Broughton added, "Our findings also suggest that further research is needed to improve understanding of the link between ADHD and times of hormonal change, including the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/menstrual+cycle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, and to reduce health inequalities and diagnostic bias in women and girls with ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team includes Dr. Thomas Broughton (Queen Mary University of London), Dr. Ellen Lambert (King's College London), Dr. Jasmin Wertz (University of Edinburgh) and Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais (Queen Mary University of London).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, feeding mice this type of diet before the onset of their disease modestly worsened certain visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ketogenic diets have been proposed to offer anti-inflammatory benefits to people with MS, the findings suggest the type of fat used may be a critical factor when considering such diets as a treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe present new data that the use of [the ketogenic diet] in the treatment of MS should take the composition of the [the ketogenic diet] into consideration,‚Äù the researchers wrote in the study, ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1587760/full"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A high-saturated, long-chain fatty acid ketogenic diet negatively impacts visual and motor-sensory function in a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,‚Äù which was published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by immune-mediated damage to the brain and spinal cord, which gives rise to various &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;neurological manifestations&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first signs of MS is &lt;a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/about-ms/signs-and-symptoms/eyes-and-sight/optic-neuritis"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt;, or inflammation of the optic nerve that carries signals from the eyes to the brain. This can lead to vision problems, including blurred vision, and impaired color vision and depth perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic (keto) diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat regimen originally developed to manage seizure disorders, but that may also have anti-inflammatory effects. The diet forces the body to rely on fat rather than sugar for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest a keto diet may &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/08/02/benefits-ketogenic-diet-rrms-may-be-long-lasting-if-adherence/"&gt;help ease fatigue and improve exercise capacity&lt;/a&gt;, cognition, and hand dexterity in people with MS. However, research in mouse models of MS has yielded mixed results, possibly because some studies used medium-chain fatty acids and others used long-chain fatty acids, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThese studies suggest the need for further analysis of the [keto diets] utilized in [MS] studies and exploration of how the chain length and saturation effects outcomes,‚Äù they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Keto diet‚Äôs effects on MS mouse model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Iowa examined the effects of a keto diet made up of long-chain, saturated fatty acids on optic neuritis using mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an induced disease that‚Äôs often used to model MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-chain, saturated fatty acids are those typically found in red meats (beef, lamb, pork), dairy products (full-fat milk, cream, cheese, butter), and coconut and palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice were fed either the keto or standard diet starting before their disease induction, at the time of induction, or at symptom onset. Along with disease severity, optic neuritis was assessed by measuring visual acuity and electrical impulses along the optic nerve, and by imaging and tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that began the keto diet before EAE induction showed significantly worse disease severity than those on a standard diet. No significant differences were seen when the diet was introduced at disease induction or symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual acuity also declined more severely in mice pretreated with the keto diet, but again, no differences were seen in the groups that started the diet later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe propose that pretreatment with a long-chain, saturated [ketogenic diet] ‚Ä¶ leads to an initial priming of the immune system that results in a more robust immune response and inflammatory cascade when disease induction occurs,‚Äù the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, some aspects of optic nerve health weren‚Äôt affected by diet. Imaging of the retina, a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, showed similar thinning of nerve layers across all EAE groups, regardless of diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the strength and speed of visual signals along the optic nerve were impaired in EAE mice compared with healthy mice, but these impairments didn‚Äôt differ between the diet groups. Tissue analyses also showed similar levels of optic nerve damage in EAE mice across all the diet groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOur results demonstrate that irrespective of the timing of its implementation, a long-chain, saturated fatty acid [ketogenic diet] does not significantly improve visual outcomes in EAE mice,‚Äù wrote the researchers, who noted¬†the findings underscore the importance of considering fat composition, and not just the amount of specific macronutrients, when evaluating the potential use of ketogenic diets in managing MS.&lt;/p&gt;

That‚Äôs not hype. According to a long-term study conducted in Brazil, your ability to perform this simple action without any assistance from your hands, knees, or support may hold clues about your longevity and risk of death from natural causes like heart disease or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test, often referred to as the ‚Äúsit and rise‚Äù test, doesn‚Äôt rely on fancy gym equipment or medical diagnostics. It takes less than 10 seconds, requires no special gear, and yet it may reflect deep insights into your balance, strength, flexibility, and coordination. In fact, researchers found that adults who struggled with this basic movement were significantly more likely to die over the next decade compared to those who completed it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, as reported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, come from a team of researchers at an exercise medicine clinic in Rio de Janeiro, led by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Claudio Gil Araujo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Over 12 years, the team observed over 4,200 adults, uncovering a striking link between this simple movement and long-term survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs explore what they found and why this test might be the wake-up call we didn‚Äôt know we needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your score on this 10-point test may predict your risk of early death&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked 4,282 men and women between the ages of 46 and 75, evaluating their ability to sit down and stand up from the floor without using their hands, knees, or any support. Each participant received a score out of 10, broken into two components - five points for sitting, five for standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 12 years, researchers observed a stark correlation: the lower the score, the higher the risk of death. Participants who scored between 0 and 4 points were six times more likely to die during the follow-up period than those who earned a perfect 10. Those in the middle range (scoring 4.5 to 7.5) faced two to three times the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most eye-opening was this: half of the individuals who scored zero did not survive the 12 years, compared to just 4% of those who scored a full 10. That‚Äôs an 11-fold difference in mortality rates based on one deceptively simple movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A simple test that uncovers strength, balance, and longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, sitting down and standing up seem trivial. But as Dr. Araujo explained to The Washington Post, the movement is surprisingly complex. It draws on several physical abilities at once, notably:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle strength, especially in the legs and core&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility, which declines as we age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance, a major factor in fall prevention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordination and body composition, both tied to cardiovascular and metabolic health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe test works because it captures all of these components in one fluid motion,‚Äù Araujo explained. ‚ÄúIf someone struggles, it may reflect broader issues with inflammation, mobility, or muscle loss‚Äîfactors known to contribute to chronic diseases.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, it‚Äôs not just about the movement. It‚Äôs what that movement reveals about the body‚Äôs inner health, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One lost point = 31% higher risk of death, says study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that every point lost in the test correlated with a 31% increase in mortality risk, even when controlling for age, gender, and BMI. Those who required a hand, knee, or another part of the body for support had lower scores and also higher mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the deaths in this study weren‚Äôt all related to heart disease. Many were from natural causes, such as cancer and age-related decline. This suggests the test reflects overall vitality, not just cardiovascular strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The study has gaps, yet the test still offers &lt;keyword id="27448230" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="real-health-clues" source="Orion"&gt;real health clues&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any study, this one comes with caveats. The participants were all drawn from a private exercise medicine clinic in Rio, meaning they may not represent broader populations, especially people with limited access to healthcare or varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, the study did not account for smoking status, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts agree the findings are worth paying attention to. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a diagnostic test,‚Äù Araujo clarified. ‚ÄúBut it is a practical indicator. It gives people a chance to check in on their physical health without needing to visit a doctor.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Want to try the test yourself? Here‚Äôs how&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt need special equipment to try the sit-and-rise test at home. But Dr. Araujo and his team strongly recommend having a partner nearby, especially for older adults or those with joint problems. Here‚Äôs the step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start in a standing position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross one foot over the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without using your hands, knees, or arms for support, lower yourself to a seated position on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, stand back up again without using support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You begin with 10 points. Subtract 1 point for each time you use your hand, knee, forearm, or side of your leg to help. A loss of balance also subtracts 0.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: If you have knee or hip pain or a recent injury, skip this test. Talk to your physician instead.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why basic movement is a better &lt;keyword id="7809223" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-indicator" source="Orion"&gt;health indicator&lt;/keyword&gt; than you think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often focus on how fast we can run, how much we can lift, or how many steps we take in a day. But this research points to something more fundamental: our capacity for basic movement may tell us more about our ageing process than our mile time ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we grow older, preserving strength, balance, and coordination becomes more important than maximising peak performance. This test puts the spotlight on those quiet, everyday capacities we usually take for granted‚Äîuntil we lose them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your score is a signal, not a sentence: Here‚Äôs what to do next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating this as a pass-or-fail test of mortality, think of it as a red flag system. If you score low, it‚Äôs not a death sentence, it‚Äôs a sign that your body may benefit from more mobility work, strength training, and balance-focused activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercises like yoga, tai chi, resistance training, and even daily walking can help improve the very components this test measures. And unlike fad workouts or supplements, these approaches have well-established benefits for heart health, joint health, and inflammation levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxNckdnelE2dkxxZkZWYXE3R19yY1VabUdZTDRoU1BZbjdwc1lrQ0wzYlU3NXNGTWszWEplQjFiQjgxbld5cDZsVDRrdmphQ2pORHBIYVRKNElXeEdYbHhDLTRXdXp0dVdxYmxQREdUNzFiX3FyLVZHQmpEV1BNUTU3Z1l5eFgxM2U0OW96bUVDSVZxRVAzaDJDZC14UkZUUHJnUXBnaXVTZFAyT3NLRm54amVzSkFidlhvcEpPSDJjS3JuQXRvNkFpakIyc3VPMklqTEFtdi1KRTROMG84RzhzbEJEeThWQVY5aGpvVThYU0Y0UEd5bkFJRlJaaWJLTEpZS2R5UkJqd2hNc09qNjhtcUVn</guid></item><item><title>ËÉÉËÇ†ÁóÖÂ≠¶ÂÆ∂Êé®ËçêÁöÑÊîØÊåÅËÇ†ÈÅìÂÅ•Â∫∑ÁöÑÈ¶ñÈÄâË°•ÂÖÖÂâÇ- EatingWell | The #1 Supplement to Support Gut Health, Recommended by a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFB5MTI1NmRuUjNvZ1ZCbGdHbWx2d2JYRWk0SzdXQlZ5U2tGbDE4ZkkzajBCTkdzdFNhUUdJQXQ1MWNYUTFrSXNNcHZTQzIwblZFMDhSSEV4ajJDY3lHYkhJM21wZFU3RlhLYlowdTU5UHZBcGZiWm44dmlzcjh3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A balanced diet with probiotics, prebiotics, fermented food and a variety of plants is good for your gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need a supplement, consider psyllium husk, a gastroenterologist‚Äôs top supplement pick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psyllium husk supports digestion, lowers inflammation in your gut and increases the good bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to supporting your gut health, diet is key. ‚ÄúFor some folks, it‚Äôs a drag, the fact that their parents were right, but I advise people to try to have a balanced diet,‚Äù says &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/find-a-provider/profile/stephen-bickston" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephen J. Bickston, M.D., AGAF, FACG, FASGE&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to a balanced diet, there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;specific gut-loving foods&lt;/a&gt; you can add, including probiotics, prebiotics, fermented foods and a wide variety of plant-based foods.¬†
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if your diet is in check and you‚Äôre still struggling with gastrointestinal symptoms or just want to better support your gut, you may want to consider a supplement. Bickston‚Äôs go-to? That honor belongs to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; or desert Indian wheat, which comes from the &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plant. ‚ÄúMost people have never heard of it &lt;em&gt;[Plantago ovata],‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; says Bickston. ‚ÄúBut just about everybody‚Äôs heard of Metamucil.‚Äù That‚Äôs right, psyllium husk is the basis of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-fiber-supplements-8420645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;popular fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt;, and it can do your gut some good.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Helps Relieve Both Constipation and Diarrhea &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bickston has dubbed psyllium husk ‚Äúan equalizer for the bowels,‚Äù because consuming the fiber can help with both constipation and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Psyllium is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbs water, creating a gel-like substance. In the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7940041/best-fruit-for-constipation-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;case of constipation&lt;/a&gt;, this gel helps soften the stool, making it easier to poop. This same gel-like substance is what lowers cholesterol levels and helps prevent colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, Bickston explains, ‚ÄúWhen the stool is too runny, fiber sponges up the excess fluid to give it more form. It helps people get to a happy medium.‚Äù
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improves Gut Bacteria &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium contains the prebiotic complex carbohydrate arabinoxylan, which serves as food for the good bacteria in your gut, leading to a proliferation of friendly intestinal microorganisms. This positive boost in gut bacteria can also offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs-11732962" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relief for IBS-constipation symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What‚Äôs good for your gut is often good for your overall health, as is the case here. The good bacteria or probiotics that feed off the prebiotic, arabinoxylan, produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate, which supports your gut and immune health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Patients with IBS have higher levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker. Psyllium decreases &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894310/anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-beginners/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation in the gut&lt;/a&gt; and lowers CRP levels in these patients. At the same time, butyrate, which is produced by bacteria that feed on psyllium, supports the enteric nervous system, improving IBS symptoms. The fiber also improves the intestinal barrier function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Satiety and Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This one doesn‚Äôt exactly better your gut health, but the magic of this benefit certainly happens in your GI tract. Psyllium prevents your stomach from emptying too quickly, which can play a role in managing your appetite. A meta-analysis of six studies found that consuming psyllium fiber before meals (about 10.8 grams per day) led to about a 5-pound &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289462/7-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-1200-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; in less than five months in people with overweight or obesity. They also lost about an inch around their waistline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It‚Äôs worth noting, consuming psyllium husk causes side effects in some people, usually bloating or gas. Start slowly, with a small dose, and add as tolerated. And make sure you‚Äôre drinking enough water throughout the day to prevent new or worsening constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat your cereal: &lt;/strong&gt;It‚Äôs no surprise that Bickston wants you to eat a balanced breakfast. It‚Äôs the best way for your gut to start the day, because many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/153679/how-to-pick-the-healthiest-breakfast-cereal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packaged cereals&lt;/a&gt; already contain psyllium. Check the ingredients list on the label for psyllium or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7884127/how-flaxseed-can-help-digestion-make-you-regular/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;psyllium seed husk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also add psyllium to a hot cereal or overnight oats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a smoothie: &lt;/strong&gt;The best alternative to taking a capsule or gummy-style supplement is purchasing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fiber-supplements-8548491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;psyllium powder&lt;/a&gt; and pouring it into a smoothie or anything else you can think of. ‚ÄúA teaspoon of the psyllium powder is 4 grams of fiber, and it can be added to whatever else someone likes to eat,‚Äù says Bickston. The fiber will help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291987/10-easy-ways-to-make-your-breakfast-smoothie-more-filling/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;add bulk or thicken the smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, similar to ground chia seeds or flaxseed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thicken soups: &lt;/strong&gt;Soups are typically thickened with cornstarch, a roux (flour and butter) or arrowroot. But you can give your soup a boost of fiber by thickening it with psyllium husk powder. Start with adding a tablespoon or less at a time until you reach the desired consistency. Psyllium has an earthy flavor, especially compared to milder options like cornstarch, so make sure to taste-test as you add it.¬†&lt;/li&gt;

But if you‚Äôre experiencing GI symptoms or are falling short on your fiber intake, you may want to consider a gastroenterologist‚Äôs top supplement pick‚Äîpsyllium husk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk can help your gut health by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047475/how-often-should-you-poop/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;normalizing digestion and bowel habits&lt;/a&gt;.

But be sure to talk with your health care provider before starting a new supplement, especially if you‚Äôre experiencing GI symptoms‚Äîthis may be a sign of a more serious issue.&lt;br&gt;

(A green Mediterranean diet is a plant-forward form of the classic Mediterranean diet.) These diets were grouped together as "healthy" diets by the researchers. And while 36 percent of the participants lost more than 5 percent of their initial body weight, 28 percent lost no weight or gained weight‚Äîthese people were considered ‚Äúweight loss resistant.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers discovered that people who lost weight had a bunch of health perks, including an increase in HDL (‚Äúgood‚Äù) cholesterol, a drop in triglycerides (fat in the blood), a drop in the hunger hormone leptin, and a decrease in blood pressure, along with other benefits.

You can absolutely improve your health without losing a pound,‚Äù says Scott Keatley, RD, of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúWhen someone eats a diet rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods, such as fiber-rich vegetables, omega-3 fats, lean proteins, and fermented foods, you see measurable changes.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Why? Health eating can improve cellular function, he explains. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre essentially making your body more efficient at processing fuel, repairing itself, and defending against disease, all without changing body weight,‚Äù Keatley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It‚Äôs also possible for someone‚Äôs weight to stay consistent but for their body composition to change, like adding more muscle while losing fat, he says. ‚ÄúMuscle is denser than fat, so the scale might not move much, but body composition is improving significantly,‚Äù Keatley says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a win. More than anything, it‚Äôs excess fat, particularly visceral fat, that should be the target of a diet, not just weight.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-considered-a-healthy-diet" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;What is considered a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In this particular study, the researchers categorized several diets as "healthy" and specifically chose four (low-carb, low-fat, Mediterranean, and green Mediterranean) that enhanced the participants' metabolic health‚Äîhow well your body converts food into energy‚Äîalong with other health factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;‚ÄúA ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô diet generally refers to a pattern of eating that supports overall well-being, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and provides all essential nutrients for optimal body function,‚Äù says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/anat-yaskolka-meir/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/anat-yaskolka-meir/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anat Yaskolka Meir" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Anat Yaskolka Meir&lt;/a&gt;, RD, PhD, lead study author and a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard T.H.

              &lt;p&gt;If you often have nightmares, you may need to worry a bit more about your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research presented today at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025 links frequent nightmares to faster biological aging and an over three times higher risk of premature death, even when taking into account other medical conditions. The researchers claim to be the first to demonstrate this association, which could have significant implications for how seriously one should consider persistent nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOur sleeping brains cannot distinguish dreams from reality,‚Äù Abidemi Otaiku, a neuroscientist at Imperial College London and presumably an author of a forthcoming study, explained in an EAN &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ean-congress-frequent-nightmares-triple-risk-of-early-death-and-accelerate-ageing-major-study-finds-302484308.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why nightmares often wake us up sweating, gasping for breath, and with our hearts pounding ‚Äì because our fight-or-flight response has been triggered. This stress reaction can be even more intense than anything we experience while awake.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, researchers tracked the nightmare frequency of adults and children (whose nightmares were reported by their parents) for time periods of up to 19 years. Their results demonstrate that both children and adults who often have nightmares experience accelerated biological aging. Adults who suffered from weekly nightmares were also more than three times as likely to die before the age of 70 as those who rarely or never had nightmares, with the faster biological aging accounting for around 40% of that increased early mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúNightmares lead to prolonged elevations of cortisol, a stress hormone closely linked to faster cellular ageing,‚Äù Otaiku added. ‚ÄúFor those who frequently experience nightmares, this cumulative stress may significantly impact the ageing process. Additionally, nightmares disrupt both sleep quality and duration, impairing the body‚Äôs essential overnight cellular restoration and repair. The combined effects of chronic stress and disrupted sleep likely contribute to the accelerated ageing of our cells and bodies.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the link between chronic nightmares and faster aging was consistent in participants of all sexes, ages, mental health statuses, and ethnicities. Biological aging was measured by looking at people‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.630186/full"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, the protective end caps of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are widely considered to be a sign of greater biological age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the research revealed weekly nightmares to more strongly predict early death than other widely known causes, including obesity, smoking, a bad diet, and low physical activity. Even less frequent nightmares, however, had their toll. Participants who reported having them monthly also experienced faster aging and increased premature mortality compared to those who reported rare or no nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As if living through terrifying experiences at night wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the associated health consequences highlighted in the new research carry important implications for how seriously we should take nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if we‚Äôre being honest, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-birds-are-so-stuffed-with-plastic-you-can-hear-them-crunch-2000607662"&gt;the state of plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/industrial-waste-is-turning-into-rock-in-just-decades-study-suggests-2000595525"&gt;human-driven accelerated geological processes&lt;/a&gt; are probably not helping in that category, either.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man was rushed into emergency surgery after his colon 'spontaneously' exploded out of his abdomen following a common surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 83-year-old suffered a 'spontaneous evisceration' of his small intestine - when parts of the intestines burst outside of body - following a hernia repair.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over three feet of his small intestine had burst through a two-inch hole in the skin due to the hernia, when parts of an organ bulge through a weak muscle or tissue.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The protruding bowel had also become twisted, cutting off crucial blood supply.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though evisceration of the bowel is rare, hernias strike 5million Americans a year. Over 1million hernia repairs are performed a year, making it one of the most common operations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent similar cases have included patients whose intestines &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14824901/Womans-colon-EXPLODES-body-coughing-hard-cold.html"&gt;burst through their body because they coughed too hard&lt;/a&gt; or suffered trauma like a stab wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the Romanian man's doctors said he had no history of coughing fits or trauma, though he had multiple hernias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's estimated no more than 100 cases of evisceration have been reported in medical literature, and cases like the unnamed man's have been seen just a handful of times, the doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man in Romania's small intestine spontaneously exploded out of his body after he suffered a hernia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the man wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/949330/s/B"&gt;medical journal&lt;/a&gt;: 'Evisceration of intra-abdominal organs is a rare, serious event.'¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote the condition is most often caused by traumatic injuries like stab or gunshot wounds or from a sudden increase in abdominal pressure. This may be caused by coughing or heavy lifting.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These factors may thin and weaken the abdominal lining, making it less protective.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unnamed man was a rectal cancer survivor, and the hernia had formed near his stoma, a surgical opening that helps waste pass into a collection bag instead of through the anus.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had already had one of these hernias, a parastomal hernia, repaired two years prior.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons fix a hernia by pushing the protruding tissue back in place and then closing up the weakened part of the abdominal wall.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After seeing the extent of the man's evisceration, doctors transferred him to Military Clinical Emergency Hospital Sibiu in Romania from his local hospital in February 2025.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he was admitted, it had been six hours since the intestine initially burst.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the injury, he was conscious and alert the entire time.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a CT scan of the man's hernia taken one month before is spontaneously exploded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors removed the last part of the small intestine, the ileum, and connected it to the large intestine - the colon - to repair the damage. They also corrected the opening in the man's stoma.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man was discharged eight days after surgery.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors treating the man said only a handful of cases have been reported of spontaneous evisceration from a parastomal hernia.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of them involved patients with rectal cancer who had to receive a colostomy bag, and many suffered the injury due to intense coughing.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4039678/"&gt;2012 case&lt;/a&gt;, a 62-year-old rectal cancer survivor from Turkey was admitted to the hospital after suffering abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting and swelling around the site of his colostomy operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vomiting and coughing caused the spontaneous evisceration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2012 case was believed to be the first official report of parastomal evisceration.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Experts hope tests will be used after diagnosis to classify patients as either ‚Äúchemotherapy resistant‚Äù or ‚Äúchemotherapy sensitive‚Äù to treatments, to avoid giving them therapies that will not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Iain Foulkes, the executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, which helped fund the research, said: ‚ÄúThe days of chemotherapy being offered as a ‚Äòone-size-fits-all‚Äô treatment are ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThanks to this research, we are moving towards a future where &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/31/nhs-patients-personalised-cancer-vaccines-world-first-trial/"&gt;personalised cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; is an option for many patients. Only by delivering more optimised, successful treatment will more people live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now working with the pharmaceutical industry to develop the test and will be applying to regulators for its use in the clinic. They are also developing further tests for other targeted cancer drugs to find out how widely the technology could be used across different cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ania Piskorz, the head of genomics at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and the co-lead author, said: ‚ÄúIt was important to us to create a test that could be easily adopted in the clinic, using material we already collect during diagnosis and well-established genomic sequencing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe test is based on the full DNA sequence that we get from these methods, and we can adapt it to work alongside other genomic sequencing methods that are commonly used to personalise treatment for cancer.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal Nature Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, it could be carried out in the presence of living cells without harming them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team made their discovery when they took polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ‚Äì a type of plastic often found in food packaging and bottles ‚Äì and, using sustainable chemical methods, converted it into a new material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers incubated this material with a harmless strain of E coli they found it was converted into another substance known as Paba in a process that must have involved a Lossen rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Crucially, while the Lossen rearrangement typically involves harsh laboratory conditions, it occurred spontaneously in the presence of the E coli, with the researchers discovering it was catalysed by phosphate within the cells themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team add that Paba is an essential substance that bacteria need for growth, in particular the synthesis of DNA, and is usually made within the cell from other substances. However, the E coli used in the experiments was genetically modified to block these pathways, meaning the bacteria had to use the PET-based material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers say the results are exciting as they suggest plastic waste can be converted into biological material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;‚ÄúIt is a way to just completely hoover up plastic waste,‚Äù said Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers then genetically modified the E coli further, inserting two genes ‚Äì one from mushrooms and one from soil bacteria ‚Äì that enabled the bacteria to convert PABA into paracetamol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team say that by using this form of E coli they were able to turn the PET-based starting material into paracetamol in under 24 hours, with low emissions and a yield of up to 92%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While further work would be needed to produce paracetamol in this way at commercial levels, the results could have a practical application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;‚ÄúIt enables, for the first time, a pathway from plastic waste to paracetamol, which is not possible using biology alone, and it‚Äôs not possible using chemistry alone,‚Äù Wallace said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPX3YxaVVDcUp3cjlvSzVFYVExUENkZFJrYk1mWGI3X3FHZndKdm9QS0ZWMm1GRGl0S21tX3g4ejhYT0x6UjdDUnhQakphajZXTUJDMnhNd0NESTFfRTVkR0x1cjlkdjRIZTVQMWdHZmFrU3FIelN4YXVhSHFIU0tFN09wS0VqcUhldmhlc2kxSHZZclZrdzB4bVExVGdpYXVENEZINm5UQXpSRkRPLVd6NlVVdnRyWkF4ZTMzY0ZZY0lIX05ac1Uw</guid></item><item><title>‰∏ìÊ†è|Êàë‰ª¨ÈóÆ‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰ΩçËÇøÁò§Â≠¶ÂÆ∂ÔºöÊàë‰ª¨ÊòØÂê¶Â∫îËØ•ÊãÖÂøÉÂÜÖÂàÜÊ≥åÂπ≤Êâ∞Áâ©Ôºü -„ÄäÂçéÁõõÈ°øÈÇÆÊä•„Äã | Column | We asked an oncologist: Should we worry about endocrine disruptors? - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQSmxRbWUyLVQxVmFBckZOc0NKbmhXZEtvbzc3dmo1SG41MGxYS3BQSUtfNndMeUFtYUpKd3pMbnUwN09wQTRJRHNteWNQdmhHaDNxXzlJNGJOZU1JNldIMkJjb0MzOVlLRGU0MTFqSkluc0Qwcl9sQ0xSZHpwT1BEV29DbjhoUHNPV1BXSE9tZ3otZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUUPKC3J2JBYBINCSDWANRBAHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you‚Äôve been on social media lately, chances are you‚Äôve heard about endocrine disruptors.

They‚Äôre also known as ‚Äúforever chemicals,‚Äù because once PFAS are created, they persist in the environment because they do not break down like some other chemicals. PFAS can be found in everything from some types of dental floss to certain &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/08/10/forever-chemicals-pfas-period-underwear-tampons/" target="_blank"&gt;menstrual products&lt;/a&gt;.

And last year, the Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/04/10/pfas-drinking-water-epa-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;set limits&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of PFAS in drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CPD4H7BOCJBAFONKKVYSF2FK3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But because PFAS are so ubiquitous, they can be hard to avoid.

A more recent study in the same cohort found that any use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36245087/" target="_blank"&gt;straightening products&lt;/a&gt; within the previous year was linked to an increased the risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KFRKQ66QHFE3TG27ASBC3MKR6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Keep in mind that the overall excess cancer risk is still really low. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, approximately one in eight women, or 13 percent, will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. Permanent dye use may increase that risk by 9 percent, from 13 percent to 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NA5DFIMWBNGVZL2AD5ACUEOE4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Further research is needed to determine whether phthalates are the concern in these products, or if another chemical or factor may be a culprit. In the meantime, I recommend checking to see if your beauty products such as shampoo or chemical hair products contain phthalates, or looking for phthalate-free products. Another option is to choose &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/02/phthalates-perfume-safe-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;fragrance-free products&lt;/a&gt; and avoid perfumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TH5VSQWRI5HJTHEREA4ABXAUHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are everywhere, and we may learn more in coming years to implicate them more directly as a cancer risk factor. In the meantime, here‚Äôs my advice: Focus on taking steps for reducing cancer risk that are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/27/decrease-risk-cancer-science/" target="_blank"&gt;backed by stronger evidence&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A shocking MailOnline investigation last year even uncovered vapes resembling sweets and high street stores selling the devices next to chocolate and fruit gummies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had serious pains where my kidney and liver are.

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs according to findings from a proof-of-concept &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05981040"&gt;Phase 2a trial (NCT05981040)&lt;/a&gt; in India that tested Zydus‚Äô usnoflast in 24 adults with ALS. The therapy achieved therapeutic levels in the spinal fluid in most participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, ‚Äú&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21678421.2025.2515900"&gt;A phase 2, proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Usnoflast (ZYIL1) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,‚Äù was published in &lt;em&gt;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Degeneration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usnoflast is designed to reduce inflammation that contributes to nerve cell damage and death in ALS by blocking the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a group of proteins that detect danger signals and initiate immune responses to fight the invaders. NLRP3 is overactive in ALS, making it a promising target for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy was recently granted &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/zydus-usnoflast-wins-fdas-fast-track-drug-designation-treating-als/"&gt;fast track status&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. for ALS. That designation is meant to accelerate the development of treatments for serious or life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usnoflast was first tested in healthy volunteers at single and multiple ascending doses in two Phase 1 trials, where it was &lt;a href="https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpdd.1162"&gt;well tolerated&lt;/a&gt; and reduced blood levels of pro-inflammatory molecules associated with NLRP3 activation, indicating it worked as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phase 2a trial was launched to determine the safety and efficacy of usnoflast in people with ALS. Its participants, who‚Äôd been living with &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-als-2/"&gt;ALS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; for up to nine months, were randomly assigned to one of three doses (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg), or a placebo, twice daily for about three months. The patients had a mean age of 51, and most were women, but the researchers noted those given a placebo were about 15-21 years younger than those given usnoflast. During the trial, all the participants continued their standard ALS treatment with riluzole (sold as &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/tiglutik-riluzole-oral-suspension/"&gt;Tiglutik&lt;/a&gt;, among others) alone or with edaravone (sold as &lt;a href="https://www.radicava.com/patient/"&gt;Radicava&lt;/a&gt; and Radicava ORS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Testing efficacy of usnoflast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal was to see if usnoflast could slow functional decline, as assessed with the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), after 12 weeks. While no significant differences were observed between any usnoflast dose and the placebo, there were trends toward a slower disease progression with the active treatment. For example, those given a placebo lost 2.26 points in their ALSFRS-R scores over 12 weeks, those given the 25 mg dose lost 1.91 points, and those assigned the 75 mg dose actually saw their scores increase by a mean of 0.52 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the 50 mg and 75 mg doses tended to improve lung function, while the placebo group saw a decline in lung function over 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from pharmacological studies showed that most patients with available data (71%) had usnoflast levels in the spinal fluid that were considered therapeutically relevant. However, reductions in neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of nerve damage, were only seen in those given the higher dose, and even those weren‚Äôt significantly different from a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe older age and faster disease progression of patients given usnoflast may have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usnoflast was generally well tolerated, with the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent side effects being similar across all four study arms. The most common side effects were urinary tract infections and increases in liver enzymes. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúBeing a [proof-of-concept] study, this trial was designed with small sample size and small study duration,‚Äù the researchers wrote. ‚ÄúAlthough the primary and secondary outcomes of this study were not significant, observed [pharmacological] and safety results ‚Ä¶ support a larger and longer study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of usnoflast.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zydus has been &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/zydus-cleared-begin-us-trial-oral-therapy-usnoflast-als/"&gt;cleared to initiate&lt;/a&gt; a Phase 2b trial in the U.S. to test eight months of treatment with the 50 and 75 mg doses in about 210 adults with ALS. An open-label extension lasting four months may then follow the trial.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One pint a few times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two pints of high-strength beer or cider; three pints of low-strength beer or cider; two large glasses of wine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six units of alcohol ‚Äì under one unit per day ‚Äì is the most that you can drink in a week, as a man, without significantly increasing your risk of liver cancer. Doing so will still increase your risk of mouth or throat cancer, however, by 13 per cent, according to Dr Rumgay‚Äôs estimates. If you smoke and drink at the same time, ‚Äúthere is lots of evidence to say that you are making both activities more dangerous in terms of your cancer risk,‚Äù Dr Rumgay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking to fewer than one unit per day on average is much safer when it comes to cancer risk than exceeding this limit, however, ‚Äúas your risk of developing any cancer increases with each unit you drink per day,‚Äù says Dr Croker. That means having no more than two pints of high-strength beer or cider or three pints of low-strength beer or cider in a week. Again, Dr Rumgay recommends keeping a close eye on your units wherever possible, and choosing lower-strength drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One pint a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of drinking regularly but having fewer than one unit a day on average ‚Äúare less well understood‚Äù, says Dr Croker. We do know, however, that while drinking this much will not significantly increase your risk of colorectal or liver cancer, having one three-unit pint every week, on average, will increase your risk of mouth cancer by 5 per cent, says Dr Rumgay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 57 per cent of British men drink alcohol at least once a week, according to an NHS survey. ‚ÄúReducing your alcohol consumption by swapping out your pint for a non-alcoholic drink would be a very good move for your health, if it means that it allows you to keep socialising and enjoying yourself without consuming more alcohol,‚Äù Dr Rumgay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One pint a few times a year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having one three-unit pint every few weeks, on average, would increase your risk of mouth or throat cancer by 4 per cent, according to Dr Rumgay. Having a pint every few months, meanwhile, would increase your risk of mouth or throat cancer by just 0.4 per cent. Neither drinking pattern would cause a significant increase in your risk of colorectal or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while no amount of drinking is completely safe, you may be pleased to know that celebrating with a pint or few a couple of weekends a year will up your cancer risk only marginally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What these statistics mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following risk estimates have been provided by Dr Rumgay. They are based on the lifetime risk of different cancers among men who don‚Äôt drink at all. For colorectal cancer in men, this is 6.5 per cent, while the lifetime risk of mouth or throat cancer is 0.8 per cent, and the lifetime risk of liver cancer is also 0.8 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combines with the additional risk posed by how many grams of alcohol you drink per day on average to give your ‚Äúabsolute risk‚Äù, not taking into account your health in general. Where we talk about a number of men out of 100 who will develop one of these cancers in their lifetime, we have rounded it to the nearest whole number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many other factors that increase a man‚Äôs risk of cancer, such as smoking, being overweight, or having a family history of the disease. All these factors mean that you may be at an increased or decreased risk from drinking compared with other men who consume a similar amount of alcohol to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures compare the ‚Äúrelative risk‚Äù of different groups of men and don‚Äôt reflect your personal risk as a whole. For this reason, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre young, maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly, then the risk posed to you by drinking alcohol is lower, but any amount is still dangerous,‚Äù Dr Rumgay says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to say no to another drink ‚Äì by Prof Richard Cooke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men find it much harder than women to say no to ‚Äúanother one‚Äù. The WCRF‚Äôs recent survey found that a quarter of men worry about being judged or being seen as boring when they say no to alcohol, and one in five of us has called in sick the day after a weekday night out as we can‚Äôt make it into work (compared with just one in 10 women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that men rely on excuses more than women ‚Äì half of men have made an excuse not to drink, compared with 40 per cent of women. My work as a health psychologist shows that coming up with a reason that‚Äôs personal to you when you‚Äôre turning down a drink is the best way to stick to your guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Work out why you‚Äôre doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decide why it is that you want to drink a bit less ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs to reduce your cancer risk or feel clearer-headed on Sunday morning. (Tip: avoid saying something such as you want to save money or that you‚Äôre trying to lose weight, because research suggests that these reasons are quite easy to counteract, by other people buying you a drink, or saying something such as, ‚ÄúThe diet can wait!‚Äù) Instead, choose something that‚Äôs specific to you, something that you care about, as your reason to reduce your drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Explain it to people confidently&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that when you explain clearly and confidently why you don‚Äôt want another pint, people are more likely to accept your explanation and less likely to push you to drink. Just over 10 per cent of men choose to say that they are trying to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/ten-exercise-steps-to-get-fit-from-scratch/"&gt;get fitter&lt;/a&gt; or need to avoid a hangover to make it to the gym the next day, and for them, this seems to work well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Try different moderation techniques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to drink less without suffering the feeling of missing out. One is to try low-and-no drinks that look very similar to alcoholic drinks, which can be especially helpful if you struggle with peer pressure (though the jury is out on whether these may increase drinking in the long term). Another is bookending: starting and ending the night with soft drinks and having alcoholic drinks in the middle. Giving a few a go and seeing what works for you can be a big help.&lt;/p&gt;

You‚Äôre wiser, more confident and unapologetically yourself. But let‚Äôs be honest. Our bodies and minds don‚Äôt exactly operate like they did in our 20s. From &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917238/heres-what-happens-to-your-hormones-as-you-age/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fluctuating hormones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fluctuating hormones&lt;/a&gt; to the occasional creaking bones and aching joints, it‚Äôs clear that self-care needs to take center stage. And what better time to give yourself some TLC than right before bed? After all, your &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-for-healthy-aging-11712308" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:evening routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;evening routine&lt;/a&gt; can set the tone for &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, mental clarity and a healthier tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get you started, we reached out to registered dietitians for simple yet effective ways women over 50 can optimize their nights. These aren‚Äôt complicated rituals or time-consuming chores. They are just six practical, doable habits to help you wind down your day while doing something good for your body and mind at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Sip an Alcohol-Free Mocktail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alcohol-containing drink;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;alcohol-containing drink&lt;/a&gt; in the evening, consider swapping it for a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7967514/healthy-summer-mocktails-for-mocktail-summer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:booze-free mocktail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;booze-free mocktail&lt;/a&gt; or a glass of alcohol-free wine or beer. ‚ÄúMost women over age 50 complain of insomnia and sleep disturbances due to perimenopause and menopause,‚Äù says &lt;a href="https://thehormonedietitian.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Azzaro, RDN, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Azzaro, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúSymptoms like hot flashes and night sweats can keep women up, and other hormone imbalances can make it difficult to get a full night of quality sleep.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why she recommends that women over 50 cut out alcohol before bed. ‚ÄúWhile you may feel that it helps you fall asleep faster, it results in more interrupted, less restful sleep,‚Äù she says. Research agrees, linking higher alcohol consumption to shorter, less &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:restorative sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;restorative sleep&lt;/a&gt; and even snoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Eat a Protein-Rich Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúAfter 50, women lose muscle mass more rapidly due to hormonal shifts, specifically [due to] a decline in estrogen levels during menopause, which affects bone density and muscle strength,‚Äù says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúProtein before bed‚Äîsuch as Greek yogurt, cottage cheese or a plant-based protein smoothie‚Äî[has been shown to] support overnight muscle repair and synthesis, especially when paired with resistance exercise.‚Äù For example, one study found that men who ate protein after working out in the evening had higher rates of muscle building and repair than those who performed evening exercise without consuming protein. While we can‚Äôt say for sure that the same would be true for women, a healthy, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8062726/dietitian-favorite-high-protein-snack-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein-rich bedtime snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;protein-rich bedtime snack&lt;/a&gt; is worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Brush Your Teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you‚Äôve had your snack, it‚Äôs time to brush those teeth‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre tired and can‚Äôt motivate! Brushing before bed is important for everyone. But it becomes even more critical as you enter your 50s as oral health becomes increasingly tied to your overall health as you age. Problems like dry mouth, tooth loss, cavities, gum disease and oral cancer are more common in older people and can affect more than just their teeth. They can also lead to issues like poor nutrition and lower quality of life and can even worsen conditions like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease or diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart disease or diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, when your teeth are in good shape, it‚Äôs easier‚Äîand more enjoyable‚Äîto eat &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy foods like fruits and veggies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;healthy foods like fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Put a Glass of Water by Your Bedside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple act of having a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-tonight-if-you-didnt-drink-enough-water-11755822" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glass of water by your bedside;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;glass of water by your bedside&lt;/a&gt; could be one of the most underrated habits for women who are over age 50. ‚ÄúEven if you don‚Äôt wake up in the night, night sweats can dehydrate you during sleep, so you are most likely waking up somewhat dehydrated,‚Äù explains &lt;a href="https://www.franceslargemanroth.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúHaving the water right there next to you helps you get a jump on hydration for the day, which helps you feel your best.‚Äù And if hot flashes are an issue, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7870247/what-happens-when-you-drink-more-water/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sipping cold water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;sipping cold water&lt;/a&gt; before you hit the hay might help cool things off, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Take Magnesium Glycinate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays a crucial role in muscle relaxation, maintaining a healthy nervous system and regulating sleep. Yet, as we age, we may not absorb this mineral as efficiently as we did when we were younger. And many of us don‚Äôt consume enough magnesium to meet our needs. Enter magnesium glycinate. This highly absorbable form of magnesium is readily taken up by the body for more restful sleep and overall relaxation at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond sleep, this supplement may aid in maintaining strong bones, as magnesium is essential for &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-take-calcium-supplements-for-maximum-absorption-11750003" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calcium absorption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;calcium absorption&lt;/a&gt; and bone mineralization. Prioritizing bone health becomes increasingly important after age 50 to reduce the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-7-best-foods-for-osteoporosis-8706086" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of osteoporosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; and maintain overall mobility. Research shows that higher magnesium intake is linked to better bone density in the hip and femoral neck, which are key areas for mobility and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Practice Diaphragmatic Breathing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diaphragmatic breathing, or deep belly breathing, is a simple way to calm your body and mind. ‚ÄúThis slow, intentional breathing‚Äîinhale through the nose with a deep belly expansion followed by a slow exhale‚Äî can calm the nervous system and may promote better sleep,‚Äù says &lt;a href="https://www.eatsimplynutrition.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brittany Scanniello, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brittany Scanniello, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may also support your long-term heart health. How so? Stress is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, which is a leading cause of death for older women. Promising research has shown that diaphragmatic breathing can &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903638/science-backed-ways-to-be-happier-amp-reduce-stress-that-are-easy-and-free/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce stress levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduce stress levels&lt;/a&gt; by improving blood pressure and respiratory rate and lowering the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress hormone cortisol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;stress hormone cortisol&lt;/a&gt;. While more research is needed, taking a few deep belly breaths before turning in could be an easy, low-cost way to ease your stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your nighttime habits can be an impactful way to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-women-over-50-should-every-morning-11695945" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prioritize self-care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;prioritize self-care&lt;/a&gt; and support your body through the changes that happen after age 50. Whether you recently turned 50 or have already passed this milestone, dietitians recommend making the most of your evenings by &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-stop-drinking-alcohol-8773934" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:swapping out alcohol for mocktails;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;swapping out alcohol for mocktails&lt;/a&gt;, eating a protein-rich bedtime snack and &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-help-this-dietitian-stay-hydrated-11753491" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:staying hydrated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;staying hydrated&lt;/a&gt;. They also recommend taking a magnesium glycinate supplement and doing some deep-breathing exercises to help you wind down and prepare for restorative sleep. And don‚Äôt forget to brush those teeth! As you age, your dental health impacts multiple aspects of your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, small changes can lead to big results over time. By choosing to nurture your body and mind in these practical ways, you‚Äôre setting the foundation for healthier days and more peaceful nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-women-over-50-should-do-before-bed-11757559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBJSmZzQ2txcUxHS0tWekNxcVJ0RVA1SmdFSWt3a2N1MFNqN2ctS2pIWmpTbUNGTXJraVJJM2k5eDA5N3JNbm55TGxvY09XM3lJUjl1TTVnbVVCTS1sV1R5ZGg1S0FQYU5W</guid></item><item><title>Á†îÁ©∂Ë°®ÊòéÔºåÁå´ÂØÑÁîüËô´‰ºö‰∏•ÈáçÁ†¥ÂùèÂ§ßËÑëÂäüËÉΩ- ScienceAlert | Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPc1EwZUFqNTdkUGxjdUdKVlowa2tZZ2c4bDA1YnEyR3dQaW03SU1HN2h1YTk1X2NWTHhhdXpBV2YyVmdFMXgyaEszN1RoXzllbWlZSDc0V1Q1Qm9PemZQd3dVQzNtX0hJSDRqTExTQ2ZuS0t1X05pdUhLcThSZkhJdWZ1czZtNGk1eGZ3bVJzbEwzeFJlRldEYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Infection with a common parasite can seriously disrupt the brain function of intermediate hosts ‚Äì potentially including humans ‚Äì new research has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when the number of neurons affected is relatively small, toxoplasmosis ‚Äì infection with the parasite &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì strongly interferes with neuronal communication. That's &lt;span&gt;revealed by a study involving mouse brain cells, some grown in a dish and some collected from living animals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons infected with the parasite release fewer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_vesicle"&gt;extracellular vesicles&lt;/a&gt; (EVs), tiny lipid-bound packets of proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites that are used as a means of intercellular communication. It's a finding that carries a lot of weight in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-little-evidence-that-the-infamous-cat-parasite-causes-psychological-changes-in-humans-study-finds"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; on the behavioral impact of toxoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasites-may-be-hijacking-evolution-on-planet-earth?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parasites May Be Hijacking Evolution on Planet Earth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment," &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication"&gt;says parasite immunologist Emma Wilson&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California Riverside School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain's neurochemical balance. This suggests that communication between neurons and supporting glial cells is not only critical, but also vulnerable to hijacking by parasites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a parasite known for wreaking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-figured-out-how-a-parasite-transmitted-by-cats-may-alter-our-behaviour"&gt;behavioral changes&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-strange-happens-to-wolves-infected-by-an-infamous-mind-altering-parasite"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-parasite-has-been-linked-to-an-increased-risk-of-rage-disorder"&gt;worse&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äì in its hosts. It likes to find a cell and nestle inside, and the types of cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasite-infecting-one-in-three-people-really-likes-the-retina-scientists-say"&gt;it likes most&lt;/a&gt; are neurons, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-invading-parasite-could-be-hacked-to-deliver-meds-in-your-head"&gt;crossing the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; to get there. Once inside, the protozoan can hunker down for decades, just hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's one of the most successful parasites on the planet, and there are few warm-blooded species it can't invade. However, it can only reproduce in cats; research suggests that some of the behavioral changes exhibited by infected organisms are to force them into an increased likelihood of encountering cats, such as rodents suddenly wanting to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0608310104"&gt;seek out the smell of cat pee&lt;/a&gt; instead of avoiding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies have found that the evidence for such behavioral manipulation is circumstantial, and that we &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2013.01.004"&gt;can't conclusively link&lt;/a&gt; these changes to the parasite. It's especially complicated for humans; behavior is complex, and it's difficult to attribute changes to any one cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165305" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/toxo-cysts.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-165305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/toxo-cysts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/toxo-cysts-600x371.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165305" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Toxoplasmosis is particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients.

The researchers infected mouse neurons with &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;, and carefully analyzed the production and content of EVs, comparing it against EV production in healthy, uninfected neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that not only was EV production reduced, the content of the packets was altered compared to those produced by healthy neurons. Since the role of EVs is to relay information between neurons and astrocytes, this had a knock-on effect: the astrocyte gene expression was also altered, resulting in increased production of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom5043087"&gt;specific immune signatures&lt;/a&gt;, and a decrease in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2019.03.002"&gt;transporter&lt;/a&gt; that helps remove excess glutamate from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess glutamate is linked to problems such as seizures and neural damage, complications that are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9756-toxoplasmosis"&gt;known to arise&lt;/a&gt; from severe cases of toxoplasmosis. This suggests that we might be underestimating the impact of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and behavioral conditions than we previously thought," &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication"&gt;Wilson says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shockingly large number of humans harbor &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt;.

Meanwhile, research such as Wilson's may help us better understand the parasites, and work on ways of protecting ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our brains have built-in defenses that may recognize and respond to neurons infected by &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;," &lt;a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2025/06/18/how-common-brain-parasite-disrupts-neural-communication"&gt;she says&lt;/a&gt;. "If we can learn how to support or enhance that process, we may be able to better protect people, especially the most vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Pathogens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The benefits of creatine include improved strength and power, enhanced recovery, support for lean muscle growth, and better performance in high-intensity training.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Tushar Tayal busted several myths associated with creatine supplements:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: Creatine leads to weight gain.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: While it‚Äôs true that creatine can cause a slight increase in body weight, this is primarily due to water retention within the muscle cells rather than fat gain. When creatine is taken, it pulls water into the muscles, making them appear fuller and more hydrated. This may result in a weight increase of around 1‚Äì2 kg during the first week, which is completely normal and not indicative of fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 2: Creatine causes bloating or damages the kidneys.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: When taken in recommended doses by healthy individuals, creatine is safe for long-term use. Bloating is uncommon and usually associated with excessive intake or insufficient hydration. As for kidney health, multiple long-term studies have shown no negative impact in people with normal kidney function. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kidneyfriendly-diet-to-lower-your-creatinine-levels-promote-overall-kidney-health-101697185519262.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney-friendly diet to lower your creatinine levels, promote overall kidney health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney-friendly diet to lower your creatinine levels, promote overall kidney health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/23/original/containers-dumbbells-arrangement_1750673586624.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Creatine does not cause bloating." title="Creatine does not cause bloating."&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Creatine does not cause bloating.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: Creatine is a steroid or illegal performance enhancer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Creatine is not a steroid. It is a naturally occurring compound found in small amounts in foods like red meat and fish and is also produced by the body. Creatine supplements simply help saturate the muscles with more of what the body already uses for quick energy during high-intensity activities. It is completely legal and widely studied, with consistent evidence supporting its effectiveness and safety for both athletic and general health use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Myth 4: You have to cycle on and off creatine to avoid side effects.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no scientific evidence suggesting that cycling creatine (i.e., taking breaks after a period of use) is necessary for safety or effectiveness. Creatine does not suppress natural production in the way anabolic steroids do, and long-term daily use (at recommended doses) has been shown to be safe for healthy individuals. That said, some people choose to cycle for personal preference or budget reasons, but it's not a requirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tips to use creatine supplement in daily routine:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be consistent&lt;/strong&gt;: To incorporate creatine into a daily routine, consistency is key. Many people begin with a loading phase of 20 grams per day (split into 4 doses) for about 5 to 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 3 to 5 grams daily. Others skip the loading phase and stick to 3 to 5 grams a day from the start, which also works well though results may appear more gradually.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-workout consumption&lt;/strong&gt;: Creatine can be taken at any time of the day but consuming it post-workout with carbohydrates and protein may improve its absorption. It‚Äôs best to choose creatine monohydrate, which is the most researched and effective form available. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-6-essential-supplements-and-why-they-are-important-in-your-30s-collagen-to-magnesium-101747287122879.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Doctor shares 6 essential supplements and why they are important in your 30s: Collagen to magnesium"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor shares 6 essential supplements and why they are important in your 30s: Collagen to magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Staying well-hydrated is important while using creatine, as it increases water retention in the muscles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

From sugar-packed protein bars to popcorn fortified with the important macronutrient, you might be surprised to learn that most &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein" target="_blank"&gt;Americans actually get plenty of protein&lt;/a&gt; in their diets or even eat excess amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89854c" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, high-protein diets are all over TikTok and other social media platforms, with supporters claiming they can help with energy, muscle-building and more. While protein can help you feel full and is crucial for many roles in the body, there are some risks associated with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-much-protein-is-too-much-rcna156560" target="_blank"&gt;eating too much protein&lt;/a&gt;, such as kidney problems, dehydration and digestive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2923e1" class="body-graf"&gt;And focusing on protein may lead you to deprioritize other equally important nutrients, which can be a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6a2af4" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Include Fiber in High-Protein Diets &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b42a33" class="body-graf"&gt;‚ÄúA lot of times when people are on a high-protein diet, they‚Äôre eliminating other sources of food,‚Äù Christina Fasulo, a dietitian at UCLA Health, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/high-protein-diet-fiber-increase-why-rcna209765" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. ‚ÄúMost people need to have a set amount of fiber in their diet, and a lot of that is getting displaced by a high protein diet.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edc252" class="body-graf"&gt;Americans should be consuming 25-38 grams of fiber per day, but  5% of men and 9% of women consume the recommended amount of fiber daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e422dc" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a43ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating enough fiber ‚Äî both soluble and insoluble ‚Äî improves health in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670350" class="body-graf"&gt;Soluble fiber, the type found in seeds, beans and lentils, ‚Äúis kind of like a sponge, where it‚Äôs slowing things down that are passing through our digestive tract,‚Äù Fasulo said.

But what actually is a stroke?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;, "a stroke is when blood stops flowing to a part of your brain. It can affect things like speech and movement, and it can take a long time to recover. A stroke needs urgent &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/cancer-heart-disease-high-blood-31913050" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;medical help&lt;/a&gt; in a hospital because it can be life-threatening." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, many strokes are largely preventable, especially with healthy lifestyle choices, including what you eat. Health expert, Vanessa King, M.S., RDN, shared: "Eating well plays a supportive role in reducing stroke risk and supporting recovery after a stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Medical studies have shown that "those with the highest-quality diets (as determined by the Alternative Healthy Eating Index) had a 40% lower risk of stroke compared to those with the lowest-quality diets," reported &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Eating Well.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, regularly eating just four common foods, including one unexpected caffeinated drink, may significantly reduce your risk of stroke. These aren‚Äôt exotic superfoods that are hard to find; they are everyday items you might already have in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Five foods that help reduce the stroke of stroke&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31913899" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;1. Salmon&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt; Fish is a major superfood for the brain. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and other heart-healthy nutrients that can help lower blood pressure and support the health of your blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health expert Vanessa highlighted: "Three ounces of cooked salmon is a great source of vitamins B6 and B12, providing 23% of the Daily Value of B6 and over 100% of the Daily Value of B12."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These B vitamins may lower total blood homocysteine concentrations‚Äîa key risk factor for stroke." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expert recommends eating salmon with salads like Salad Ni√ßoise or making a baked dish. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31913910" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;2. Chickpeas&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chickpeas are packed with nutrients that support brain health. Their high fibre and protein content is one of the biggest reasons why they may help reduce stroke risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vanessa shared: "A cup of these versatile beans adds 10% of the Daily Value of homocysteine-lowering vitamin B6. And since they come conveniently precooked, it‚Äôs easy to crack open a can to upgrade nutrition in your meals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They serve as a fibre-rich protein source for stews, salads, curries and snacks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31913932" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="author"&gt; (Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;3. Soy foods&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking to Eating Well, another health expert, Amy Brownstein, debunked misconceptions about soy food&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said: "Soy proteins lower blood pressure. They‚Äôre naturally low in fat, and compounds like phytoestrogens and isoflavones positively influence blood pressure by potentially relaxing blood vessels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, meat eaters do not need to completely change their diet to soy to promote positive blood pressure, but the expert recommends replacing one meat-based meal a week with a soy dish. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31913958" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;4. Spinach&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt; Spinach is one of the best greens to incorporate into your diet as its nutrients, such as potassium, magnesium, and folate, help promote blood flow into your brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A half-cup of cooked spinach is a great source of folate and a good source of magnesium," said Vanessa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stroke/foods-that-prevent-stroke#5-foods" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, when you eat leafy greens such as spinach, your body converts the nitrates into nitric oxide, which plays an important role in regulating blood flow and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A 2021 study found that consuming at least 60 milligrams (mg) per day of vegetable nitrate (1 cup of leafy green vegetables) led to a 17% reduced risk of ischemic stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31913975" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="author"&gt; (Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;5. Coffee&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt; Surprisingly, health experts have recommended drinking coffee as a part of a healthy diet due to its ability to lower blood pressure levels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy Brownstein highlighted: "Besides its caffeine content, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/women-aging-coffee-study-11748151" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;coffee is a significant source of polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; like chlorogenic acid, which may contribute to lower blood pressure levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, limiting your sweeteners is recommended as studies show that added sugars can contribute to stroke risk. Too much sugar can also lead to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes can increase the risk of a stroke because having too much sugar in the blood damages the blood vessels, according to &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/managing-risk/diabetes" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stroke.org. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQeUFnejlEMWRIcW5HNXRUTy04eHVDSlRGNmxJdDB5cEU0b1F5eDB6ZXhUN2E2cmcxTEFJOGdwZUZxTVVobWgtSUxtcXZtdlRWQ04xS3pZeXhSQS02ZGpWTXdDQ3d4VXdWRWZvVEJzY2pvR01aZTZPOUhtNW4wUjRlYzhjYlRwQzVNVG1R</guid></item><item><title>ËÜùÁõñÁñºÁóõÔºü Shriram NeneÂçöÂ£´ÂàÜ‰∫´‰∫Ü6‰∏™ÂèØ‰ª•ÊåΩÊïëÂÖ≥ËäÇÁöÑÊäÄÂ∑ß- financialexpress.com | Struggling with knee pain?

From climbing stairs to walking long distances, aching knees can make even the simplest tasks difficult. But the good news is that most knee problems can be prevented or managed with the right care.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Shriram Nene, who is also the husband of Bollywood diva Madhuri Dixit took to social media to share simple, practical tips to support knee health. In his Instagram post, he explained six easy strategies to strengthen the knees, reduce pain, and prevent long-term joint damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;


&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúStrong knees, strong life! Don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs too late‚Äîstart caring today for a pain-free tomorrow,‚Äù he wrote in his caption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a look at the six expert-backed tips for healthy knees:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Move, but move smart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Staying active is essential for knee health but it‚Äôs about choosing the right kind of movement. Dr. Nene recommends low-impact exercises such as cycling, swimming, and walking, which are gentle on the joints while still building strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSkip high-impact workouts like jump squats and intense runs,‚Äù he advised.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Vinay Kumaraswamy, Consultant ‚Äì Orthopaedics at Fortis Hospital, Rajaji Nagar, told The Indian Express that cycling is a great way to protect your knees.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúCycling is low-impact, which reduces wear and tear on joints. It also increases synovial fluid production, a natural lubricant essential for smooth joint movement,‚Äù Dr. Kumaraswamy explained.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Watch your weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Extra weight can put added pressure on the knees leading to faster wear and pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramneek Mahajan, Director ‚Äì Orthopaedics and Joint Replacement, Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Delhi told The Indian Express, ‚ÄúEven one extra kilogram of body weight can put up to four kilograms of pressure on your knees.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggests making small changes, like walking inside your home every hour and avoiding sitting for long periods. If knees are swollen, use ice or heat packs for relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKhdK4zRpyT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Strengthen the muscles that support your knees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Your knees don‚Äôt work alone, they rely on muscles like the quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves for support. Dr. Nene recommends including squats, leg lifts, and hamstring curls in your routine two to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGood posture and strong support muscles reduce pressure on the joints. Bad posture can worsen knee pain over time,‚Äù warned Dr. Mahajan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He also advises incorporating weight-loss exercises into your routine to further reduce knee stress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Wear the right shoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shoes play a bigger role in joint health than many people realize. Dr. Nene emphasizes choosing cushioned footwear with arch support and avoiding high heels, thin flats, or worn-out shoes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Poor footwear can change your posture and walking style, leading to misalignment and long-term knee damage. Make sure your shoes match your activity level and foot structure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Know the RICE method for injury relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In case of a knee injury or sudden pain, Dr. Nene recommends following the RICE method:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;R ‚Äì Rest&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I ‚Äì Ice&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;C ‚Äì Compression&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;E ‚Äì Elevation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple four-step approach helps reduce swelling, improve circulation, and speed up healing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Stretch every day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tight muscles can pull on your joints and create discomfort. Dr. Nene suggests doing just 5 minutes of stretching daily to reduce stiffness and prevent knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Try easy stretches like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standing quad stretch&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Calf stretch&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hamstring stretch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can improve flexibility and ease pressure on the knees over time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The knees are one of the most important joints in the body, bearing the weight of everything we do‚Äîfrom walking to running to standing. But most of us don‚Äôt start thinking about them until they start hurting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nene‚Äôs message is clear: Don‚Äôt wait for knee pain to take over your life. Small steps like stretching, wearing the right shoes, and maintaining a healthy weight can go a long way in protecting your joints and keeping you moving comfortably for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>financialexpress.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 11:48:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxOakFZQjRsTjV2RkpFZTQ4LUFpT3ppWTJQSk5HQU5XRWp6QTk0SWlKWnlSZEJvV2ZGSVlicldOY2kwTzluMEM1eWp1dkk2R0hIMkNnX2pwZEgxanVibFZjOFVPZFpiUFNVdlpZcEpKbGVsLXBPSExwWUxON0VpVmdVbFM3QkNOWndXUzVUVWNRai0wZ2VXN29ZNkJGSnlnY19Ha3RtRlNyMGhvSG90NEdfV0k2ZjhMVTlDazQ0bHI3TS1ySXMxeHc3ODF4WHQ3NlBiZWJiU2Z3Zw</guid></item><item><title>‰ΩøÁî®Â§ßÈ∫ªÊ≤ªÁñóÂÅ•Â∫∑ÈóÆÈ¢òÁöÑÁúüÁõ∏-„ÄäÂçéÁõõÈ°øÈÇÆÊä•„Äã | The truth about using cannabis for health problems - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPZDFkYzZOZ1hLYU1DcElWMDBuRU40RmRPNjNHVk8zOVhXaTd4OFNKUzNab1ZaSnR3UkxDM214OWpGdnVWQk51S0paQWQxSndIWnhEU2JMTjdBR29scmpiTEprRnpsZENZSGhEM1NXdWttQ1ZZaXYydVdzTjBTd0ZfeVZsOWd6c0pZSHpYbVZzRXdFb1Q4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PERUWHRIBNANRBX623DJ4NWT4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MTEALUXY5NCPDMXNEZK5JVOD4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many U.S. states have legalized cannabis, and there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults using it, says Jeffrey Quinlan, a family physician and professor of family medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O5BZIFEY2RCERJ6LRH4GQ6P4PA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In fact, 21 percent of people ages 50 and up have smoked, vaped or consumed cannabis (in what‚Äôs usually called an edible) in the past year, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/how-older-adults-use-think-about-and-discuss-cannabis" target="_blank"&gt;recent poll from the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. And 12 percent do so at least once a month. The reasons?

Of these, the evidence is strongest for treating chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H3PKPB3QJBG4HPEBNAK366BVXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There‚Äôs also substantial evidence that it may ease nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and may help control muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis, according to a &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24625/the-health-effects-of-cannabis-and-cannabinoids-the-current-state" target="_blank"&gt;2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. And some evidence suggests that cannabis may provide some short-term help for people who have &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/guide-to-getting-better-sleep-a8432032642/" target="_blank"&gt;trouble sleeping&lt;/a&gt; due to obstructive sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, chronic pain and MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J2MJKXAT6FHO5FVOGEFNL2ITCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But we still have much to learn about the right dosages, which vary from person to person and can change over time, as well as the efficacy of cannabis compared with other treatments, says Erin Bonar, a professor of psychiatry at Michigan Medicine of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. She‚Äôs one of the researchers associated with the poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q7IHTT6KSFDQXB3EZIA2NMSSHE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q7IHTT6KSFDQXB3EZIA2NMSSHE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Risks of cannabis use&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JCUKPI5S5VHW7LGTRRPM3UBMHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some doctors say that cannabis is a safer way to manage chronic pain than powerful, potentially addictive opioid drugs. But about 21 percent of regular users develop cannabis use disorder. This can increase the likelihood of risky behaviors like driving while high, and it can affect relationships and increase tolerance for cannabis, which causes some people to use it more and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EU75HVMFYBGNBCMGBI7KNCB2KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And higher doses can elevate heart rate and increase blood pressure, Quinlan says, which may raise heart attack and stroke risks, especially in people who already have heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VISJCZ256RDBFOF22KXUHEHI2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who use cannabis for mental health problems like anxiety also need to be wary, Bonar says. In some cases, it might improve the condition short-term, she says. But some people then feel worse when not using it, which can escalate anxiety over time. And recent research suggests that it‚Äôs associated with a greater likelihood of mental health and substance abuse problems, as well as accidents and injuries. High dosages can also cause paranoia and in rare cases can increase the risk of psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XJSQJ5XTPNHATLU5A2LEHY4PAU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XJSQJ5XTPNHATLU5A2LEHY4PAU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Before using cannabis&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PYNYKOFD4BC5FIZOXKCN5CH3WQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell your doctor.&lt;/b&gt; According to the Michigan poll, 44 percent of monthly cannabis users said they had not discussed it with their health care providers. Your doc can tell you if medications you may be taking ‚Äî such as blood thinners, statins, antihistamines, antidepressants and medications with sedative effects ‚Äî interact with cannabis. Your doctor may also be able to give you guidance on how to access medical cannabis ‚Äî though it won‚Äôt be covered by Medicare or other insurance because it‚Äôs still illegal on the federal level ‚Äî and help you monitor your use to see whether it‚Äôs helping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MJEMRPYVR5DULPTBTAY5OTKJCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid smoking and vaping.&lt;/b&gt; Using cannabis in these forms may cause health problems just like smoking or vaping tobacco, Quinlan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GQWXZTP2Q5FSZGUATZTESG4ON4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary of THC content labels.&lt;/b&gt; Most research indicates they‚Äôre not reliable. So if you‚Äôre going to use cannabis, opt for the lowest possible dosage (which may be an edible with 5 milligrams of THC or less), especially if you haven‚Äôt used the substance before, Quinlan says. Plus, it‚Äôs now easy to find cannabis products with a strength of 20 to 30 percent. The average potency in the 1990s was around 4 percent, Bonar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

There is research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://iogt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASCO-Alcohol-Cancer-Nov-2017.pdf"&gt;drinking could be dangerous&lt;/a&gt;, and research that indicates &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-016-0058-4"&gt;drinking is good for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Which is it? Obviously, too much drinking is bad for one‚Äôs health ‚Äî and drinking to excess can destroy the human body. But is moderate drinking good ‚Äî or, at least, fine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Dylan Scott, Vox‚Äôs senior health reporter, has been &lt;a href="/health/403684/alcohol-drinking-health-effects-science"&gt;looking into this matter for some time&lt;/a&gt;, and I recently asked him to sum up what he‚Äôs learned. Here‚Äôs what he had to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You‚Äôve done some reporting on alcohol recently and whether it‚Äôs safe. Is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is widespread agreement that heavy drinking is not good for you ‚Äî doctors and scientists have known for literally centuries that a lot of drinking is dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the more you drink, the greater your risk. Your risk starts to increase pretty exponentially once you‚Äôre having more than one or two drinks at a given sitting, especially if you‚Äôre drinking every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is still a lot of debate about the safety of drinking small amounts of alcohol and whether it can have very small health benefits. On that front, studies can seem to contradict themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I talked to one scientist who has published some research documenting cardiovascular benefits from drinking a little bit of alcohol, and I also recently talked to the author of a 2017 statement from the leading cancer physician medical society, which was basically intended to be a wake-up call to the public that &lt;a href="https://iogt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ASCO-Alcohol-Cancer-Nov-2017.pdf"&gt;alcohol is a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet those two people, despite appearing to be on opposite sides of the debate, would basically be in total agreement, about the negative consequences of more than one drink for a woman every day or more than two drinks for a man every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yes, but let me take a step back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What has stuck out to me in reporting about alcohol is that the problem isn‚Äôt so much the substance itself as it is widespread misunderstanding about what moderate drinking means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That‚Äôs 12 oz. of a 5 percent beer, 1.5-oz. glass of 80-proof liquor, and 5 oz. of a 12 percent glass of wine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There‚Äôs a trope among doctors that most people think they‚Äôre moderate drinkers but aren‚Äôt thinking about those numbers as they drink. I might pour a glass of wine and think I‚Äôm having one glass of wine, but a doctor would see two glasses of wine if it‚Äôs a really generous pour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Coming back to your question, if you didn‚Äôt know alcohol is a carcinogen, you‚Äôre not alone. I learned in my reporting that only 40 percent of people know alcohol is a carcinogen, which shows there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do in educating people about the health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Public health experts told me that they want to be more vocal about some of alcohol‚Äôs risks, especially about it being something that builds a dependency. Between that, and alcohol being a carcinogen, you can start to see why knowing what levels of drinking are actually moderate is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That‚Äôs interesting, and it makes me wonder about those headlines that claim a new study has found a glass of red wine a day is the key to longevity or something like that. Is there anything to those?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After my reporting, I do think there is some room for debate about whether a very modest amount of alcohol consumed in a very particular way might confer some small cardiovascular benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That said, even the doctor I talked to who‚Äôs authored studies finding some benefit, said, ‚ÄúThis is not an elixir&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù He was clear that his work shouldn‚Äôt be read as saying, ‚ÄúAlcohol is going to reduce your chance of diabetes, improve your heart health, or what have you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you‚Äôre saying I shouldn‚Äôt start drinking, hoping it will make me a healthier person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yes. The doctors I‚Äôve spoken to have said things like, ‚ÄúI would never tell somebody to start drinking because it‚Äôs not going to help you.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The basic thing to remember, though, is if you‚Äôre a light drinker, any potential problems caused by alcohol aren‚Äôt something worth worrying about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;People should be aware of the risks but shouldn‚Äôt panic about them. Really, my two big takeaways on alcohol are: Heavy drinking is dangerous, and it‚Äôs easy to drink too much. Those are the things to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNMGZ0aDNlQlY4eXJ4S3Y5YXN2VWZabFRsWVV0cWJ5MFBpUGJnOTBuTEd2V25vN210Zm9OclZEU2gxMC1KV1Z1WlNvVW5BNk5ramZsSko4STIxLXJkOUN3blZhblpiRVdsd2dXamEzRGdsSVVkcVlNQTZaOTlUMDIzdU9OTUJtZElX</guid></item></channel></rss>
