Tech moguls swear by it, Hollywood stars insist it keeps them trim. Britain's former prime minister &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68129595" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Rishi Sunak&lt;/a&gt; once spoke of starting his week with a 36-hour fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far the science has seemed supportive. Research suggests that extending the overnight fast may improve metabolism, aid cellular repair and perhaps even prolong life. Nutritionists, however, have long warned that skipping meals is no magic bullet - and may be risky for those with underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Intermittent fasting compresses eating into a short daily window, often eight hours, leaving a 16-hour gap without food. Other time-restricted diets, like the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/menus/intermittent_restricted_day_5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;5:2 plan&lt;/a&gt;, limit calories on certain days rather than hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402125000955" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;first large-scale study&lt;/a&gt; of its kind raises a more serious red flag. Researchers, analysing data from more than 19,000 adults, found that those who confined their eating to less than eight hours a day faced a 135% higher risk of dying from&lt;b id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cardiovascular disease - death due to heart and blood vessel diseases - than people who ate over 12-14 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An elevated cardiovascular risk means that, based on a person's health, lifestyle and medical data, they are more likely than others in the study to develop heart-related problems such as heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The link to overall mortality - deaths from any cause - was weaker and inconsistent, but the cardiovascular risk persisted across age, sex and lifestyle groups even after rigorous testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In other words, the study found only a weak and inconsistent link between time-restricted eating and overall deaths. But the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was sharply higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The authors stress that the study doesn't prove cause and effect. But the signal is striking enough to challenge the narrative of fasting as a risk-free path to better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers tracked American adults over eight years. To understand their eating habits, participants were asked on two separate days - about two weeks apart - to recall everything they ate and drank. From these "dietary recalls", scientists estimated each person's average eating window and treated it as representative of their long-term routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those who ate within an eight-hour window faced a 91% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease than those who spread meals over 12-14 hours, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They found the elevated cardiovascular risk was consistent across socioeconomic groups, and strongest among smokers and people with diabetes or existing heart disease - suggesting they should be especially cautious about long-term, narrow eating windows. The link held even after adjusting for diet quality, meal and snack frequency, and other lifestyle factors, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I asked the researchers how we should read the finding that heart-related deaths go up so dramatically, but overall deaths don't - is it biology, or bias in the data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Diet is a major driver of diabetes and heart disease, so an association with higher cardiovascular mortality is not unexpected, said Victor Wenze Zhong, the lead author of the peer-reviewed study in Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The unexpected finding is that sticking to a short eating window less than eight hours over years was linked to increased death risk from cardiovascular disease," says Prof Zhong, an epidemiologist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That runs counter to the popular belief - supported by short-term studies lasting only a few months to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M23-0052?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a year&lt;/a&gt; - that time-restricted eating improves heart and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In an accompanying editorial in the same journal, Anoop Misra, a leading endocrinologist, weighs the promise and pitfalls of intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the upside, he says, multiple trials and analyses suggest it can promote weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and enhance lipid profiles, with some evidence of anti-inflammatory benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It may also help people manage blood sugar without rigid calorie counting, fits easily with cultural or religious fasting practices, and is simple to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"However, the potential downsides include nutrient deficiencies, increased cholesterol, excessive hunger, irritability, headaches and reduced adherence over time," says Prof Misra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For people with diabetes, unmonitored fasting risks dangerous drops in blood sugar; and promotes junk food intake during eating window. For older adults or those with chronic conditions, prolonged fasting may worsen frailty or accelerate muscle loss." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is not the first time intermittent fasting has faced scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A rigorous &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2771095?guestAccessKey=444bbcb2-7e13-4dc6-998f-5de5e27aa19e&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=092820" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;three-month study &lt;/a&gt;published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2020 found that participants lost only a small amount of weight, much of which may have come from muscle. Another &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784658?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; indicated that intermittent fasting may produce side effects such as weakness, hunger, dehydration, headaches and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The new study, Prof Misra says, now adds a more troubling caveat - a possible link to higher cardiovascular risk, at least in certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I asked Prof Zhong what he would advise clinicians and the public to take away from  the latest findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said people with heart disease or diabetes should be cautious about adopting an eight-hour eating window. The findings point to the need for "personalised" dietary advice, grounded in health status and evolving evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Based on the evidence as of now, focusing on what people eat appears to be more important than focusing on the time when they eat. At least, people may consider not to adopt eight-hour eating window for a long time either for the purpose of preventing cardiovascular disease or for improving longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clearly, for now, the message is less about abandoning fasting altogether and more about tailoring it to an individual's risk profile. Until the evidence is clearer, the safest bet may be to focus less on the clock and more on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 01:22:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8tdzc3Z3N2ZXZ4LVlEMVk1SVJIVWtacl9oOVNJQjQtNjMwR1VJRGJ0dVV3cTFGQXJCWW4zUHdxdmNWTUJiZ09teGtua0QyNXVydnhKTWd5MFpfUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5xSzBqN2ZMaERWZmpYUElsTzA4OWtFa0NJYXNTRDBJUXBuWUlKaU81SFh0YVJmTWlQeU9FbDBBY21KOU5IaUdJQVBUTU5jSkxTTVpNUXdtUHJ5TlBYMDRV</guid></item><item><title>妈妈在迪士尼乐园的跟踪设备犯下严重错误后，幼儿住院-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15048207/Toddler-hospitalized-mom-mistake-tracking-device-Disneyland.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A four-year-old girl was rushed to the hospital after swallowing a button battery from a broken electronic tracking device, a device her mother had purchased initially to keep her family safe during a trip to Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Marie realized while on the trip with her four children that the $29 Oreo-sized trackers did not work, so she stowed them in her car’s glove compartment with a plan to bring them to a store for repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trip ended, and the family returned home to Vancouver Island, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-f1339670-8516-11f0-b39a-67e43652d847"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the dysfunctional trackers forgotten in the glove box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until one day, Lisa heard a gulping sound come from the backseat. Her four-year-old daughter Lily had reached the device and swallowed what she told her parents was a quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But an X-ray at the hospital that day revealed she had actually swallowed a small button battery taken from within one of the tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marie said: ‘As a mom, when we figured out it was a button battery, I was like, okay, her whole insides are burned out. I was on the bathroom floor of the hospital crying.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Swallowing a button battery is a serious &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-11973227/Mother-issues-warning-parents-daughter-swallowed-battery-toy-wand.html"&gt;medical emergency&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside the body, the moist environment of the esophagus or throat completes an electrical circuit between the battery's positive and negative terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A chemical reaction occurs when the circuit is completed, generating sodium hydroxide, a powerful, industrial-strength &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14027025/terrified-mom-toddler-toy-battery-swallow-throat-hospital.html"&gt;chemical that burns&lt;/a&gt; and liquefies the surrounding flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemical, which is also used to unclog drains, can burn a hole through the esophagus within a couple of hours. If it reaches the digestive tract, it can become lodged there, where it can start to burn through the intestinal wall, potentially leading to a hole, infection, and severe internal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Four-year-old Lily, pictured in her hospital bed, swallowed the button battery inside a tracking device. She narrowly avoided a deadly chemical burn in her esophagus &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small round trackers Marie purchased are popular devices used to track the location of electronics, but are commonly used now to track everything from luggage to pets and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Disneyland is scary so I bought them to track my kids,’ Marie said. ‘The things that I thought would keep my kids safe are actually what caused harm.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A generally cautious parent, Marie has always been careful with batteries around her children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she had repeatedly warned them of the dangers of button batteries over the years, with the latest warning issued just two weeks prior to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She never believed her children would go into the glove box and take the small metal tags, let alone open them up and swallow their contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The button battery that Lily swallowed did not stay in her esophagus, sparing her from a deadly chemical burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the X-ray revealed that it had reached her bowel, still a dangerous position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors chose not to operate on the little girl to remove the battery, which would have involved a major invasive procedure with significant risks of its own, including infection and anesthesia complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The button battery that Lily swallowed is pictured. Her mother had stored the tracking devices in her car's glove compartment when she realized while on a trip to Disneyland that the devices did not work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The button battery reached Lily's digestive system. Typically, once inside the esophagus, moisture completes an electrical circuit between the battery’s terminals, triggering a reaction that produces a potent chemical that rapidly burns and dissolves surrounding tissue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they sent the family home with laxatives to allow Lily to pass the battery naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was giving her laxatives and all kinds of things to try and get this thing out of her,’ Marie said. ‘I had her on trampolines, on a vibration plate, eating prunes, everything.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anxiety took a toll on her family. Lily’s siblings asked if their sister was going to die, while Marie exhausted all options to help speed her digestion along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After four days, Lily passed the battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marie said: ‘I wouldn't want that to happen to anybody else. It was very scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you have any toys that have button batteries in them, then throw them out, get rid of them.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, nearly two-year-old Johnathan Huff suddenly fell ill at daycare. He became lethargic and had a bloody nose. When he vomited, there was blood there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believed Johnathan was suffering from a viral illness that caused fever and vomiting. A few days after getting sick, Johnathan had a fatal seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lily was allowed to leave the hospital to pass the battery naturally. Her mother fed her laxatives to speed the process along, but it took four days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lily, second from right in front of her father, is pictured with her family. After the terrifying ordeal, her mother disposed of her toys that used the same type of batteries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A routine autopsy revealed that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-9184391/Toddler-bleeds-death-swallowing-button-battery-burned-organs-North-Carolina.html"&gt;a small button battery&lt;/a&gt; was lodged in Johnathan's intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The official cause of his death was a massive hemorrhage, caused by the battery's corrosive chemicals burning through his esophageal and aortic walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His mother, Jackie, said: 'It immediately felt like it was something we had done, we were desperately trying to figure out where this battery had come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't a long search.

Such water systems include shower heads, sink faucets, hot tubs, decorative fountains, large plumbing systems and cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following an investigation, health officials were able to trace the bacteria back to cooling towers atop the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site overseen by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common way for someone to get sick is by breathing in mist containing legionella. Another way that the disease can be contracted is if someone accidentally swallows contaminated water and it enters their lungs, also known as aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most healthy people who are exposed to the bacteria do not get sick. Those who are more susceptible to contracting the disease include current or former smokers and people 50 years or older, as well as those with specific health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms usually develop two to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria and include cough, fever, headaches and muscle aches as well as shortness of breath. Other symptoms include confusion, diarrhea or nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following the outbreak, all facilities with legionella-positive test results completed full cleaning and disinfection as directed by city officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Michelle Morse, New York City’s acting health commissioner, said: “As the city’s doctor, my thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the spread of legionella, and our hearts are with the families who lost a loved one … We are working with building owners on next steps to protect the health and safety of Harlem residents and to prevent future clusters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following the outbreak, the Adams administration issued a slew of new proposals that include expanding the health department’s capacity to inspect the city’s cooling towers, requiring building owners to test for legionella at least every 30 days during the cooling tower operating period instead of the current 90-day requirement, expanding the health department’s sampling capacity to conduct proactive sampling of building cooling tower systems, and maintaining contracts to surge capacity when faced with novel issues during future clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNYy1wd01MYTdFVzFQeFNvOVhzbkFrb0sxZV9NOWVMdE1TaFJab1Q0c3ZBcnBST0F4bGY3NE04elVmUG54TEx6cXhHQzdWS0xIY3hZQ2MzR0pILXdzMVRMVTBZZXE2UE9pWHVzT3dhSzZJWkNRQWRrNFM2dENmQjRwdTdFNlB1THhHdjhuckl6Q3h6VHpGRFlwcGlQQzZBLS1wUlgwMEl3</guid></item><item><title>这个12分钟的早晨习惯在40分钟后在健身房锻炼超过45分钟的力量-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/12-minute-morning-strength-routine-after-40/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Once you hit 40, building and maintaining strength becomes more critical than ever. Muscle mass naturally declines with age (a process called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560813/" target="_blank"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;), which can start as early as your 30s and accelerate with each passing decade. Having less muscle as you age can also negatively impact your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7090295/" target="_blank"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571089/" target="_blank"&gt;joint health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2024.1453527/full" target="_blank"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156816372100091X" target="_blank"&gt;your ability to perform daily tasks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is &lt;i&gt;ETNT &lt;/i&gt;has you covered. We chatted with Stephen Sheehan, CPT, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://barbend.com/author/stephen-sheehan/" target="_blank"&gt;BarBend&lt;/a&gt;, who shares his go-to time-efficient morning routine for building strength without needing to go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“This sequence hits all the major muscle groups and builds functional strength quickly without any equipment,” Sheehan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2021/06000/resistance_training_load_effects_on_muscle.12.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has shown that even brief bouts of resistance exercise can boost muscle function and support long-term health. While hitting the gym for a long strength session is great if you have the time, you don’t need to commit to 45-minute workouts to see results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following circuit involves five exercises, each performed for 45 seconds with a 15-second rest in between. Complete two full rounds for a total of 12 minutes. All you need is a clear space with grippy flooring and your body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the workout and detailed instructions, then be sure to check out these &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-core-strength-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;5 Bodyweight Moves That Build Core Strength Better Than Gym Classes After 45&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12-Minute Morning Routine Builds Strength After 40&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l83R5PblSMA?si=mosMBHwJcQMcB7Bz" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-squats-to-see-results-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;Squats&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most functional exercises you can do, as they &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10987311/" target="_blank"&gt;mimic common daily movements&lt;/a&gt; like sitting and standing, while training your lower body to work as a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheehan tells us. “Squats activate your largest muscle groups like your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, which improve strength and circulation first thing in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly pointed out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your chest lifted and core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower your body as if sitting into a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor (or as low as comfortable. If you feel any pain, stop immediately!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to return to a standing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Focus on control and form and avoid letting your knees collapse inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/balance-tests-fall-risk-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;4 Tests That Reveal If You’re Headed for a Dangerous Fall After 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASdvN_XEl_c?si=d9JCKbD37RI6fEQx" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love them or hate them, you can’t deny that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/push-ups-elite-upper-body-strength-trainers/" target="_blank"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt; are a staple for building upper-body strength. They engage your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core, making them one of the most efficient bodyweight exercises you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get into a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modification:&lt;/b&gt; If a regular push-up is too difficult, drop to your knees while keeping your body in a straight line from head to knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-exercises-women-over-45-daily/" target="_blank"&gt;7 Morning Exercises Women Should Do Every Day to Stay Young After 45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Planks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvIjsG5Svck?si=oImnyI-hZY2slkuj" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-variations-for-six-pack/" target="_blank"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8964357/" target="_blank"&gt;isometric exercise&lt;/a&gt; that strengthens not just the abs but the entire core, including the back, hips, and shoulders. “A plank locks in deep core strength and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8964357/" target="_blank"&gt;supports better posture and spine alignment&lt;/a&gt;,” Sheehan explains. “Focus on a straight line from head to heels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get into a forearm plank position with your elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core, glutes, and legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid letting your hips sag or pike upward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Focus on breathing steadily by inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-stop-muscle-loss-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;6 Best Standing Exercises To Stop Muscle Loss After 40 in 30 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glute Bridges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUgsJ8-Vi0E?si=qI1xYqISD0rdtff1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glute bridges are fantastic for strengthening your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039033/" target="_blank"&gt;posterior chain&lt;/a&gt; (backside), including your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, which often gets neglected in favor of front-of-body training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Squeeze at the top to get the most muscle activation and lower with control,” Sheehan advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat, hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to lift your hips toward the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes at the top and hold for one to two seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your hips back down with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your core engaged to avoid overextending your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alternating Lunges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTej-ax9XiA?si=ynJy9TEfaNmEXnh4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes lunges so effective is that you are forced to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6063068/" target="_blank"&gt;engage each leg individually&lt;/a&gt;, which can help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6006536/" target="_blank"&gt;correct imbalances&lt;/a&gt; and build strength in the quads, glutes, and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lunges improve balance, coordination, and lower-body strength,” Sheehan says. “Keep your front knee over your ankle and drive through your heel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step forward with your right leg and lower until both knees are bent at about 90 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your right heel to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the left leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward.&lt;/p&gt;

The diet tweaks that helped you lose a pound or two in a pinch or the workout that turbocharged your energy just don't deliver in the same way. While frustrating, this isn't unusual. After 40, metabolism starts to slow, muscle mass begins to decline, and hormone levels start to shift, all changes that need to be accounted for in your habits. The first step you can take: Incorporating more foods for women over 40 into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://kitchencoachrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of Kitchen Coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to following a regular exercise routine, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a30981827/how-to-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and reducing your stress levels, eating foods that are rich in antioxidants, protein, and healthy fats can help you curb hunger and cravings while counteracting these changes&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what foods should go on your plate? &lt;a href="https://kitchencoachrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of Kitchen Coach, shared her favorite nutritional all-stars that can help increase your fat-burning capabilities, stabilize your energy, and minimize your disease risk. From dark chocolate to salmon to vibrant berries, these foods for women over 40 are full of flavor &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; age-reversing nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods for women over 40&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Flaxseeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flaxseeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fats for a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g32905337/brain-healthy-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sharp mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sharp mind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20502183/best-foods-for-heart-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy heart&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, they’re great for your gut. “As we age, it’s more important to eat the right foods to keep your gut health in check,” said Mirkin. “Flaxseeds are loaded with fiber for long-term digestive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just be sure to use ground flaxseeds or grind whole ones; your body digests and absorbs the nutrients from ground flaxseeds better than whole ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Toss some over yogurt or oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Wild salmon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish, like salmon, are rich in omega-3s and a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g23065278/high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good source of lean protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good source of lean protein&lt;/a&gt;. And while fat has more than double the calories of protein and carbohydrates, it is key to keeping your cravings in check. “Salmon is not only satisfying and delicious, but it will also make your skin glow, reduce your risk of disease, and even curb your hunger,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/recipes/a26986386/salmon-avocado-tomato-salad-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Salmon Salad with Avocado and Sweet Grape Tomatoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Salmon Salad with Avocado and Sweet Grape Tomatoes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Avocados&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with healthy fats, avocados can help keep your skin plump, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g29538761/best-food-for-hair-growth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nourish your hair;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nourish your hair&lt;/a&gt;, and help &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g26576559/foods-for-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their decent &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; content. “Although avocados are very high in fat, they are linked with weight loss because they are so satisfying,” said Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Nuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts make a filling &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/g19576831/healthy-snack-ideas-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:snack that promotes weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;snack that promotes weight loss&lt;/a&gt; because they’re high in fiber, healthy fats, and protein. Bonus: The nutrients in nuts help reduce your risk of chronic conditions, like &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease, said Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; These &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/recipes/a22998801/cherry-chocolate-granola-bars-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cherry chocolate granola bars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cherry chocolate granola bars&lt;/a&gt; pack a double dose of nuts with almond butter and chopped almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Watercress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shake up your go-to salad with this peppery leafy green while keeping your skin glowing in the process. “It’s packed with water, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20511745/9-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g21288692/vitamin-a-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, and antioxidants that kill free radicals,” Mirkin said, one of the main aggressors of premature skin damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Replace some of the lettuce in your favorite salad with watercress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Sauerkraut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made from fermented cabbage, this tangy condiment is packed with gut-boosting probiotics—a.k.a. good bacteria—making it a nutritional must-have for women over 40. Research shows that these that healthy bugs may improve your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9818925/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/probiotics-may-help-boost-mood-and-cognitive-function" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, and even your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10385652/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;. Not a fan of sauerkraut? Kimchi, the spicy Korean version, will deliver the same perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a spoonful to a burger or sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Dark chocolate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to better nutrition after 40, but this after-dinner indulgence can actually do wonders for your health. “Dark chocolate is rich in flavonols, which protect your heart, reduce the risk of diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g26576559/foods-for-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, ” Mirkin said. Stick to chocolate bars that contain at least 70% cocoa and less than 6 grams of added sugar to get the most nutritional bang out of every serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25728973/healthy-chocolate-bars-snacks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13 Healthy Dark Chocolate Bars That Aren’t Sugar Bombs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13 Healthy Dark Chocolate Bars That Aren’t Sugar Bombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Dark leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dark leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and mustard greens, contain high amounts of vitamin K, lutein, folate, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64624906/best-calcium-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calcium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, and beta carotene, which can preserve memory functioning,” said Mirkin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a handful of greens to a smoothie for a nutrition boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries will naturally brighten your dish and supply hunger-curbing fiber to satisfy sweet cravings. Their gem-like hues are a great indicator of their nutrient concentration. “Dark pigmentation and rich color means the berries are high in disease-fighting antioxidants and phytochemicals,” Mirkin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Sprinkle over yogurt or snack on by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlic is a serious wellness wonder, especially for women over 40. “Studies suggest that garlic can minimize bone loss by increasing estrogen levels. It is also nutrient-rich with very few calories and adds flavor to foods so you’re satisfied with less,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Use it to flavor roasted vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Edamame&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edamame packs 9 grams of muscle-building &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a20514733/high-protein-vegetables-and-plant-based-food/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt; in just ½ cup for less than 100 calories. These versatile soybeans are also a great source of folate (vitamin B9), &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g20465791/8-foods-that-have-more-iron-than-beef/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins C and A, and potassium for your heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Roast some with flaky sea salt or perk up your favorite pasta dish with a handful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Greek yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g31350918/bone-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keep your bones strong;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keep your bones strong&lt;/a&gt; with a serving of rich and creamy Greek yogurt every day. “It’s an excellent source of calcium and contains almost no sodium,” Mirkin said. Greek yogurt packs more protein and has a thicker consistency than other yogurts, so it’s the perfect snack for keeping you full and energized. Plus, it has active cultures that support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy a bowl of Greek yogurt for breakfast with honey, granola, and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Extra virgin olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything more delicious than EVOO drizzled over warm, crusty bread? A staple of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, olive oil is rich in unsaturated fats that have anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/olive-oil-can-it-lower-your-risk-of-dying-early-202203012695" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:promote longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;promote longevity&lt;/a&gt; and optimal heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a healthy dose of olive oil in your homemade salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14. Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any way you scramble it, eggs are a nutritional multitasker. They contain vitamin D for bone health, choline for brain function, and protein for preserving muscle. Mirkin suggested scrambling one egg with three egg whites for a slimming and filling breakfast. “The high fat and protein content (plus lack of carbohydrates and sugars) in eggs makes them an excellent choice for women over 40,” said Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Need meal prep ideas? Try some make-ahead egg muffins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;15. Chia seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds may be tiny, but they’re mighty with filling fiber, omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium for healthy bones, and complete plant-based protein. Because they absorb water so well, downing chia is also thought to help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11406937/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:boost your satiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;boost your satiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make a chia seed pudding or add some to a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;16. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their translucent appearance, onions are dense in vital nutrients. “They are high in the protective antioxidant &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20511745/9-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins for a healthy metabolism, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; for stable blood pressure levels,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Prep some caramelized onions in advance to add to sandwiches, stir-fries, salads, and soups for a burst of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;17. Carrots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots are packed with beta carotene (the pigment responsible for their vibrant hue), which is converted into vitamin A—a superstar nutrient that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a31286522/how-to-boost-immune-system/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supports immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;supports immunity&lt;/a&gt; and boosts eye health. “In your 40s, it’s more important than ever to eat more &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g21288692/vitamin-a-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A-rich foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, because they also protect your eyes from cataracts,” said Mirkin. Carrots are also high in potassium to stabilize blood pressure, fiber for better digestion, and vitamin K for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Snack on them raw with some hummus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;18. Broccoli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is chock-full of antioxidants, phytonutrients, and vitamins C, B6, and A—all of which Mirkin said can help stave off chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s as you age. Plus, you’ll get tons of healthy fiber for better digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Roast with garlic and olive oil for a powerhouse side dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;19. Chicken&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason chicken has become a weight loss staple: It packs roughly 25 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g23065278/high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; in just 4 ounces (or about the size of your palm). It’s also fairly low in fat and calories, making it a leaner choice than most red meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Marinate and grill for a tasty supper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;20. Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, all bell peppers contain more vitamin C than an orange, an antioxidant that’s thought to boost immunity and promote collagen production. Any color will do, but red is the sweetest if you prefer your crunchy snack to be less bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Add raw to a salad or saute to put in tacos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;21. Beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/agriculture/extension/publications/all-about-beans-nutrition-health-benefits-preparation-and-use-menus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Beans&lt;/a&gt; are loaded with fiber to keep your blood sugar stable, along with folate and iron. Get even more out of this vegetarian protein source by choosing darker varieties (like kidney or black beans), which have higher concentrations of antioxidants and phytonutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make healthy black bean burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;22. Quinoa&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa is a complete plant protein—and serves up a whopping &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=20035-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 grams per 1-cup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 grams per 1-cup&lt;/a&gt; serving! The fluffy grain also offers tons of gut-healthy fiber to keep you feeling satisfied. Bonus: It cooks up faster than brown rice and barley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Use as a base for a veggie-packed grain bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;23. Basil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basil is loaded with polyphenols, which are beneficial in soothing chronic pain associated with arthritis, and even help protect your liver, brain, and heart, according to Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Perk up your salad or pasta dish with a sprinkle of minced basil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;24. Ginger root&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one teaspoon of ginger per week can improve your artery function, said Mirkin. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/ginger-benefits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies also show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Studies also show&lt;/a&gt; the fragrant root (often when taken in supplement form) may also help prevent diabetes, ease menstrual and muscle pain, and possibly even ward off obesity. If you’re prone to tummy troubles, it’s also a great natural remedy for nausea and other digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traditional-Medicinals-Organic-Ginger-Herbal/dp/B0009F3S7I/?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65935574%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Herbal Tea;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Herbal Tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;25. Sweet potatoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bright orange tubers fall under the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25335049/healthy-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy carb category;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy carb category&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because sweet potatoes pack tons of gut-filling fiber, magnesium, heart-healthy potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Eat them roasted, baked, or boiled in salads, as fries, or in soups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;26. Tomatoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are nutritional superstars. Red tomatoes, in particular, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11179732/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in lycopene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in lycopene&lt;/a&gt;, a carotenoid that may help reduce your risk of chronic diseases. The tangy fruits are also low in calories but high in potassium, zinc, and vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Juicy tomatoes are amazing in salsas, sauces, salads, and sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;27. Mushrooms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good-for-you nutrients in mushrooms, including vitamin D, B vitamins, potassium, selenium, and the powerful antioxidants ergothioneine and glutathione, have been shown to improve heart health, brain health, gut health, and immune function, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/five-health-benefits-of-mushrooms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cedars-Sinai;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cedars-Sinai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Toss into a stir-fry or savory soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;28. Oregano&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This powerful green herb is “rich in antioxidants that fight free radical damage,” said Mirkin, potentially helping to stave off disease-causing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Sprinkle this subtly sweet Italian staple on everything from salads to pastas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;29. Citrus fruits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, and the like boast tons of antioxidants, fiber, vitamin C, and other nutrients that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10451236/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows can;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows can&lt;/a&gt; boost your brain health, aid weight loss, protect your heart, and keep your skin looking radiant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Squeeze over cooked protein for a tangy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;30. Nutritional yeast&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vegan staple packs a powerful combination of nutrients. “Just 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast offers a whopping 8 grams of protein to keep you satisfied with minimal calories,” said Mirkin. It’s also a great source of B vitamins—something that many vegetarians tend to be deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;With a cheesy, nutty flavor, nutritional yeast makes a great dairy-free substitute for cheese in pasta, pizza, and salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you age, your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a20478794/boost-metabolism-with-the-high-metabolism-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; slows down, you begin to lose muscle mass, and your hormone levels go a bit wonky, making you more prone to weight gain, mood changes, and health problems you may not have dealt with during your younger years. Fortunately, there are things you can do to increase your fat-burning capabilities, stabilize your energy, and minimize your disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to following a regular exercise routine, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a30981827/how-to-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/g26542035/how-to-relieve-stress/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing your stress levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reducing your stress levels&lt;/a&gt;, eating antioxidant-rich foods can help you curb hunger and cravings while improving your overall health&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;So what foods should go on your plate?

The study analyzed both dietary habits and brain autopsy results, offering evidence that nutrition may help protect memory-related brain regions during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet stands for Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It combines elements of the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fish, and olive oil, with the DASH diet, which is designed to reduce high blood pressure through reduced sodium intake and balanced nutrients. The MIND diet specifically highlights foods thought to benefit brain function, such as leafy greens, berries, nuts, whole grains, beans, poultry, and fish. It also limits foods high in saturated fat and sugar, including red meat, full-fat cheese, pastries, and fried or fast foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked the MIND diet to slower cognitive decline, reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and greater brain volume. However, its potential relationship with specific brain pathologies had not been fully explored. The new study aimed to address that gap by focusing on hippocampal sclerosis—a degenerative condition that affects the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have limited treatments for dementia, and the growing aging population faces an increased risk of this condition, which affects quality of life in many ways. Previously, we have shown that the MIND diet is associated with slower cognitive decline, reduced dementia risk, less brain pathology, and greater cognitive resilience. Thus, this study was to further understand the other potential underlying mechanisms beyond Alzheimer’s pathology that can explain link between diet and cognition,” said study author Puja Agarwal, an assistant professor at Rush University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hippocampal health is important for older adults, particularly for memory. Hippocampal sclerosis is an important pathologic marker for hippocampal health, characterized by gliosis and neuronal loss and related to cognitive impairment and dementia beyond Alzheimer’s pathology. However, there are limited human studies on diet and hippocampal health. This study specifically looked at the MIND diet to examine its association with hippocampal sclerosis and whether that association helps explain the link between diet and cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from the Memory and Aging Project, a long-running study conducted by Rush University in Chicago. Participants were older adults who did not have dementia at enrollment and who agreed to donate their brains for research after death. Over the course of several years, participants completed annual evaluations, including cognitive tests, physical exams, and dietary assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the dietary component, participants filled out detailed food frequency questionnaires that asked about their usual intake of a wide range of foods. The researchers used these data to calculate MIND diet scores for each person, with higher scores indicating closer adherence to the diet. These scores were based on 15 components: ten considered healthy for the brain and five considered less healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of death, researchers conducted brain autopsies following standardized procedures. They examined the hippocampus for signs of sclerosis, measured the extent of neuronal loss, and assessed whether there was evidence of LATE pathology. The team also recorded other relevant factors, including whether the person had Alzheimer’s pathology, vascular disease, or a genetic risk factor (the APOE-ε4 allele).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of 809 participants, about 10 percent showed signs of hippocampal sclerosis. Those with higher MIND diet scores were less likely to have this condition, even after adjusting for age, sex, education, calorie intake, Alzheimer’s disease markers, and vascular conditions. Each additional point on the MIND diet scale was associated with a 22 percent reduction in the odds of having hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results were encouraging on how a modifiable risk factor such as diet may impact one’s hippocampal health via reducing the likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis,” Agarwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at cases where hippocampal sclerosis appeared alongside LATE pathology. Again, people who adhered more closely to the MIND diet had lower odds of having both conditions. However, the diet did not appear to have a significant association with LATE pathology by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a subset of 300 participants, the team analyzed the degree of neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Those in the highest MIND diet group had fewer signs of severe neuronal loss. Even after accounting for potential confounding factors, such as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular issues, this association remained significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding came from a mediation analysis. The researchers wanted to understand whether the link between the MIND diet and reduced dementia risk might be explained by its effect on hippocampal sclerosis. Their analysis indicated that about 21 percent of the diet’s protective effect against dementia could be attributed to its association with lower rates of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the existing literature on MIND diet and brain health outcomes including cognitive decline and dementia and extends our understanding on how diet may play a role via supporting hippocampal health by its association with less hippocampal sclerosis and more neurons in the hippocampus,” Agarwal told PsyPost. “To our knowledge these are the first findings in human studies to report that the association of diet and dementia is partially mediated by hippocampal sclerosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers ran additional tests to check the strength of their results. They excluded participants who had moderate to severe cognitive impairment early on, as well as those whose dietary data were collected close to death. Even after these adjustments, the association between the MIND diet and hippocampal health remained consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given dementia is a known concern for aging population, these findings are encouraging and can have major public health implications such as to promote a good healthy diet for brain health,” Agarwal said. “It also implies that talking about a healthy diet such as MIND diet should be prioritized in the clinical settings by trained individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study presents strong evidence of a link between the MIND diet and markers of brain health, it also has some limitations. Because it is an observational study, it cannot confirm a cause-and-effect relationship. It is possible that other unmeasured factors—such as access to healthcare, broader lifestyle habits, or genetic differences—could have influenced both diet and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in the study were primarily older White adults who agreed to donate their brains for research, which may limit how broadly the findings can be applied. The researchers noted that more work is needed to see whether these associations hold in more diverse populations or in younger age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area for future research involves identifying the specific nutrients or foods that may be most beneficial. While the MIND diet includes a variety of recommended foods, it is not yet clear which components contribute most strongly to the observed effects. Ongoing research is also examining how diet interacts with biological markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The role of modifiable lifestyle factors, including diet, is gaining momentum as a preventive strategy for dementia worldwide,” Agarwal said. “Thus, studies like ours are important and open doors for more research in this space. To further extend our findings, we are now looking into specific foods, nutrients, and biomarkers indicating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress—the two known hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease–related dementias (AD/ADRD)—using upcoming platforms so that we can develop precise dietary recommendations and generate more clinical implications for at-risk populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837334" target="_blank"&gt;MIND Diet and Hippocampal Sclerosis Among Community-Based Older Adults&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Puja Agarwal, Sonal Agrawal, Maude Wagner, Laurel J.

It's also what you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to do. We pick up habits because they make us feel happy, productive, or socially accepted, but they can also sometimes work against us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not realize it, but certain habits can actually slow your thinking and cloud your judgment. The smartest people recognize this and know how to unlearn pesky habits that hold them back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 8 things smart people stop doing once they realize they're making themselves less intelligent:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Eating a lot of sugar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/sugar-consumption-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="eating sugar things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="eating sugar things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages.com Yuri A | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consume sugar, our blood glucose level rises. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because glucose is an essential fuel for our brains. It actually utilizes one-half of the energy produced from the sugar that we store in our bodies. However, the problem starts when we introduce &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; glucose into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10780393/#sec5-nutrients-16-00075" rel="nofollow"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked chronically high blood sugar to cognitive impairment. Excess glucose in the blood decreases the production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a crucial chemical for the brain to process new memories and recall information. As a result, a high-sugar diet restricts the brain’s capability to learn and form memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/odd-traits-highly-intelligent-people-others-find-slightly-unsettling"&gt;11 Odd Traits Of Highly Intelligent People That Others Find Slightly Unsettling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Having too much screen time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern technology and the pandemic have made screen time unavoidable over the past couple of years. Though some people prefer working remotely, it can have some negative effects on our social and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face-to-face meetings are really valuable for our mental health. People are spending way more time on screens than ever, and missing out on the valuable cognitive activity that happens when interacting in person. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34957-4#Sec2" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Austrian scientists examined how mental health was affected by the conditions of the pandemic. They found that "people who generally spent more time on face-to-face and digital text communication during the lockdown had better mental health than people who generally spent less time on face-to-face and digital text communication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at screens all day long can significantly interrupt your quality of sleep, and it has even been proven to increase depression and anxiety. To avoid damaging your brain in the long run, set a clear limit for your screen time. &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/reduce-screen-time/index.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Health experts&lt;/a&gt; suggest that, outside of work, screen time for adults shouldn't exceed two hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Not getting enough sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/sleep-deprivation-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="not sleeping things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="not sleeping things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;New Africa | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that our central nervous system is our body’s main information highway. Sleep is vital for your body to function perfectly, but severe insomnia can cause disruptions in how your body transmits and processes information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathways are established between nerve cells (neurons) in your brain during sleep that help you recall new knowledge. Sleep deprivation drains your brain, making it unable to perform its functions effectively. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; has some great tips on how to sleep better at night, including having a consistent sleeping schedule, getting physical activity every day, and creating an optimal environment for resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sleep deprivation can make you more susceptible to micro-sleep, which is when people fall asleep for a short period of up to 30 seconds. Out-of-control microsleep can be fatal, especially when you are in the driver's seat. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-you-should-know-about-microsleep" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sleep expert Dr. Samuel Gurevich&lt;/a&gt; said, "It’s important to recognize it’s happening and the situations that cause it and to take it seriously. Sleepiness causes a significant number of car and industrial accidents. Microsleep can have big impacts on you and those around you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/reasons-secretly-brilliant-people-usually-struggle-fall-asleep"&gt;11 Reasons Secretly Brilliant People Usually Struggle To Fall Asleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Overeating&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overeating and eating unhealthy foods are believed to be bad habits that lead to long-term consequences for the brain. &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/mireille-serlie/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Mireille Serlie&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine, found in her &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00816-9" rel="nofollow"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; that people who are obese have an impaired brain response that struggles to detect nutrients in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explained, "In neuroimaging studies in humans, we found differences in brain areas involved in food intake between people with a healthy weight and those with obesity. We don’t know exactly when these changes in the brain occur and when they become more permanent. But we do know that specific eating patterns and diet compositions are associated with weight gain, suggesting specific nutrients play a role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overeating has a physical impact on your body and puts you at risk for major health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, all of which are known to also be linked to brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/multitasking-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="multitasking things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="multitasking things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Inside Creative House | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who multitask are persistently distracted, and they aren’t nearly as focused as those who use their brains to work on one task at a time. Multitaskers have a harder time filtering out extraneous information since they are using all parts of the brain at once, and they often take longer to complete tasks than those who just work on one task at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106698#s3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that multitaskers have reduced density in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which plays a key role in attention, decision-making, error detection, and emotion regulation. Other &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0903620106" rel="nofollow"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found that "heavy multitaskers were slower in detecting changes in visual patterns, more susceptible to false recollections of the distractors during a memory task, and were slower in task switching." If you want to work most efficiently and effectively, science says that multitasking isn't the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Subjecting themselves to loud noises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your ears are delicate organs, and the noises you hear daily, like traffic and construction, not only affect your hearing but also your cognitive function. A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.12191" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of over 5,000 Chicago residents revealed that, for every 10 decibel (dB) increase in residential noise level, there was a 36% increase in the risk of mild cognitive impairment and a 29% increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. If you live in a big city, you may want to invest in some ear protection for the sake of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ear infections can also create difficulties for hearing and neurological complications in the long run. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-018-0817-7" rel="nofollow"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that hearing loss, facial paralysis, meningitis, and brain abscesses can be unfortunate side effects of ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Not getting daily movement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/daily-movement-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="not moving things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="not moving things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Drazen Zigic | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we struggle with finding the motivation to go to the gym or stick to our health goals. However, we might be a little more motivated knowing that exercise is crucial to maintaining brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Booth and Nathan Kerr, researchers at the University of Missouri, discovered in a &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/inactive-today-forgetful-tomorrow-mizzou-researchers-discover-a-link-between-lack-of-physical-activity-and-a-decline-in-brain-health/" rel="nofollow"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that only 10 days of being physically inactive can lead to insulin resistance and an increase in reactive oxygen species production in the hippocampus, which is a brain region involved in memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle disuse has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Booth said, "Research in Alzheimer’s development is starting to show that a lot of the neurological changes for Alzheimer’s disease are occurring when people are in their 40s and 50s, even if the official diagnosis of Alzheimer’s often comes at or after age 65. So, if you can develop good habits in terms of exercise and lifestyle earlier in your life, your brain will thank you later on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Consuming constant information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called "information overload," and our brains simply can't keep up. The rising popularity of short-form content and a decrease in attention spans cause us to take in an absurd amount of information constantly. The brain only has so much capacity for processing data, and it can easily become fatigued. When your brain is overtired, you won't be able to think clearly or make decisions properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This often occurs when multitasking, which leads to the release of cortisol (a stress hormone) and adrenaline, which both contribute to triggering the "fight or flight" response in the body. Continuously shifting focus can affect how well you can recall or retain important information and decrease your ability to sift through unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/dont-think-youre-smart-might-have-these-rare-forms-of-intelligence"&gt;If You Don't Think You're Smart, You Might Just Have These 9 Exceptionally Rare Forms Of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sufyan Maan is a freelance writer who writes about personal growth and how to invest in yourself.

It is often caused by severe emotional or physical stress, such as&lt;a href="/topic/bereavement"&gt; bereavement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syndrome mimics the symptoms of a heart attack and doubles the risk of early death for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr David Gamble, from the&lt;a href="/topic/aberdeen-university"&gt; University of Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;, said: “In Takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal.

It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial randomly assigned 76 patients diagnosed with the condition to receive cognitive behavioural therapy, an exercise programme, or standard care. Those in the exercise programme were prescribed several forms of exercise, including cycling, running, and swimming, over the course of 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fTiivP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Those in the exercise programme could walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes by the end of the trial, up from an average of 457 metres" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-131188"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Those in the exercise programme could walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes by the end of the trial, up from an average of 457 metres&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trial, those in the exercise programme could walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, up from an average of 457 metres beforehand.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study co-authored by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor finds that life expectancy gains made by high-income countries in the first half of the 20th century have slowed significantly, and that none of the generations born after 1939 will reach 100 years of age on average.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2519179122" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, the study by Héctor Pifarré i Arolas of the La Follette School of Public Affairs, José Andrade of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and Carlo Giovanni Camarda of the Institut national d'études démographiques analyzed &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/life+expectancy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; for 23 high-income and low-mortality countries using data from the Human Mortality Database and six different mortality forecasting methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The unprecedented increase in life expectancy we achieved in the first half of the 20th century appears to be a phenomenon we are unlikely to achieve again in the foreseeable future," says Pifarré i Arolas. "In the absence of any major breakthroughs that significantly extend human life, life expectancy would still not match the rapid increases seen in the early 20th century even if adult survival improved twice as fast as we predict."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1900 to 1938, life expectancy rose by about five and a half months with each new generation. The life expectancy for an individual born in a high-income country in 1900 was an average of 62 years. For someone born just 38 years later in similar conditions, life expectancy had jumped to 80 years on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those born between 1939 and 2000, the increase slowed to roughly two and a half to three and a half months per generation, depending on the forecasting method. Mortality forecasting methods are statistical techniques that make informed predictions about future lifespans based on past and current mortality information. These models enabled the research team to estimate how life expectancy will develop under a variety of plausible future scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"We forecast that those born in 1980 will not live to be 100 on average, and none of the cohorts in our study will reach this milestone. This decline is largely due to the fact that past surges in longevity were driven by remarkable improvements in survival at very young ages," says corresponding author Andrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the 20th century, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/infant+mortality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; fell rapidly due to medical advances and other improvements in quality of life for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-income+countries/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-income countries&lt;/a&gt;. This contributed significantly to the rapid increase in life expectancy. However, infant and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/child+mortality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;child mortality&lt;/a&gt; is now so low that the forecasted improvements in mortality in older age groups will not be enough to sustain the previous pace of longevity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mortality forecasts can never be certain as the future may unfold in unexpected ways—by way of pandemics, new medical treatments or other unforeseen societal changes—this study provides critical insight for governments looking to anticipate the needs of their health care systems, pension planning and social policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a population-level analysis, this research also has implications for individuals, as life expectancy influences personal decisions about saving, retirement and long-term planning. If life expectancy increases more slowly, as this study shows is likely, both governments and individuals may need to recalibrate their expectations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Duke University's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center will
soon offer new mental and emotional support for its patients, their families
and their caregivers — all thanks to the donation of a former patient's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Durham native Rebecca Feinglos donated $250,000 to create the
Susan &amp;amp; Mark Feinglos Grief initiative in honor of her parents. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The program
was announced on Saturday, which is National Grief Awareness Day.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The money will support the creation of a grief pilot program to
support people connected to care at the tumor center.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos has lots of memories of Duke University and its medical
center.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"My parents came to Durham in 1972. My dad started his
residency at Duke and they never left," Feinglos said. "My mom
eventually became the director of the Duke Medical Center Library. My dad rose
in the ranks of the endocrine division here. He eventually became the Chief of
the division."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Not all her memories are good ones. Her mom was diagnosed with
Glioblastoma, the most deadly form of brain cancer when Feinglos was
five-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/duke-brain-tumor-center-grief-support-initiative-durham-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/duke-brain-tumor-center-grief-support-initiative-durham-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"I don’t have a lot of great (memories). I have a lot of
scary ones. I remember being scared of things. It is scary when your person is
going through any cancer," Feinglos said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Her mother, Susan Feingloss, died eight years later. Leaving
Rebecca's father, Mark, to raise her and her brother as a single parent.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"My dad was my best friend," Feinglos said. "Most
of my favorite memories with my dad are basketball games and Duke football
games."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos was working in education when her dad died of a sudden
illness in March of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"My mom's death is something I survived through and overcame.
That was a really hard thing in my life and I got through it and I was over it
and then when my dad died, it made me learn that you’re never over your
grief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/duke-brain-tumor-center-grief-support-initiative-durham-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/duke-brain-tumor-center-grief-support-initiative-durham-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos changed careers after her dad's death and started a grief
support organization called Grieve Leave.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"I am unlucky enough that my grief has been front-loaded and
I now I think have a weird privilege that I get to use the knowledge that I
have and help other people," Feinglos said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;"It’s an extraordinary problem and no one until [Rebecca] has addressed this."&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;As a continuation of her work to support those grieving, she has
now launched a philanthropy called the Feinglos Fund. It is through this fund
and Grieve Leave that she was able to donate the money to start the new grief program at
Duke's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"What we don’t have is anything that addresses the grief that
(patients), their family members and the medical team all feel from this,"
Dr. Henry S. Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Doctors Henry Friedman and Allen Friedman are Co-Deputy Directors
of the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center. They also knew Feinglos'
parents and treated her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"What do you say to a 5 year-old when her mom has a brain too
and how do you get the kid through that and that’s always been sort of in the
DNA of the brain quality of life work," Dr. Allen Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Henry Friedman said Duke's brain tumor center gets 3000
applications for care every year. Of those, the center treats about a thousand
patients annually.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"We send out a list every month of the number of patients
that we’ve lost and it's a very lengthy list," Dr. Henry Friedman said.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"But we don’t have though is any way to really help the patient while
they're being treated or in palliative care mode, for families either before or
after and medical care team that takes care of them, deal with the grief which
we will feel. It’s an extraordinary problem and no one until Becky has
addressed this."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, the money donated will go towards
researching best practices for how to provide grief support and putting the
findings into practice at the brain tumor center. &lt;/p&gt;

The hospital was also linked to an 2021 outbreak that hospitalized more than a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dchia"&gt;Don Weiss, a former city health official who helped coordinate past responses to infectious disease outbreaks, was critical of the fact that Harlem Hospital was once again at the center of an outbreak’s origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c1nv6"&gt;“They should’ve been keeping a really close eye on that,” Weiss said. “You should be way above the testing requirements to make sure you’re never again showing up on the news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="53ro9"&gt;The second building was a construction site for a public health lab at 40 West 137th St. overseen by the NYC Economic Development Corporation and the construction contractor Skanska USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fr9l"&gt;According to publicly available health department data, the hospital had been in compliance with rules requiring it to submit Legionella testing samples every three months. Its most recent sample before the outbreak was submitted in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="69o9e"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous Gothamist analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the rate of city inspections for cooling towers has been declining since the regulations were first implemented. After an increase in inspections immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic, numbers of inspections dropped again starting in 2022, after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene attributed the drop to staffing shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8f7kb"&gt;Morse, the health commissioner, said the buildings were identified through matching genetic samples from both the cooling towers and the people who were sickened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="832h"&gt;During the briefing, Deputy Commissioner Corinne Schiff, who oversees the Division of Environmental Health, said she didn’t know whether the construction site had conducted regular Legionella testing but that the department would investigate the site’s testing history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cs5i6"&gt;According to public data, however, there are no records of Legionella testing or city inspections for the construction site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ag1po"&gt;Chris Boyd, a former assistant commissioner at the health department who helped write new regulations for cooling towers in the wake of a 2015 outbreak that killed 16 people, said this outbreak was completely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1npf2"&gt;“The health department is masking the fact that this is not a naturally occurring phenomena,” he said. “It only occurs in systems that are not managed properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e32d8"&gt;Following Friday’s briefing, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a current mayoral candidate, called on the state Department of Health to conduct an independent investigation of the city’s handling of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8aeqi"&gt;“With the source of this outbreak now tied to a city-run facility, it is all the more important that an independent review be undertaken to ensure accountability, transparency, and public trust,” Cuomo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=6261123845ede52d0d0ec256e&amp;amp;id=99dd2ed872" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="84mhm"&gt;In response to the outbreak, Morse said the department will raise fines for building owners who fail to regularly test for Legionella bacteria. The department will also require building owners to test every 30 days instead of the currently required 90 days, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6hv3r"&gt;Additionally, Morse said the department will also try to hire more water ecologists to address the current staff shortage, but she did not provide details on whether the budget for those staff vacancies would be increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6etrp"&gt;A Gothamist &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lost-health-inspectors-in-years-preceding-harlem-legionnaires-disease-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the health department lost more than a third of its cooling tower inspectors in the past three years, despite a boost in funding for the unit in the department that conducts the inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPWnRpaDdhR3hOR0FONjZuS3plVEt1MTdRUG8yNGY3U09EeU1RQmx2SjRaaFBxby1nQXZoVzhIMDFMMi1SLXJUcG1OMk5MZmxMQ0gtNDU2UEt0T2p0dTR0dlR6NW9jNUdiT3Qwem0zMW9GdzBOMXlCNFlmRkFscVhEZEJMU2JiMlBSTk5RSkVjX0p1VlhFR1BFaDRVaEZwdw</guid></item><item><title>无食欲、肝脏问题、关节疼痛：对乙酰氨基酚是罪魁祸首吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/30/liver-damage-acetaminophen-rare-disease-medical-mystery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H3PNCPZRF5EFVJZGTXGVUAUUS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While lugging a mattress up the stairs, Matt Smith lost his grip, fell on a post and broke two ribs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, your food choices matter. The right foods not only keep you regular, but also feed your gut microbes, support digestion and make nutrients easier to absorb. One often-overlooked food is cereal—a surprisingly good choice for gut health.

He recommends this cereal for its high fiber content and mix of sprouted grains and legumes, which provide a diverse range of plant-based fibers. That diversity matters—research shows that eating a variety of plants is linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthier, more resilient gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

That’s because each plant contributes its own fibers and phytonutrients, which help to fuel a healthier gut microbiome, he explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research from the American Gut Project found that people with the healthiest guts were eating at least 30 different plants per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With seven plants in one bowl—wheat, barley, millet, lentils, soybeans, spelt and rosemary—this cereal makes it easy to achieve that goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Made with Sprouted Grains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sprouted grains are especially important for gut health because sprouting changes their nutrition. Sprouting starts the germination process in seeds and legumes, activating enzymes that naturally enhance their nutritional profile. “It increases the bioavailability of iron, zinc and other minerals, lowers phytic acid and other antinutrients, and generally results in food that’s easier to digest,” says Bulsiewicz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These changes make sprouted grains a smart choice for both nutrition and gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber plays many roles in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-to-support-gut-health-11791719" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting a healthy gut&lt;/a&gt;: it strengthens the gut lining, supports digestion and absorption of nutrients, feeds beneficial gut bacteria and helps to lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The problem is, an estimated 90% of adults do not eat enough fiber, which is why it’s important to start making it a priority.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By adding this to your diet, you can get an impressive 6 grams of fiber—21% of your daily fiber needs—in a half-cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Certified Organic &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Organic certification means the grains and legumes in this cereal are grown without most synthetic pesticides, fertilizers or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). “This also means that they weren’t sprayed with glyphosate after harvest, a common weed killer that’s often used to dry out wheat, legumes and other whole grains,” says Bulsiewicz. He points out that some research suggests glyphosate can negatively affect the gut microbiome, which is why he prefers to avoid it whenever possible.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair with Fruit.&lt;/strong&gt; Add berries, kiwi or apple for extra fiber and phytochemicals—compounds that feed your gut microbes and support overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top with Seeds or Nuts.&lt;/strong&gt; Sprinkle on some chia seeds, flaxseed, walnuts or almonds to get in more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats, plants and fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix It into Yogurt. &lt;/strong&gt;Add a handful of cereal to Greek yogurt for a satisfying, fiber- and protein-rich breakfast or snack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy It with Kefir. &lt;/strong&gt;Pour kefir over your cereal for an added gut boost. Kefir is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-probiotic-drinks-8727164" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fermented dairy drink rich in probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which work alongside the cereal’s fiber to support a diverse and balanced gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use It as a Crunchy Topping. &lt;/strong&gt;Try sprinkling the cereal over smoothie bowls, oatmeal or even a fruit salad for added crunch and an easy way to sneak in more plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for Fiber.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for cereals with at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Whole Grains.&lt;/strong&gt; Whole-food ingredients like oats, wheat or millet provide prebiotic fibers and phytonutrients that help diversify the gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Added Sugars Low.&lt;/strong&gt; Many cereals contain too much added sugar, which can offset the gut benefits of fiber. If you prefer a sweeter taste, consider adding some fresh fruit to your bowl instead, or choose cereals with 3 grams of sugar or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The golden rule of gut health is to eat for more plant diversity,” says Bulsiewicz. Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal makes this easier by delivering a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-fiber-than-beans-11785771" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich source of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, sprouted grains and seven plant ingredients in one bowl. It’s also the perfect base for gut-healthy additions like fruit, nuts and dairy, which bring even more nutrition into the mix. Together, these foods create the kind of variety your gut microbiome thrives on. When shopping for cereals, choose options that are high in fiber, made with whole grains and low in added sugars.&lt;br&gt;

After reading about low-dose minoxidil a few years ago, I got a prescription from my general practitioner and have been taking it ever since. My fine hair began to thin with menopause, and I could barely make a ponytail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F2LDXKIAXZBIDFFV47RSLCFJGE"&gt;I estimate its quantity has increased by 30% to 40% without any apparent side effects. For the first time in years, the hairline around my face has filled in and I’m not obliged to have a short fringe. Having more hair has been a great improvement and I will continue to take 2.5 milligrams of minoxidil daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FOOHKLXGRBGPLJB7JCHRENMDM"&gt;A. A recent systematic review of 27 studies of this off-label use of the blood pressure pill minoxidil found that 35% to 47% of participants noticed improved hair growth (Frontiers in Pharmacology, June 3, 2025). Most side effects were minor, although some people had unwanted hair growth and a few reported swollen ankles. The dose you are taking appears to be in line with the effective dose in these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PTNDC2S4QJF33KLZXL652I4ZPY"&gt;Minoxidil was originally approved to treat high blood pressure in 1979. The oral dose ranges from 5 to 100 milligrams daily. At those doses, though, side effects can be severe. Low-dose minoxidil (0.25 milligrams to 5 milligrams) is considered much safer but still requires medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AW27S6DSHFCL3LRTWJSJCAN7NU"&gt;Q.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnv000123b7agb1kzzt8@published"&gt;My mother-in-law, “Patricia,” is a recovering alcoholic with six years of sobriety. Recently, my sister needed me to take her and my 1-year-old nephew to an appointment with his pediatrician (her car was in the shop and her husband was at work). I left my 3-year-old son, “Harry,” with Patricia.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnwy00133b7avyak35cw@published"&gt;While I was with my sister, I received a call from a neighbor. She had been walking her dog when she came across Harry wandering the neighborhood in tears. He told her that “Grandma won’t wake up.” She took him home and found Patricia passed out. A nearly empty Scotch bottle (which had been a gift from a client to my husband; we don’t drink and were planning to re-gift it) was on the floor. My neighbor called 911, and then she called me. Patricia had to remain hospitalized for two days with alcohol poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnz300143b7asilu96do@published"&gt;Now my husband is blaming me for not hiding the Scotch “properly,” given that I know his mother’s history. The bottle was in our pantry behind the cereal boxes! The top of the bottle was visible, but it wasn’t exactly conspicuous, and honestly, it never occurred to me to “hide” it. And while it’s tragic that his mother had a relapse and became seriously ill as a result of it, it could have been even more of a tragedy for our son, outdoors alone looking for help, and that isn’t registering with him. Patricia has been extremely apologetic, but considering what happened, I don’t want her watching Harry on her own anymore. My husband says I am trying to “punish” his mother for what happened. As far as he’s concerned, it will never again be an issue since we don’t usually keep alcohol in the house. Am I going too far?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo5200173b7awyd93uhj@published"&gt;There’s too much I don’t know for me to make a ruling about whether forever banning Patricia as a sitter is “going too far.” Since she was the one you turned to in a non-emergency situation to sit for your 3-year-old, I’m guessing that she has three years of reliability and trustworthiness behind her. You’re in a much better position than I to determine whether what happened is an anomaly. (Your husband’s argument—that it won’t/can’t happen again because you won’t have alcohol in the house in the future—is specious.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo7400183b7afrfbyhzw@published"&gt;The bigger issue here, I think, is that your husband blames you for what happened. This is not a healthy or reasonable reaction. (I suspect that it’s a learned one; that rationalizing his mom’s drinking and blaming it on others was once a coping mechanism.) It’s also a problem that he is now angry with you for “punishing” his mom—as is, obviously, his failure to take seriously the jeopardy his mother put your son in.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can’t talk honestly about what happened without fighting (or talking past each other), get some help. As to having your mother-in-law babysit, I’d give it some time. In other words, for now and the immediate future, do not leave your child with her (you don’t need to make a big announcement about it; just don’t do it). See how things go. You can revisit this decision later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcjdu2002c3b7a7bqmv1ml@published"&gt;Is there such a thing as taking too many pictures of your kids? My husband, who is a great father, is really fanatical about taking photos of our only child, a 3-year-old girl. He takes pictures of her CONSTANTLY. He thinks it’s important to document every day, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/childhood-photos-too-many-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;so he’ll take a minimum of 10 photos daily, along with a few short videos.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. and his Make American Healthy Again movement have focused national attention on rising rates of childhood chronic illness, which they say are linked to kids’ diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some MAHA dietary claims — about the dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, for example — aren’t backed up by science. At the same time, researchers and experts are worried, to varying degrees, about &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402470/ultra-processed-foods-labels-fda-maha"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in kids’ diets, and about rising rates of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459910/kids-health-children-chronic-disease"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ve long been persuaded by research showing that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/well/eat/dieting-weight-loss.html"&gt;diets don’t work&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="/life/396193/red-dye-3-40-foods-fda-bans-kids"&gt;restricting kids’ food isn’t healthy&lt;/a&gt; for them. At the same time, I’m often unsure how to talk about kids and food in a time of both growing concern and growing misinformation about children’s health. How can parents and policymakers today do right by kids in a way that goes beyond obsessively checking food labels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For help with this question, I turned to Virginia Sole-Smith, whose work I’ve followed ever since she chronicled &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/magazine/when-your-baby-wont-eat.html"&gt;her baby’s struggle to eat&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times. Sole-Smith has a hard-won understanding of the fact that every kid’s needs are different, and that what may seem like harmless advice for feeding children can be unhelpful or even shaming. The author of the book &lt;a href="https://virginiasolesmith.com/books/fat-talk-parenting-in-the-age-of-diet-culture/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fat Talk: Parenting in the Age of Diet Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as the newsletter &lt;a href="https://virginiasolesmith.substack.com/"&gt;Burnt Toast&lt;/a&gt;, she’s one of the most vocal advocates of an anti-diet approach to feeding kids in a time when it seems we’re all supposed to be very panicked about what our children are eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a phone conversation, which has been condensed and edited, we talked about why food matters so much to kids, how MAHA messaging trickles down to young people, and what parents should actually be worrying about when it comes to children’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childhood is this time when you’re building your relationship to the world, you’re making memories, you’re exploring. Can you talk about what role food can play in that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s sort of two things to say there. One is, we as parents really want our kids to have a lot of joyful connections to food, and having food traditions and food rituals can really help kids feel grounded and connected to their family. For example, my mother makes these really great birthday cakes for my kids, and it’s just a great core memory of their childhood. Similarly, when I grow tomatoes in the backyard, my younger kiddo loves to go and just eat the Sungold tomatoes by the handful. And I’m like, &lt;em&gt;What a great childhood memory she’s making there. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the flip side of that is the fact that kids have very little control over their lives, how they spend their days, where they go, who they’re with. School in particular throws a ton of newness at them all the time, and they’re expected to go along with a lot of rules, and food is one of the very few things they can control. So it makes a lot of sense that kids are cautious around food, that they have extremely strong preferences around food, because this is one of the only ways they get to say no in their day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a time in American culture when adults are so, so anxious about what kids are eating. We have all these messages about ultra-processed foods, about food dyes. Are kids hearing that anxiety? Are these messages making it to them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I can remember my now-12-year-old when she was — I think this was her fourth birthday party; I was cutting up the birthday cake, and one of the kids said to me something like, &lt;em&gt;We shouldn’t eat too much of that. Sugar is not good for you&lt;/em&gt;. And I was like, &lt;em&gt;Birthday cake is really good for you because it makes us so happy&lt;/em&gt;. And she was like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, but not too much&lt;/em&gt;. And it was just like this little preschooler, clearly parroting her mom or her dad or whatever grown-up in the house was constantly worrying about their sugar intake, and it was really impacting her ability to just enjoy a birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I hear thousands of examples like that from my readers, like kids come home from school and say, &lt;em&gt;Mom, we can’t eat orange foods&lt;/em&gt;. Or, you know, getting worried about being a Goldfish cracker addict is one I’ve heard recently. Because they hear the way grown-ups talk about processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For adults at least, it feels like we’re in a really weird spot with body image and body positivity. There’s an awareness of what diet culture is, and a sense that it’s bad, but there’s still a lot of panic around &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect/410565/protein-muscle-gain-weightlifting-plant-based-vegan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what kind of foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; we should eat. And now there’s a lot of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/culture/417063/women-muscles-strength-weight-training-casey-johnston-amy-larocca-bonnie-tsui"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emphasis on being strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but we haven’t necessarily jettisoned the idea that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/culture/415457/summer-bodies-tiktok-fitness-gym-pilates-detox-gen-z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our bodies should look or be a certain way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How are kids thinking about body image? How are they thinking about the concept of diet culture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think there’s a lot of polarization happening. On the one hand, I’m really encouraged by the way I see Gen Z on TikTok talking about bodies. There’s often a lot of pushing back against fatphobia. There’s normalization of body hair, like a lot of Gen Zs not shaving their legs or their armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“When you try to solve for body size, you create a really toxic set of ripple effects around people’s relationships with food and their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the other hand, I think there are a lot of kids who, if they’re being raised in a MAHA household, a diet-culture-intensive household, are experiencing all of those expectations. You might want to check out &lt;a href="https://virginiasolesmith.substack.com/p/the-eating-enough-myth"&gt;the piece I ran on the newsletter&lt;/a&gt; about an influencer named Breanna Cox, who posted a reel where she was weighing her protein and explaining to her 11-year-old daughter why she meal preps that way, and the video ends with her daughter being like, &lt;em&gt;Can you make me one&lt;/em&gt;? And she’s so excited that her daughter wants to meal prep with her. She really framed it as like, &lt;em&gt;This is me helping her have a healthy relationship with her body, because I’m helping her make healthy choices.&lt;/em&gt; But she was really teaching her daughter restriction tools; it was diet behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to talk about the concept of childhood obesity. It’s something RFK Jr. and his team talk about in the MAHA report, but it’s also something experts are worried about: It’s mentioned in a study of children’s chronic illness published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; recently. How do you think about “childhood obesity” — should it be put in the same category as conditions like diabetes or asthma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I don’t think we should be pathologizing body size. It’s clear from the data that body sizes have trended upwards in the last 40 years. That trend has happened while we have been fighting a war on childhood obesity. So I think it’s clear that obsessing over body size has not made us healthier or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I also think the data doesn’t really support the idea that body size, per se, is a health condition. Body size might be a symptom of other health conditions; often, when people have Type 2 diabetes, weight drops dramatically or increases dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It might also be that kids today are bigger as a generation because of changes in the food supply. But that isn’t the problem I think we need to be solving. Because when you try to solve for body size, you create a really toxic set of ripple effects around people’s relationships with food and their bodies. Weight-cycling takes a tremendous toll on our bodies. So that doesn’t feel like the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We could be making school lunch and breakfast universally free and nutritious. We could be increasing food-stamp benefits to low-income families. We could be universalizing health care. There’s a lot of really obvious things we could do to make people healthier that really are all about fighting poverty and discrimination and social inequity. But when we make it all about weight, we’re really not dealing with any of those underlying issues. It’s a way of putting the blame on parents, putting the blame on kids themselves, and then stoking this whole other epidemic of disordered eating and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something you talk about a lot in your newsletter is how diet culture affects other aspects of life. Can you explain that a little bit? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Diet culture has taught us not to trust ourselves. It’s taught us to seek an external set of rules to tell us the best way to do something, the best way to be, and it’s telling us that following these external rules is going to ensure our health and happiness. It’s about selling people a problem so you can sell them a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I write about kids and screens a lot, I’m curious if screen time fits into this. Is screen time a diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s a really interesting one. I think a lot of our parental attitudes towards screen time are really diet-culture-based. And I put myself firmly in that camp. I struggle with being too restrictive around screens and seeing it backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I really like the work of Ash Brandin, who has a book called &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/ash-brandin/power-on/9780306836992/?lens=balance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When we demonize screens, we make them forbidden fruit, and we set kids up and ourselves up to feel like failures. Instead, we should think about: How are screens meeting our needs? And I think there’s a really good parallel there with processed foods. Maybe processed foods are not the platonic ideal of nutrition at all times, but how are they meeting your needs? Are they helping an anxious eater eat lunch in a busy cafeteria because his lunch is really predictable and comforting because the cheeses always taste exactly the same? That’s a valuable way to make sure that kid has lunch today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Are they helping a parent who works all day get dinner on the table faster because a jar of pasta sauce is easier to use than making your own from scratch every night? That’s a win, because you have dinner on the table. There’s all these ways that processes are not the enemy of nutrition. They’re not the enemy of a good relationship with food. They’re actually serving critical needs. And if we don’t want them to be the answer, we don’t want screens to be the answer, we really need to look at all these, you know, systemic care gaps that leave families needing to rely on these tools, and not make the families feel bad that these are our answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your message to parents who are seeing — not just from MAHA but from academics and researchers as well — worries about ultra-processed foods, about childhood obesity, and who are getting the message that they need to be really careful and vigilant about what their kids eat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What I found when I dived into the research was that the science pretty clearly shows that if kids have enough food to eat, then the minutia of nutrition works itself out. I see with my own kid; there’ll be a day where she eats nothing but cheese, and then the next day she’s living on tomatoes or cucumbers. Their eating patterns don’t look like my plate, they don’t look like what we’ve been told is the “ideal” way to feed a kid. But that doesn’t mean they’re not meeting their nutritional needs. Bodies are just really idiosyncratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What we really need to be worrying about is people having enough access to food, and kind of stripping away a lot of the other stress. Because anytime you start to make food into a power struggle with kids, you’re coming up against their need for control. You’re really telling them, &lt;em&gt;I should be the one to say what goes in your body&lt;/em&gt;, which is, I think, a really troubling message. I want my kids to be able to say no to broccoli, because I want them to know that their &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; really matters. I have daughters, and I’m thinking about future sexual situations, but across the board, we want kids to know that at their core, they have a right to body autonomy. They have a right to getting enough food to help them grow, and they have a right to some control around what that looks like. And if you do that, the nutrition piece sorts itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As severe weather events like hurricanes and &lt;a href="/climate/394882/wildfire-disaster-schools-kids"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt; become more common, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/severe-weather-school-finances-instruction-wildfires-hurricanes-extreme-heat/758548/"&gt;disrupting kids’ education&lt;/a&gt;. Every school day lost to weather disaster resulted in an average of 3.6 days of learning loss, &lt;a href="https://www.nwea.org/uploads/The-impact-of-severe-weather-on-education-revisiting-hurricane-katrina-while-preparing-for-the-next-disaster_NWEA_researchBrief.pdf"&gt;a new report found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tutoring programs meant to make up for &lt;a href="/education/372475/math-reading-school-covid-education-learning-loss-kids"&gt;pandemic-related learning losses&lt;/a&gt; didn’t help much, &lt;a href="https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-tutoring-effectiveness/"&gt;according to new research&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps because students just didn’t get enough hours of tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kids are saying “&lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/what-does-6-7-mean-current-trends-explained"&gt;6-7&lt;/a&gt;” now, apparently. It means…sort of nothing, and is used in part to annoy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My little kid has been enjoying &lt;a href="https://oliverjeffers.com/books/stuck"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a kite gets lodged in a tree and the situation really spirals from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last week, I wrote about &lt;a href="/life/458630/minecraft-roblox-gaming-kids-gen-alpha-culture-millennials"&gt;Gen Alpha popular culture&lt;/a&gt;, which can feel very fragmented and ever-shifting. One reader, however, noted that kids’ taste in books might actually be more monolithic. “I say this anecdotally from working with elementary school students, but also from articles like &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/heres-what-hennepin-county-library-cardholders-read-the-most-in-2024/601199436?utm_source=gift"&gt;this roundup of top 2024 library books&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that “Various titles from the Dog Man and Cat Kid Comic Club series, both by Dav Pilkey, took up all 10 spots for juvenile print books.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My older kid is a Dog Man hater, but I’ve definitely observed the cultural dominance of the franchise. Now I’m curious what the kids in your lives are reading. Is there still a monoculture when it comes to children’s books, or are their reading tastes all over the map?

And even otherwise, protein's mention for maintaining good health is quite widespread. But here's a reality check- your protein intake needs to be sustainable, it’s not just about a few months, but about building a natural dietary habit that lasts for decades, becoming a seamless part of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/30/550x309/protein_1756549340110_1756549340306.jpg" alt="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)" title="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/30/550x309/protein_1756549340110_1756549340306.jpg" alt="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)" title="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/protein-idli-mix-to-cookies-nutritionist-decodes-protein-fortified-foods-and-whether-you-actually-need-them-101752311156862.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Protein idli mix to cookies: Nutritionist decodes fortified foods and whether you actually need them"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein idli mix to cookies: Nutritionist decodes fortified foods and whether you actually need them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how do you go about it, making it a normal instinct so that you stop treating it as a chore and instead naturally include it in your daily routine?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fitness coach Raj Ganpath, who regularly shares fitness tips with his Instagram community, in an August 20 post, addressed this concern many people may have. To make regular protein intake sustainable across decades, he highlighted some strategies that simplify it over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are the 5 strategies Raj listed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Every meal should have some form of protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to make protein a part of your regular meals, not like an addition, but fundamentally integral to the dish you have, irrespective of what you eat and where you eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The coach added, “Make sure your every meal you eat contains some form of protein. What protein doesn't matter, how much doesn't matter- just make sure there is some form of protein in any meal that you eat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Protein should not be skipped, and it’s important to include it in some form at every meal, wherever you are. He said, “It could be breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack at home, outside in your city, outside your city, does not matter- make sure it is a part of your meal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Get accustomed to better protein sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to ensure you are choosing the right sources. Raj advised identifying the right sources, depending on whether you are veg or non-veg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He elaborated, "Identify protein sources that are actually rich in protein, based on your dietary constraints and make them a part of your day. For instance, if you are a meat eater, eggs, meat, sea food all that is great. But if you are a vegetarian, you need to eat low-fat cheeses, tofu, tempeh, soya chunks, things like that. You may not be used to it but try to identify them and include them, get used to them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often vegetarians, especially Indians, struggle with low protein intake as the sources are commonly thought to be pulses, but they may not be sufficient. This is why Raj stressed the fact that you need to adjust to the protein sources as per your dietary restrictions, even if foods like tempeh, tofu are new to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Protein not as a side to your main dish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you the one who includes boiled eggs alongside your main plate, holding your nose, and quickly eating them just to get it over with? If so, one reason your protein intake may fall short is that protein is treated as a side dish. The fitness coach also pointed out this issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said, "Make these protein-rich options a part of your meal, not just a side where you are force-fitting it into your meal. That means don't create a protein-free meal and then have protein on the side and think okay, I just have to somehow eat the protein, then I can enjoy my protein-free meal."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suggesting the solution, he continued, "Instead, try and make it a part of the meal, how do you include it in the recipes, that is the only way to make a part of your life in the long term."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So instead, try adding egg or whatever protein you have as one of the ingredients, like egg bhurji with green veggies to pair with your ragi roti.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Supplement when necessary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there are possibilities of falling behind your recommended protein intake despite diligent meal planning. Raj suggested taking a supplement to fill this gap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said, “If you are doing the first three steps and you are still not getting enough protein, you most definitely should supplement. This is precisely why supplements exist. So don't fight it. Don't overthink it. Try to get protein from real food if you are not able to supplement wisely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Track but don't obsess&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tracking your protein makes you aware of the protein amount you are consuming every day, hyperfixating on it may backfire. The fitness coach warned that constantly counting every last protein gram. It will just make you paranoid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raj said,“You should know how much protein you are getting. It is important because you are not getting enough of it, so maybe once a month or once in two months, do a breakdown and understand how much protein you are getting in grams, but don't get into the habit of counting protein grams every day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He instead suggested including protein in every meal, adopting a structure rather than measuring the numbers all the time. And every couple of months, the daily meals' protein amount can be checked, not every other day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

In the recent past, many young, athletic and seemingly fit individuals suddenly collapsed and died. This heartbreaking reality can occur without any warning, leaving family, friends, and teammates in distress. According to recent studies, including reports from Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health, India alone faces approximately 4.5 million cases of SCD each year, with many instances tragically occurring in individuals under the age of 35. This alarming trend underscores the importance of raising awareness and understanding this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/27/550x309/_b04e527c-109c-11e8-8db2-4ddb0f8cfdad_1756299214443.jpg" alt="A sudden cardiac arrest is the result of the defective electrical activity of the heart.

It can affect individuals who seem perfectly healthy and active, making it all the more terrifying. Understanding the causes of SCD is essential for effective prevention, as stated in Johns Hopkins Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people, especially athletes, are often at risk due to undiagnosed heart conditions that can remain hidden until triggered by factors like intense physical activity, stress, or illness, as per the Asian Journal of Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Here are some of the common conditions responsible for SCD:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM):&lt;/strong&gt; This genetic condition causes the heart muscle to thicken, making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood efficiently. HCM is one of the primary causes of SCD in young athletes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congenital coronary anomalies: &lt;/strong&gt;"These are structural defects in the coronary arteries that can significantly hinder blood flow to the heart, which can lead to catastrophic consequences", Dr Aditya Kumar Singh, Minimally Invasive Heart Surgeon, Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, tells &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)&lt;/strong&gt; is a rare disorder that affects the heart's rhythm and can lead to sudden disruptions in heart function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical disorders: &lt;/strong&gt;Conditions such as Long QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome can result in irregular heart rhythms, leading to fainting spells or even SCD in severe cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SCD can happen unexpectedly, being aware of specific warning signs can provide critical moments for intervention. The cardiothoracic surgeon shares some symptoms to keep an eye on:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath: &lt;/strong&gt;If you're finding it hard to breathe, especially during minimal physical activity, it could be a signal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain or discomfort:&lt;/strong&gt; Never ignore severe chest discomfort, as it may be a sign of a more serious underlying heart problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dizziness or blackouts: &lt;/strong&gt;Experiencing these symptoms during exertion can be a significant warning sign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexplained fatigue:&lt;/strong&gt; If you feel exhausted without a clear explanation, it’s essential to consult a healthcare provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart palpitations:&lt;/strong&gt; A racing heart or skipped beats can signal &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/world-heart-day-2023-adopt-these-lifestyle-changes-to-say-goodbye-to-cardiac-issues-101695971417499.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiac issues"&gt;cardiac issues&lt;/a&gt; that need attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you prevent sudden cardiac death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing SCD is a collective effort that combines awareness, education, and proactive health management. Here are some actionable steps that can help make a difference:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine cardiac screening:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular check-ups are important for identifying potential heart issues. A simple ECG can reveal potential concerns before they become more severe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase awareness: &lt;/strong&gt;"Educating athletes, coaches, and parents about the warning signs associated with heart conditions empowers individuals to seek help more promptly", says Heart Surgeon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training in CPR and AED usage:&lt;/strong&gt; Being prepared to act during an emergency can save lives. Training in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are essential skills that significantly increase the chances of survival following a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/cardiac-health-monsoon-risks-prevention/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiac incident"&gt;cardiac incident&lt;/a&gt;, as per the American Heart Association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution for those with family history:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a family history of heart disease or SCD, it’s vital to be vigilant and consult a healthcare professional about tailored strategies for monitoring heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is there any warning before sudden cardiac death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection of heart problems is not only beneficial but also life-saving.

The results were presented at &lt;a href="/topic/madrid"&gt;Madrid’s&lt;/a&gt; European Society of Cardiology congress, the world’s largest heart conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bundgaard said: “With a broader view we can say that higher dietary intake of potassium may not only benefit patients with heart disease but probably all of us, so maybe we should all reduce sodium and increase potassium content in our food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/blood-pressure-banana-lower-salt-b2736276.html"&gt;a study published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology&lt;/a&gt; found that eating more potassium can also lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anita Layton, one of the study’s authors, said: “Our research suggests that adding more potassium-rich foods to your diet such as bananas or broccoli might have a greater positive impact on your blood pressure than just cutting sodium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNV1dMVXJlMy1jRG1hTklLb09jNl9kZ2FRR25jZ0daTG53U3FhbW91TVdiOFUxb1BWaUE1UU1VcVBoZDdOYl9IS0hLU0hJT3gtTUdQRXFtYXN4Tm9UaEplYjZqcEhvUzhhQ3pZNG1PUVNqa2xJeEExTDZnOWxZclBRRnlMaTRnTUxjYi00cHNBdngzUUFjSEZKd2F0REc3RUZJOG4tMg</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，医生可能需要重新考虑一些患者在心脏病发作后数十年的常规β受体阻滞剂使用情况- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/doctors-rethink-decades-routine-beta-blocker-patients-after/story?id=125112970</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A large new study conducted in Spain and Italy found that beta blockers, drugs often used to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure, did not provide clear benefits for heart attack patients whose hearts were still functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The results of the study, known as REBOOT, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Saturday and presented during the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2025 in Madrid, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The REBOOT trial enrolled more than 8,400 patients recovering from a heart attack whose heart function was above 40% and assigned them to either take a beta blocker or no beta blocker within two weeks of leaving the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Medical equipment is seen in this stock photo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Westend61/Getty Images/Westend61&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Over the course of approximately 3.7 years, there was no significant difference when it came to rates of death from any cause, repeat heart attacks or hospitalization for heart failure between the two groups, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a “subanalysis” of the study, published in the European Heart Journal, researchers specifically looked at outcomes involving the approximately 1,600 women from the original REBOOT trial and isolated their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In this case, beta blockers were associated with an increased risk of death from all causes for these women, compared to women who were not taking beta blockers.

This was a smaller-scale study that combined two clinical trials into one because separately they were not able to enroll enough patients. Different rules for who could join each of the studies in each country may have skewed the results, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“REBOOT was a cleaner study in terms of protocol and inclusion criteria,” said Dr. Steven Pfau, professor of cardiovascular medicine and interventional cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Notably, REBOOT challenges over 40 years of standardized practice, which calls for patients admitted to the hospital for a heart attack to be started on beta blockers before or shortly after they are discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cardiologists’ methods for treating heart attacks and opening blockages in the coronary arteries in a timely fashion have improved drastically over the past 10-20 years, experts say. That's why, in an age of improved medical therapies and procedural interventions for heart attacks, such as better-performing coronary artery stents, it may be time to rethink the long-standing guidance on beta-blocker use, according to some experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Beta blockers were developed at a time before routine reperfusion therapy for acute heart attacks and the evolution of more potent medications, and care has really evolved,” said Fonarow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Pfau said that neither study makes a compelling case for beta blockers versus no beta blockers for this select group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“If beta blockers do have an effect, it is probably small, given the other therapies we have,” he said. “It fits the discussion for both studies that, with the way we currently practice, beta blockers potentially add very little to outcomes after a heart attack for patients with preserved heart function and no other pre-existing reason to be on a beta blocker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If patients can take beta blockers safely, they should keep using them for now, Fonarow advised.

At 96 of these surgeries, some 12,725 patients were tested with the upgraded kit, and patients at the remaining practices were analysed with a traditional stethoscope. If the patients were found to be at a high risk of heart failure, they had their diagnosis confirmed with a blood test for a hormone called BNP and a heart scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/heart-disease-cardiologist-advice-avoid-prevention-37hkkqxwm" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ten ways cardiologists avoid heart disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Patients tested with the new stethoscope were 3.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm that can increase the risk of having a stroke, and were almost twice as likely to receive a diagnosis of heart valve disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Patrik Bächtiger, from Imperial College London’s National Heart and Lung Institute and Imperial College Healthcare &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; Trust, said: “The design of the stethoscope has been unchanged for over 200 years until now so it is incredible that a smart stethoscope can be used for a 15-second examination, and then &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/artificial-intelligence" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; can quickly deliver a test result indicating whether someone has heart failure, atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:15:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxONHZTcmFZa1RZVC10aVVQaEFCNkNKdUxfbHlLS2tqTDNMbDZ2TnYwUTUySTV3Zkp5bDlYMTBLNUwxZmYtaUtGbGVKcEFaRDlkZ1pRTW1pZFpwMVZ1ZWZiN3ZtcnVscnNoS2RqaGhYbHlUdnoyVDJyenhzcnIxeTItWWY5cXZHbXoxX3YzcHpBWEF5NWZFVDVFVw</guid></item><item><title>应避免的五种超加工食品成分--以及应购买哪些成分--《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/upfs-ultra-processed-foods-supermarket-guide-b2815660.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1 sc-1wfc891-0 fooWDH" id="main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="big-letter"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;alk down any &lt;a href="/topic/supermarket"&gt;supermarket&lt;/a&gt; aisle and it can feel like you need a chemistry degree to shop for &lt;a href="/topic/dinner"&gt;dinner&lt;/a&gt;. From “high &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;” cereal bars to “low-&lt;a href="/topic/fat"&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt;” yoghurts and “plant-based” ready meals, the labels are designed to scream &lt;a href="/topic/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – but the ingredients list often tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these so-called “healthy” options fall into the category of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) – products linked to a growing list of health concerns, from weight gain and poor &lt;a href="/topic/gut-health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, more than half the &lt;a href="/topic/calories"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; we consume now come from UPFs, and among teenagers, that figure rises to nearly two-thirds. Research published in&lt;em&gt; BMJ&lt;/em&gt; has linked higher consumption of UPFs with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and early death – and yet they dominate our trolleys, often disguised as better-for-you choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These foods are engineered to taste irresistible, low in &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/topic/vitamins"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals and high in sugar, &lt;a href="/topic/salt"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; and saturated fat,” says Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Life&lt;/em&gt;. “They’re easy to overeat, can be addictive and often push healthier, nutrient-dense foods off our plates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the warnings, though, UPFs aren’t going anywhere (yet). They line every aisle, often hidden in plain sight and masquerading as healthy options – so where on Earth are shoppers supposed to start when it comes to making better choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The top five red flags on labels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to memorise the entire periodic table to navigate a supermarket, but Hobson says there are certain ingredients worth watching out for if you want to understand how processed a product really is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emulsifiers, for example, are designed to blend oil and water and create smooth, creamy textures in foods like ice cream, sauces, chocolate and plant milks. “Some studies suggest emulsifiers can alter gut bacteria and thin the gut’s protective mucus layer,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners are another marker of a highly engineered product. Aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame K are common in “diet” drinks, low-calorie snacks and many protein bars. “They’re considered safe by regulators, but some studies suggest they can subtly alter gut microbes or influence appetite regulation,” says Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modified starches, such as maltodextrin or modified maize starch, are also frequently used to bulk out foods and extend shelf life. “They are rapidly digested and contribute calories without fibre, which can spike blood glucose and add little nutritional value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavour enhancers, like monosodium glutamate (MSG) and yeast extract, are added to make snacks, sauces and ready meals taste richer and more satisfying. While “they are safe at permitted levels, they make savoury snacks and ready meals moreish, encouraging overconsumption of products that are often high in salt and fat”, Hobson explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hJHdNK"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/24/iStock-1429988564.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/24/iStock-1429988564.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/24/iStock-1429988564.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Shoppers are becoming more savvy – but with long, confusing ingredient lists, spotting a UPF isn’t always straightforward" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-107393"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Shoppers are becoming more savvy – but with long, confusing ingredient lists, spotting a UPF isn’t always straightforward&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are stabilisers and gums, such as xanthan gum, guar gum and carrageenan, which are added to yoghurts, sauces, plant milks and ice creams to create smooth textures and stop ingredients separating. “They aren’t ingredients you’d normally have at home,” and therefore a marker of foods that have been heavily engineered, but “while generally recognised as safe, some gums can cause digestive discomfort”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, he highlights protein isolates, which are increasingly common in protein bars, shakes and many plant-based meat substitutes. These include pea protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and soy protein isolate. The problem is, “they strip protein away from its natural &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; source,” says Hobson, “and while useful in certain contexts (like sports nutrition), they’re a signal the food has been reformulated rather than built from whole ingredients”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, Hobson adds, that many UPFs will contain a combination of these, and “while one additive on its own isn’t necessarily harmful, when you see several of these signals together, it’s a strong indication you’re looking at a food that has been manufactured in a way that prioritises convenience, taste and shelf life over nutritional quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to spot a UPF without overthinking it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to spend your entire shop glued to the back of every packet, Hobson suggests sticking to a few simple rules. One is the “five-ingredient rule”: if you don’t recognise five or more ingredients on the label, assume it’s ultra-processed. “Whole or minimally processed foods usually have just one or two ingredients, like oats, rice or tinned tomatoes, and even traditional foods like bread or cheese rarely need more than a handful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not foolproof, though: “A homemade curry paste or granola might have 10 ingredients and still be healthy,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-3 kqnNdl gGuqvP"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 jOpKWt"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7892fd45317565c6" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#ec1a2e" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one additive on its own isn’t necessarily harmful, when you see several of these signals together, it’s a strong indication you’re looking at a food that has been manufactured in a way that prioritises convenience, taste and shelf life over nutritional quality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wzq3bw-4 gIguDj"&gt;Rob Hobson, nutritionist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better shortcut might be the kitchen cupboard test. Ask yourself: would I keep these ingredients at home? “If you see ingredients like invert syrup, carboxymethylcellulose or artificial flavourings, then the answer is no,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaging can also be a giveaway. “Whole foods don’t need marketing,” says Hobson. “Fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs or rice speak for themselves. UPFs often come in bright wrappers shouting about ‘20g protein’, ‘low sugar’ or ‘fortified with vitamins’. These claims make products sound healthier than they really are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also suggests looking at the food itself: “If it no longer resembles the food it started from, then the chances are it’s ultra-processed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sneaky UPFs disguised as ‘healthy’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when you’re trying to make better choices, it’s easy to get caught out. “Flavoured instant porridge sachets are a good example,” says Hobson. “Oats themselves are healthy, but once sugar, flavourings and stabilisers are added, they slip into UPF territory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for cereal bars and protein shakes, which can be “more like science experiments to be honest”!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many plant-based meat substitutes sound virtuous but are often built on protein isolates, gums and flavourings. “While they can help people cut down on red or processed meat, many supermarket versions are made from protein isolates, flavourings and stabilisers, which is very different to simply eating beans, lentils or tofu,” he says, though admits there are still some that contain whole ingredients like lentils, beans and pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-fat fruit yoghurts are another trap: “They often lean more towards dessert once thickeners, sweeteners and colourings are added,” says Hobson. Even snacks that look healthy on the surface – such as lentil crisps, popped chips and baked vegetable puffs – are often extruded, flavoured and bulked out with emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Packaged foods that are actually fine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you need to avoid everything in a packet or tin. “There are plenty of packaged foods that people assume are bad just because they’re convenient, but they don’t meet the definition of a UPF,” says Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 juTIZT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2023/07/24/09/iStock-1395193135.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2023/07/24/09/iStock-1395193135.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2023/07/24/09/iStock-1395193135.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Not all packaged foods are bad news: tinned chickpeas can be a healthy choice" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-107394"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Not all packaged foods are bad news: tinned chickpeas can be a healthy choice&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned beans, lentils and chickpeas, for example, are usually just pulses and water – sometimes with a little salt – and are minimally processed. Frozen vegetables and fruit are another great option, often retaining more nutrients than so-called “fresh” produce that’s been sitting in the fridge for days. Plain porridge oats are still a healthy staple, as are nut butters made without palm oil or added sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even bread isn’t automatically a problem. “A simple wholemeal loaf from a bakery or made with flour, water, yeast and salt is not ultra-processed,” Hobson explains. “It’s the mass-produced supermarket loaves bulked out with emulsifiers, stabilisers and preservatives that fall into the UPF category.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Hobson notes, “if this is all you can afford, then choose wholegrain and put your efforts into reducing your UPF intake elsewhere, especially if you are trying to feed a large family on a tight budget”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How supermarkets and brands mislead us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just the ingredients list that makes UPFs confusing. Hobson says food manufacturers are experts at giving these products what he calls a “health halo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They often use front-of-pack claims like ‘high protein’, ‘plant-based’ or ‘fortified with vitamins’,” he explains. “These claims are permitted under UK labelling law and must meet certain criteria, but they can distract from the bigger picture, which is that the product may still be built from refined starches, sweeteners, emulsifiers and gums.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dHDAGL"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/26/GettyImages-2158918098.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/26/GettyImages-2158918098.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/26/GettyImages-2158918098.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Tinned foods get a bad rap, but beans, lentils, chickpeas and even fish are often minimally processed and make for smart, budget-friendly staples" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-107395"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Tinned foods get a bad rap, but beans, lentils, chickpeas and even fish are often minimally processed and make for smart, budget-friendly staples&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (AFP/Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tricks include highlighting what the product doesn’t contain – “low fat”, “sugar-free” or “no artificial colours” – and designing packaging to suggest wholesomeness, using earthy tones, images of fruit and grains and clever portion sizes that make calorie counts look smaller than they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of this makes it harder for shoppers to cut through the noise,” Hobson admits. “The more a product shouts about being healthy on the front, the more important it is to turn it over and check the ingredients list on the back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter swaps for your trolley&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson suggests starting with small, realistic swaps. Instead of flavoured yoghurts, buy a plain base and add your own toppings – fresh berries, cinnamon, nuts or honey. Oats are another easy win: make them yourself with fruit and spices rather than reaching for instant sachets full of additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-uwxkcg-0 sc-uwxkcg-1 kFyeaj iRwaYP"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-uwxkcg-4 bWnsxL number-length-3"&gt;56%&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-uwxkcg-5 gIRZFz"&gt;&lt;p&gt;of calories consumed in the UK come from UPFs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned beans, chickpeas, lentils and fish are simple, cheap and minimally processed, while frozen vegetables, berries and fish fillets are just as nutritious as fresh. Choosing microwave pouches of plain brown rice or quinoa instead of flavoured instant rice gives you the same convenience without the extra stabilisers and modified starches. Even your sauces can be upgraded with a few staples: passata, tahini, pesto and coconut milk all make quick, additive-free bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be complicated. “With the right basics in your kitchen, you can build balanced meals in 10 minutes that are every bit as convenient as UPFs, but far more nourishing,” says Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson is clear that the aim isn’t to eliminate UPFs entirely. “I don’t think cutting out UPFs completely is realistic or even necessary for most people,” he says. “Demonising them outright only creates guilt and anxiety, which isn’t helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s currently working with a charity to help families with four to six kids, who lack cooking skills and space to cook, to eat on a low budget. While research shows that diets high in UPFs come with greater health risks, it’s important to remember that not all UPFs are the same. The real issue, then, is when UPFs start to displace whole and minimally processed foods that we know are protective for long-term health. “The focus shouldn’t be on avoiding UPFs completely, but on balance and smarter choices,” says Hobson. “It’s not about perfection, it’s about tilting the balance so that the bulk of your diet genuinely nourishes you, while still leaving space for the foods you enjoy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOVVpkUWU5MzdfcUR6MmZxdl9tOWFlb1lWM1JfVGZXVlREY2FWZnhDdWZDZlhrZXpydk03SURRanJ4Vl91eWhoQnNKMU5tVFZyNDJBNkZ4eTc0YlNwSDRIZWNQTHdtZkQ5U0tONmNXOU9RaUNNX1pnMmJUOTB1WDZwR1AxcFp4NXhKaFRwYjdQV25zOTBlZVZ3M1VKa05jY09OM1RxNDA2TEtiaTRqbi1yMnVLSndUYVppNHNqZkZhMVo</guid></item><item><title>本周科学新闻：全球首例猪-人肺移植， SpaceX的星际飞船完成试飞- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/surgery/science-news-this-week-a-world-first-pig-to-human-lung-transplant-and-spacexs-starship-nails-a-test-flight</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

Not knowing his dog was there, the anonymous man rolled over and accidentally punched his dog in the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Startled, the pet bit his owner on wrist.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though he thought nothing of the bite at first, he went to his local urgent care three days later after his arm became swollen and covered in red, coin-sized pustules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then was admitted to the hospital. Not long after that, his blood pressure dropped to 53/30, dangerously low compared to healthy pressure of 120/80. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low blood pressure means there is less oxygen in the blood, and if left untreated, the condition can cause vital organs like the heart and brain to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors found the man was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13857217/man-contracts-flesh-eating-disease-childhood-virus.html"&gt;suffering from necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as 'flesh-eating disease,' a severe bacterial infection that spreads quickly and kills healthy tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the disease destroyed his tissues and infiltrated his bloodstream, it caused sepsis, a life-threatening overreaction to an infection that causes blood pressure to plummet and the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The low blood pressure deprives tissues and organs of oxygen, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13165721/sepsis-crisis-killer-infections-hospital.html"&gt;causing them to fail and die&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The man's dog, Scotty, is pictured here. Scotty still lives with his owner and has caused no further issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what bacteria exactly caused the infection, but doctors told the man it 'lives on human skin.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,000 species of bacteria are naturally found on human skin and are generally harmless. The most common are Staphylococcus aureus (staph) and Streptococcus pyogenes (strep), which live inside the nose and on the skin of between 10 and 30 percent of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the man estimated there was just a one in 10,000 chance the bacteria would enter his bloodstream through an opening like a dog bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1mnxjeu/i_survived_necrotising_fasciitis_and_septic_shock/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;: '[Doctors] told me that it was almost certainly not from his mouth but from my skin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis, in which bacteria eats at skin, muscle and tissue until they shrivel up and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It kills about one in five patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'I knew as soon as I woke up and looked at my arm that I was in a lot of trouble. I'm lucky I woke up in time, if I'd stayed asleep I wouldn't be here.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His arm had turned 'bright red' and tripled in size. It was also covered in coin-sized pustules. Despite the alarming appearance, he only had minimal pain that felt like a sunburn, though he was also dizzy and nauseous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria entering the man's bloodstream triggered a whole-body immune reaction, called sepsis, which affects 350,000 Americans every year and kills one every 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The blurred image shows the man's arm with skin torn away and his tendons showing due to the flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis is usually treated with antibiotics for the underlying infection and medications called vasopressors, which divert blood flow back to vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this takes blood from 'non-vital' areas like limbs, increasing the risk of tissue death and amputations. This is why the man's blood pressure dropped dangerously low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being rushed into surgery, doctors managed to save his arm, 'although it was close going,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the infection didn't reach the bone, in the past four years, he's undergone 20 surgeries to remove dead tissue, graft skin from other parts of his body on to the affected arm and reconstruct his hip and Achilles tendon due to long-term damage from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said his arm has regained 'about 90 percent function,' but he needs regular monitoring due to lasting organ damage from the sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'We're still trying to quantify exactly how bad the damage is, but at this stage I'm pretty optimistic. My final liver scan is this Friday, my kidneys appear to be ok, heart only took minor damage, brain is still a question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm slower than I was, and struggling with memory a bit, but I'm still pretty medicated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The man said he has had 20 surgeries to repair the damage. The above images show his progress from several years ago (left) and what the arm looks like now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said his treatment totaled $500,000 AUD ($325,000 USD), but because Australia has universal healthcare, he only paid about $1,000 AUD ($650 USD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the dog bite triggered the cascade of events, the man doesn't blame his pup, Scotty, and still has him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'He's kept me company, and sane, through all of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Animals don't intend to hurt people, they just sometimes do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He urged people who suffer deep wounds like his to 'immediately clean, disinfect and dress it once you've stemmed the bleeding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Get your backside to a medical professional ASAP. I waited a day because my regular doctor was booked out for the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I should have gone straight to an [emergency department] or urgent care and gotten antibiotics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 03:10:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdXFhNEpDQlF6NzFjUkRXZmdray1GaGs1RDFpMXJZRnR2UXZQUU9YSG5NMEhfLVpiOEVrSkhwZGxEVC1wX2xqalcxM1lJcHpKX0dWNHdOWUJQWjBmSldYcll2aThtWHNSekJDZXM4VG9zRXJTSTN4U05oekwzV21SR1liRWRaTU5hWHdtSGpuOF9OakdEQVAtVGNqQTBKemQ1QmpV0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1vT0ZNQlQ0ZUUwblBXUk9fMGRUSlFXZnVDbm1KSWJVTzVYTjVQa2ZBcnJkYkxYcXFld1pzN2x4SzI4dzRNZm1RenZHNnRyYnd3SEFzNUFmeWFlaFBLelJ5VTFlY1YtSWloMk1jVnI0ZFBGQ2Q1Y0pRdE4yNHVVSTBaeENMUTFxTzBaV2dDNmIyd3BFWlJzWUlyQ3N0U0RJZU56ODM4S3Q5Vg</guid></item><item><title>我和狗睡觉感染了感染，导致我毁容-《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15036609/flesh-eating-bacteria-sepsis-dog-bite-reddit.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man who suffered a bite from his dog contracted the life-threatening infection &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-89706950-8449-11f0-afe1-ad8a3fe21a15"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; and has been left permanently disfigured.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, from Australia, was asleep in his bed when his dog laid down next to him.

I waited a day because my regular doctor was booked out for the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I should have gone straight to an [emergency department] or urgent care and gotten antibiotics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 03:10:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdXFhNEpDQlF6NzFjUkRXZmdray1GaGs1RDFpMXJZRnR2UXZQUU9YSG5NMEhfLVpiOEVrSkhwZGxEVC1wX2xqalcxM1lJcHpKX0dWNHdOWUJQWjBmSldYcll2aThtWHNSekJDZXM4VG9zRXJTSTN4U05oekwzV21SR1liRWRaTU5hWHdtSGpuOF9OakdEQVAtVGNqQTBKemQ1QmpV</guid></item></channel></rss>
