It’s in pharmacies, parties, pain clinics, and political speeches. Many use it to sleep better, relax, or deal with pain. Some cannabis users even see it as a natural alternative to pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the world embraced cannabis, heart doctors started noticing something else. A new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Heart&lt;/em&gt;, based on data from over 432 million people, has revealed a clear &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who use cannabis have a much higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and even dying from heart disease. That’s not fear-mongering – it’s data from .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-people-are-using-stronger-cannabis"&gt;More people are using stronger cannabis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In over half of the states in the U.S., and in some countries in Europe, like France, doctors can give cannabis to patients as medicine, but using it just for fun is still illegal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s not allowed for fun, many young people in France still use it a lot. Germany recently changed its laws and now lets people use cannabis recreationally, starting in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now more people use cannabis, and the products they’re using are stronger than before. Today’s cannabis has more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-reveal-the-most-complete-cannabis-genome-yet/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt;. That means stronger effects on the brain and body – especially the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-to-heart-problems"&gt;Cannabis linked to heart problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 3,012 studies. Among them, 24 studies were focused on the link between cannabis and major heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the research showed that people who use &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; have a 29 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 20 percent higher risk of stroke, and more than double the risk of dying from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regular-use-raises-stroke-risk"&gt;Regular use raises stroke risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk didn’t look the same in every study. A few didn’t find strong links, especially in people who used cannabis once or twice. But when the researchers zoomed in on heavy users or younger adults, the risk became clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, one study found that people who used &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-in-any-form-directly-linked-to-significant-risk-of-heart-damage/"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; weekly were nearly five times more likely to suffer a stroke or mini-stroke. A U.S. hospital database also found increased risk, especially in people aged 25 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that occasional cannabis use may not be a red flag. But regular use, especially while young, is when things start looking risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-to-more-heart-attacks"&gt;Cannabis linked to more heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study showed that cannabis users aged 15 to 22 were 36 percent more likely to have a heart attack. Another found that people using cannabis &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-use-directly-linked-to-head-and-neck-cancer/"&gt;more than once a week&lt;/a&gt; had more than double the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s after adjusting for tobacco, cocaine, and other drugs. Cannabis came out as the strongest predictor in a French hospital study – even stronger than &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-cocaine-tricks-and-hijacks-the-brain/"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not the story we usually hear about cannabis. But these numbers speak louder than opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-higher-death-risk-from-heart-disease"&gt;Higher death risk from heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of fatal cardiovascular events was also investigated. In one study, young patients who had heart attacks and also used cannabis were far more likely to die. The link remained consistent even after controlling for smoking and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study conducted in the United States confirmed that cannabis users had a much higher chance of dying from heart-related causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, a 2024 study revealed an unexpected twist. Women, not men, faced higher risks of heart-related death from heavy cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-the-benefits-of-cannabis"&gt;What about the benefits of cannabis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis has shown several proven medical benefits, especially when used under a doctor’s guidance. One of its most recognized uses is for managing chronic pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with conditions like arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or nerve-related injuries often find relief through cannabis-based treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plant’s compounds – mainly THC and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-extract-cbd-proven-highly-effective-at-killing-mosquitoes/"&gt;CBD&lt;/a&gt; – can interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system to reduce pain signals and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical cannabis also &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-may-ease-cancer-symptoms-like-pain-and-nausea/"&gt;helps cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; by easing nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, and in some cases, it can stimulate appetite for those struggling with weight loss due to illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have also used cannabis to help patients with neurological disorders. In certain forms of epilepsy, especially in children, CBD-based medications have reduced the number and severity of seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These examples reflect how cannabis, when used appropriately, can provide real and sometimes life-changing benefits for patients, making it easier for some to ignore the overall health implications attached to cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-urge-tobacco-style-warnings"&gt;Experts urge tobacco-style warnings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets,” noted Professor Stanton Glantz and Dr. Lynn Silver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts emphasized that today’s cannabis is not what it used to be. It now includes potent concentrates, synthetic versions, and a growing variety of edible and inhalable forms. These may carry risks beyond the cannabinoids themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specifically, cannabis should be treated like tobacco: not criminalized, but discouraged, with protection of bystanders from secondhand exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors should ask about cannabis use, particularly when it comes to patients with heart problems. For people using cannabis regularly, it’s time to rethink the idea that it is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a

after contact with a stray dog in Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the person became infected while on holiday in the North African country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The agency said there was no risk to the wider public due to no documented evidence of rabies passing between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Close contacts of the person and health workers were being assessed and offered vaccinations when necessary as a precaution, a UKHSA spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rabies can cause a life-threatening infection of the brain and nervous system in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is passed on through injuries such as bites and scratches from an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is nearly always fatal, the UKHSA said, but post-exposure treatment is "very effective" at preventing disease if given promptly after exposure to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Katherine Russell, from the UKHSA, said: "Human cases of rabies are extremely rare in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal in a country where rabies is found then you should wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without

been reported in the UK between 2000 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rabies is particularly common in Asia and Africa, the UKHSA said, with people visiting affected countries advised to avoid contact with dogs, cats and other animals wherever they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The agency also advised people to seek advice about the need for a rabies

Those aspects include muscular health, balance, flexibility and body composition, he said, each of which is important for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/06/cellular-reprogramming-longevity-reverse-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;longevity and health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCKKYEJ2EZCMVK4HM4XTWPRHM4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study, middle-aged and older people who needed no support to sit or stand were about six times less likely to die of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/24/heart-disease-strokes-cardiovascular-death/" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and other cardiovascular conditions during the next decade or so than people who wobbled and had great difficulty completing the task.

First find a partner. “Don’t do this test on your own,” Araújo said. Your partner will watch you, score your test and, most important, steady you if you start to topple. (If you have disabilities or serious joint problems, such as hip, spine or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/20/strength-training-arthritis-risk-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;knee arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, you probably shouldn’t do the test, Araújo said, since it could cause unnecessary pain or injury.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="IZJZQRG63VEOFGUB57FSRYYGBE" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clear a level space so you have room to maneuver but also, if needed, still have a wall, chair or other support nearby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the floor is bare, put down a pad in case you land with a thump while sitting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remove your shoes and socks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stand with your feet slightly apart, then cross one foot in front of the other.

It incorporates so many aspects of fitness, for one thing, it’s hard to know which are weakest if our scores are low, said Avril Mansfield, a professor of physical therapy at the University of Toronto, who studies mobility and balance. She wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KMWYMHM7ZREHHFMB6MUZTGM2KA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is the problem mostly our flexibility, strength, range of motion, balance or some combination of several of those? “Working with a professional like a physiotherapist or a clinical exercise specialist could help you identify the specific physical limitations” that are impairing your score, she said, “and design an exercise program to address those limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4OJG6D6P7JENHEFJKV57FGWUT4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This test also could be daunting or inappropriate for many people, said Lora Giangregorio, a professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada who studies falls and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/17/bone-health-osteoporosis-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and wasn’t involved with the study. “It requires people to get off of the floor in a prescribed way that requires very good joint mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VNFXWJSC35F6VNYKITNBY2SESU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/arthritis-joint-pain-remedies/2020/10/16/5c1beab0-08a2-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;joint pain&lt;/a&gt; or other disabilities or are older and feel infirm, other tests of mobility are likely to be safer and more reliable, she said. Try, for instance, &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/157303" target="_blank"&gt;the 30-second chair stand test&lt;/a&gt;, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to assess physical performance in older people, she said. Simply count how many times you can rise from and sit back onto a chair seat in 30 seconds, without using your hands. Men younger than 60 should manage, at minimum, 15 and women that age at least 13. Average scores decline by one or two per decade after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SGSRUWU4GZC6NE4IS7GHCJO4XU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The sitting-rising test and the new study also don’t tell us why the test predicts mortality, although Araújo believes low scores indicate underlying disease and frailty. People who are inflexible also often have stiff arteries, he said, contributing to heart disease, while people with poor balance could be predisposed to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/09/fall-risk-older-adults-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;serious falls&lt;/a&gt;, which can precipitate physical decline and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EIOTMPFAWZC75K4U45ESJ6BZLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps most important, though, a low score is a portent, but not a promise, he said. “People ask me all the time, ‘If my score is low, does that mean I’ll be dead in five years?’ I tell them, ‘Of course not,’” Araújo said. But it can be a wake-up call, he added. “It’s telling you, maybe you need to make some changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 11:14:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQYzc0TVJjQ2dDNlozMU8wc1h5T0JfeVdURGNxYnFLZ21XMzk3RFU5M0hxX1R4bUlWUmdkbEQ2d01CdER1WncwLWpsdjgyaXhEaG1rSTFrSFVoNVhYTGtWVERqVW5wWWRmRHJsQ2FUMUx2RlJnNVdwam9PbGhETGdQQmNlU3VPQlpv</guid></item><item><title>他定制的癌症疗法在美国国立卫生研究院的冰箱里。他可能无法及时得到它。-《华盛顿邮报》 | His custom cancer therapy is in an NIH freezer.

That day, he&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;called a medical team at the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/03/05/nih-trump-turmoil-grants/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; that had created an experimental cell therapy, custom-made to attack his cancer as part of a clinical trial. He needed it. Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IUTFDGVOVGKTKEAXIJIZHF4KU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, he received more bad news: His therapy would be delayed at least a month because of staff cuts at NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E7ZA32GA5BERJBSOSPXQAYR3VI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A week later, Schlueter and his wife, Michelle, saw NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya push back on &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/06/09/nih-scientists-bethesda-declaration-trump/"&gt;concerns raised&lt;/a&gt; by his own staff that the ouster of essential employees and other disruptions to the biomedical research agency were harming science and patients. Bhattacharya said on X that objections raised in a document called the Bethesda Declaration contained &lt;a href="https://x.com/NIHDirector_Jay/status/1932137905939431769"&gt;“fundamental misconceptions”&lt;/a&gt; about NIH’s new direction. Each &lt;a href="https://x.com/NIHDirector_Jay/status/1932137914143473689"&gt;termination &lt;/a&gt;was being reviewed, and some workers were reinstated, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EVQEFDWQ35EIDDQOFKR5YMX6T4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the Schlueters had a front-row seat to the effects of the job losses. Richard’s therapy was in a freezer, nearly ready to go. All along, they had been told the final step of preparation takes three to four weeks. But on June 3, his NIH doctor informed him that it would now take eight to 10 weeks because of cuts to essential lab personnel — a painful illustration of the life-and-death stakes of the administration’s approach to shrinking the government workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RPVOBV2JOBD5VNPSBBX6GR7IPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I’m petrified.

Two highly skilled technicians who prepared cells for treatments were fired in the probationary purge in February, according to Steven Rosenberg, an NIH immunotherapy pioneer who leads multiple trials. He declined to say how many patients were affected, but his team now treats one patient per week, down from two or three before the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OXRUKAHA5ZGJ7PYN7RQAAASQSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are some patients who might have to wait until September,” Rosenberg said. “These are all patients with metastatic cancer that is progressive. You can imagine the difficulty as we have to tell them these things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4E5B7UQ63NANPFGSE5VSUPUXQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An official with the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, said the agency had ways of addressing the delays. Rosenberg has been granted permission to hire contractors or to request help from other scientists from across NIH, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to criticize an employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HXII36IIINENHJZSKDY75VKMNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rosenberg said he has been working urgently to try to rehire a scientist who was fired since he was given permission to do so last week, but the federal contracting process is slow and the scientist has been interviewing for other jobs. He noted that to prepare the cells for patients requires special training that takes four to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="E67KUXIYENGAHLOK3TPTHTXDGI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="E67KUXIYENGAHLOK3TPTHTXDGI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;National Institutes of Hope&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKHVOVZ26NEC7HN34G4QCRN3IA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Richard’s cancer nightmare started with what he thought was acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R5K7C5KKVNBFLL63YKLDVAF2PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few weeks after his annual physical in January 2024, he noticed a metallic taste in the back of his throat. Looking in the bathroom mirror, he saw little white pustules on one of his tonsils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FDYCZPHSFREGFNL5CWW22NU6J4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A scan and biopsy showed it was head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but an oncologist told him it was treatable, with an excellent chance of success.

He had always taken good care of his health and was diligent with his treatments. But a scan in July revealed that the cancer had spread to his lungs and part of his chest cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XMYT3XNVK5ESNOLX7TGJ6RQLXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was heart-wrenching, and it was difficult,” said Richard, a founding partner of an Atlanta law firm. “I’m a fact-finder, and I spend a lot of time researching and trying to find a path to remission or a potential cure. And it’s a pretty bleak outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VI3NSCQUVRAVPCTQB5XW6327WI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Richard’s efforts led him to NIH, where he felt blessed to qualify for a trial led by Rosenberg. Doctors would take a biopsy of his cancer and find and isolate immune cells called TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. They would use lab tests to select the cells that recognized Richard’s cancer and expand the population. Then, they would reinfuse them into his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DEIIPXFS4FBURITQ4NP3NUDDWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are no guarantees with clinical research. Patients who qualify for the trial have exhausted standard treatments. But it gave the Schlueters something they had been missing: hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJZNAAPJ3ZDGFJ4U7PNPC6EN6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Patients often refer to us not as the National Institutes of Health, but the National Institutes of Hope,” Rosenberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5BMEE6L5RF5FK3H2E6IMSTE7E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In January, Richard went to NIH for surgery to remove two tumors in his lungs and begin the process of isolating and testing the TIL cells. He read the NIH credo — to improve the human condition throughout the world — emblazoned on a wall of the Clinical Center and was so moved that he sent a photo of it to his three children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RIWPPSJKSFEJPFELNWJJOJVF4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The staff, the physicians, the amount of empathy, care and mission that I’ve experienced over four visits to their research hospital has been just super gratifying,” Richard said. “In many ways, I’m a guinea pig that may be helping other people. But I also have the byproduct that if it works, it will help me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRPTHP2UC5AWBICKW5EKBFO6ZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In late March, Richard returned to NIH, thinking it was go time. Instead a scan showed that the tumors in his lungs had unexpectedly become smaller. He returned home, knowing his therapy would be ready in the freezer if he took a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AYY3GMXTFNEETAECQH542YMJTY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AYY3GMXTFNEETAECQH542YMJTY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;No time to wait&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CL5GHFFPOBDITFM4DTZVYZBLEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Rosenberg’s team meets every Monday to discuss patient cases, and for months they have had to make difficult calls to seriously ill people.

But that made her vulnerable, as a probationary employee&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with fewer protections. Rosenberg is trying to hire her back on contract using nongovernment funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HPL5Z4I4EFHF5KMMXJKRVY4EVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Richard is an optimist.

Ferris, a head and neck surgical oncologist at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, said patients such as Richard have tough and tragic cases where standard medical care has been exhausted. Ferris is not involved in Richard’s care, but the doctor said the trajectory of a cancer like this is grim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZZTIZ45EJCHJD4JVVL5XT5NKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is unlikely the cell therapy will cure Richard, Ferris cautioned, but science progresses through individual cases like his. And if Richard is forced to wait too long, he could be too frail to try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z62ZKI7O2VCOPI47ZKA2VPJUEA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If the cells are ready, you would want to give it to him now,” Ferris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CWBUVPJXEVBK7JG3J4X47NG7AA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In mid-May, Richard was golfing with his nephew and his son. He was running, swimming, biking and lifting weights.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The only sign something was awry was a red rash on his face that resembled&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a sunburn, a side effect of one of his treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GBCULZ23JDOPPAMCDWSIVYO6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But as the cancer has spread through his bones, his arms have become weak, and he has a suspected microfracture in his right arm. Pain in a hip&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;makes it hard to get out of a chair. The Schlueters’ 30th wedding anniversary celebration in early June was a joyous occasion, but Richard struggled to walk down the aisle to renew their vows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LV4AUS77SFDADK6XJSAU3HI4K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even if the therapy doesn’t save Richard, his family hopes his experience can help others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="APLBWVV7C5HJ5CCOJEOFNQHFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If he misses [it], not only is it is it devastating for his family, but it’s devastating for all the patients behind him that could have learned something scientifically — on why it was successful or not successful,” Michelle said. “He’s like a test pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 10:03:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOUHI5eVVzUEhBT21kVXNkaTR0SzNTeDZ6XzN6aVgtS3lBTHZZQXlhbmxsLW1fdFpTNkNVME5oODdNNEt1d0dsNFk0Vlp3ZFZBNVhSOEtLTWp3QkJPZXRRbXVJU1RtQnhUc3BBN1kwNWRydEFRdUxQZXpmYmp2LU5aNzZKb3FXcmJSWXNrLTlJWQ</guid></item><item><title>救命！我的前妻坚持要溺爱我们的女儿。它导致了可怕的后果。- Slate Magazine | Help!

Our daughter is nearly 9 and can’t swim, sleep by herself, ride a bike, or even pour herself a bowl of cereal. Her mother does all of it. She claims our daughter needs her to do all this, and she will magically be able to do it all when she gets older. My daughter used to be outgoing and adventurous, but now she is afraid of her own shadow and prone to meltdowns when you push her out of her comfort zone. I do my best to teach her and encourage her, but it is always one step forward and three back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="173" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzjxrm900053b78xmpip83t@published"&gt;I have signed her up for lessons, and her mother refused to take her on her days. My ex had her remote position terminated and now has to go into the office. By some small miracle, I was able to get my daughter into a local day camp. It is barely the start of the summer, and we already have trouble. During my week, my daughter gets afraid and fussy, but ends up really enjoying the camp and making friends. When it is her mother’s turn, she has full meltdowns and needs to be picked up early. My ex says this is proof that the camp is “too much” for our daughter, and the solution should be that my wife watches her since she works remotely. My wife works on contract and is pregnant. She flatly said that my ex is out of bounds and she isn’t going to parent my daughter without me around. I feel like I am caught between a rock and a hard place. What do I do here?&lt;/p&gt;

You have decided not to push for full custody of your daughter despite your wife’s stance. You know that she is safe and healthy at your ex’s home. How great for you. Your kid is being coddled, but she’s not being abused, neglected, or scarred. She gets a lot of help and nurturing. Is she behind other kids her age when it comes to independence? It sure sounds like it. But luckily, there’s no plan to send her out in the world to fend for herself or be dropped into the ocean and have to swim to safety in the next few years, right? What’s your biggest fear about the consequences of the way she’s being parented right now? Is it rational?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd64u001j3b77tbpojpdn@published"&gt;I also think you should explore the possibility that her regression and her emotional fragility may have something to do with her parents’ divorce, including whatever experiences led up to that, in addition to her mom’s parenting style. If I were in her position—a sensitive kid who’s been through a tough time and who is a bit younger for my age than my peers—what I’d want from my dad would be acceptance, patience, and encouragement, not the message that I was horribly flawed because of the way I was being raised.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzk3hx0000d3b78947athr8@published"&gt;So when she is with you (I can’t tell how often that is), please don’t give the impression that you’re alarmed by how terribly she’s doing or reveal that you think her mother is the worst. Offer her opportunities to experiment with more independence in low-pressure ways. Set her up to do small tasks on her own and celebrate when she succeeds. Create a fun room for her and see if she’s excited about sleeping on her own there. Look for any chance to tell her that you think she’s very smart and capable and that you trust her. If you must panic about her being behind on bike riding, do it in private.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s painful, embarrassing, sometimes restricts physical movement, and treating symptoms is expensive. It’s not well understood, but doctors have told me my best chance of avoiding it is keeping a low BMI. So, I eat very carefully and maintain a strict exercise schedule, and keep my BMI at 19. Even during pregnancy, I was very careful (hormonal shifts like puberty, pregnancy, and menopause are potential triggers), and so far, I’ve dodged this bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6bx001m3b77bcgfxd2w@published"&gt;My husband and I have a blended family. We have full custody of 10-year-old “Katherine,” but we also have a child together, 6-year-old “Delilah.” I consider them both my kids in every way that matters. I try to make sure that I don’t treat them differently and that I teach them the skills they need to be healthy. But as puberty approaches, I’m realizing that I have no idea how to talk about food and eating. With both kids, I’ve always talked about eating when we’re hungry and stopping when we’re full, and eating lots of different foods. They have treats, but we try to make that normal, too. I say this stuff, but my husband is the only one who actually sets a physical example because I need to keep my weight low. With Kathine, I’ve emphasized self-confidence with her changing body and encouraged her to recognize that body shape can do all kinds of things during puberty, and it’s all normal and OK, even if it feels scary.&lt;/p&gt;

I could take the same route with both kids, and open Delilah up to an unknown amount of health risk. Or I could encourage her to be careful with her weight at puberty, which also feels risky for different reasons. My husband wants to just pretend it’s never going to be a problem, and I have no idea where or how to get advice. Lipedema isn’t researched much in the U.S., and her pediatrician told me it was “just obesity by another name” when I asked for guidance. But I’ve seen my mom and sister both have so much pain and distress from it, and I don’t want that for my kid. Where can I get help?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6ja001q3b77oxatgmvh@published"&gt;If only maintaining a low BMI were as easy as being told by your mom, “Be careful with your weight!” and replying with, “OK!” If that were the case, people of all ages wouldn’t be at war with their bodies, and there wouldn’t be a multimillion dollar diet and fitness industry designed to help people, who, despite their best intentions, can’t crack the code of eating and working out in a way that leads to the body size they so badly want. I really want to question the assumption that informing her about the need to keep her weight low would actually lead to her doing so. Beyond that, I worry that putting the idea of restriction into Delilah’s head might backfire and lead to her experiencing shame, or feeling rebellious, and developing an unhealthy relationship with food. (I recently &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/06/advice-family-body-image-comments-food.html"&gt;spoke to a few experts who went into detail&lt;/a&gt; about how dangerous these body image issues can be.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6l9001r3b7760wqcsn4@published"&gt;I appreciate what you’re doing by trying to give both girls healthy messages about food. But I think you should pull back on hitting them over the head with, “Treats are OK! Try to feel confident in your changing body! It’s normal!” Kids pay more attention to what you do than what you say. You don’t have to &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;any particular kind of eating to be a good example. But you could show through your actions that there are more interesting things to focus on than how much healthy or unhealthy food you’ve had, or what your body looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6n6001s3b77usgrhbi9@published"&gt;When it comes to giving direct instructions to Delilah, you could choose a topic like the importance of finding a doctor whom she trusts, refusing to accept being dismissed or having her symptoms minimized, and staying aware that not every medical professional will be well informed about the latest research or thinking surrounding specific conditions. I’m seeing that there are conferences and associations dedicated to sharing information about living with and treating lipedema. Maybe you could invite her to join you, in an age-appropriate way, as you tap into these resources. “You deserve excellent health care from someone who listens to you, and we’re going to stay up to date on the latest research on this condition” is a better message than “Make sure you don’t gain too much weight or you may develop this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbzfd6pr001t3b77dovdause@published"&gt;The other thing that could benefit Delilah is your transparency about the dilemma in your letter. I’m thinking of something like, “I’ve been stressing about telling you how I’ve been advised to keep this condition at bay by maintaining a low BMI without giving you a complex. I want both you and your sister to have a relaxed, pleasant relationship with food and your bodies. How do you think I’ve been doing when it comes to not promoting weird messages about weight? Please let me know.” This could create some distance from the topic and could make her think, “This is exactly what my mom wanted to avoid,” if she notices herself slipping into restrictive habits. It also communicates your actual values: “I want you to be OK in terms of avoiding this debilitating condition, but I also want you to be OK when it comes to your everyday feelings about food and your body.” She can join you on the journey to figure out how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

A few weeks ago, she came to me in tears because she discovered he had spent nearly $1,000 on adult entertainment, leaving them with no money to buy groceries or diapers for the baby, and neither of them was getting paid for two weeks. I purchased what she needed and dropped it off instead of giving her the money to make sure he wouldn’t wouldn’t blow it on more porn. This is not the first time Mandy has come to me in desperation because he’s wasted their money on getting himself off. Unfortunately, she also has two kids with him, both under the age of 4. Trying to convince her to leave him on previous occasions has gone nowhere, but I am hoping this will be a wake-up call for her. Her mother and I talked it over, and we would be prepared to let her and the kids live with us for as long as she needs to if she tells the lout to piss off once and for all. Would making this offer to her be a good idea so she can rebuild her life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 31-year-old woman in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient had a history of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34803-type-1-diabetes-symptoms-treatment-diagnosis.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34803-type-1-diabetes-symptoms-treatment-diagnosis.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mild learning difficulties and end-stage kidney failure. For the last condition, she was receiving &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14618-dialysis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14618-dialysis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dialysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This treatment fills in for the kidneys by clearing waste and excess fluid from the bloodstream, and patients are advised to restrict their fluid and salt intake between sessions. If they don't, fluid can build up in the body because the kidneys aren't filtering it out of the blood, leading to weight gain and strain on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the woman consistently experienced this excessive fluid buildup between appointments, "despite several interventions" aimed at helping her manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;Over time, the patient could no longer tolerate long dialysis sessions, so she would start and end each session above her target weight due to all the fluid buildup. She also reported experiencing occasional constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one dialysis session, a nurse cleaning the chair the woman had been sitting in noted that it felt "rather light." Upon inspection, she noted large chunks of foam — specifically low-density polyurethane foam — were missing from the chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman's medical team discovered this was a case of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22944-pica" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22944-pica" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pica&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which people develop a habit or compulsion to eat non-food items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zNcqUdZVwMvEZ5XXrNxua8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zNcqUdZVwMvEZ5XXrNxua8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to discover that our patient had been eating the foam and had increased her fluid intake with the assumption that it would absorb excess water in the stomach and thus prevent systemic absorption," her doctors &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028043/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3028043/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "This was evidently not the case." In other words, she hoped the foam would act like a sponge and soak up the excess fluid she was retaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pica is sometimes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532242/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532242/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;associated with nutrient deficiencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as a lack of iron or zinc, leading some scientists to theorize that these deficiencies lead to unusual cravings. Alternatively, some think that people with pica may be drawn to the sensations — the tastes, textures or smells — of non-food substances. The condition is sometimes associated with pregnancy or sickle cell anemia, as well as certain mental health disorders and medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the woman’s doctors ran tests and ruled out nutritional deficiencies as a factor. They also didn't uncover any "acute psychosocial triggers for her behaviour," and she had no past history of pica. They suspected that her known learning difficulties may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient was advised about the consequences of eating foam and received regular guidance from a dietitian with a speciality in helping patients with kidney dysfunction. Her family also became more closely involved in her treatment. Other cases of pica are typically treated with behavioral therapies, but the case report didn't note whether any such options were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She additionally received a laxative treatment to help her pass the foam she'd already eaten without any complications. At the time the case report was published in 2010, she was continuing to undergo dialysis three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Cases of pica have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051227699900171" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051227699900171" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been reported among kidney disease patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but they typically involve patients craving and eating clay, dirt, aspirin, flour, baking soda or ice. The effects can range from benign to severe; in the latter case, a person may experience toxic effects, dental problems, bowel obstruction or malnutrition, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman's doctors searched the medical literature for cases of kidney disease patients eating polyurethane foam and didn't find any, but they did find a few cases of people without renal disease eating the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case highlights a recognised but under-diagnosed phenomenon in renal patients, known as pica," the doctors wrote.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have found higher rates of coronary artery disease along America's coastal counties with the highest levels of plastic pollution in the ocean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly 100 million people live along the US coastlines, which include heavily polluted waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are more than 250 coastal counties along the US mainland, which are home to over 94 million people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conduct their study, Ganatra and his team examined 152 US coastal counties along the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Gulf of America (formerly the Gulf of Mexico).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They collected data on microplastic levels in ocean waters within 200 nautical miles of these counties between 2015 and 2020, using information from the National Centers for Environmental Information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers sorted the counties into four groups based on the amount of microplastics in the water: low (almost no plastics), medium (up to one small particle per 200 bathtubs of water), high (a handful of particles per bathtub), and very high (10 or more particles per bathtub).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even in health care – a field devoted to healing – we rely heavily on single-use plastics. Much of it ends up in landfills or the ocean, where it fragments into microplastics and enters the ecosystem,' Ganatra explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then used health data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gathered between 2015 and 2020, to look up the rates of Type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (plaque buildup in the arteries), and stroke in these counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They adjusted for factors like age, gender, income, access to doctors, air pollution, and neighborhood conditions, ensuring the results weren't skewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed a clear pattern: counties with very high microplastic pollution in nearby ocean waters had significantly higher rates of health problems that have been linked to an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(23)00223-1/fulltext"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; has shown that a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis can significantly reduce someone's life expectancy, shaving off more than a decade for people who develop the disease in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The rate of stroke incidents was 9 percent higher in US coastal counties with heavily polluted ocean waters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are plastic fragments less than 5 millimeters in size, while nanoplastics are even smaller, less than 100 nanometers - less than the size of a human hair. Both have been linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, cognitive issues, and reproductive problems&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the World Health Organization, stroke survivors may die between five and 10 years earlier than the average person who never had a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/26/2_suppl/25/5925419"&gt;researchers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; have found that coronary artery disease is linked to a significant drop in life expectancy, with middle-aged adults losing five to eight years of life due to their higher risk for heart attacks and sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/living-near-an-ocean-polluted-by-microplastics-may-increase-cardiometabolic-disease-risk?preview=4be0&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; has its limitations. It only looked at county-level data, not individual people, so it can't prove that microplastics directly cause these health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also didn't measure microplastics in people's bodies or pinpoint exactly how they enter the body, whether through water, food, or the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the study focused on ocean water pollution, not other sources like fish or plants, which come from the sea and have been shown to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14239717/The-10-foods-high-cancer-causing-microplastics-easy-swaps-avoid-them.html"&gt;full of plastic particles as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the drawbacks, Ganatra contended that the results show a clear connection between the world's growing plastic crisis and rising rates of poor health and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study adds to a growing body of evidence that the garbage we discard into the environment often finds its way back to us,' the study's senior author said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also linked microplastic contamination in the human body to conditions like dementia, infertility, eczema, premature aging, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous studies in mice have linked nanoplastics (plastic particles that are even smaller than microplastics) in the brain to cognitive changes, Parkinson's disease, and some types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Keeping a healthy mix of friendly microbes in the gut – known as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26922981/"&gt;eubiosis&lt;/a&gt; – is crucial for good health. When that delicate balance is thrown off – often by antibiotics, diet or illness – the result can be a range of issues, from digestive problems to more serious conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8320851/"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5757125/"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10045203/"&gt;neurological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36270676/"&gt;metabolic&lt;/a&gt; disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One increasingly popular way to try to restore gut health is through &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664618305552"&gt;faecal microbiota transplantation&lt;/a&gt;. This involves taking stool from a healthy person, isolating the beneficial microbes and putting them in a capsule (jokingly referred to as "crapsules" or &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/articles/cpd4wv03gxjo"&gt;"poo pills"&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that the beneficial microbes in the pill will establish themselves in the patient's gut, thereby improving microbial diversity and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faecal transplants have been used to treat a wide array of conditions, including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8192290/"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10019775/"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6835402/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6979041/#:%7E:text=FMT%20Improved%20Insulin%20Resistance%20and,after%208%20weeks%20of%20treatment."&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165029" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/irritable_bowel_642.jpg" alt="woman clenching stomach" class="wp-image-165029 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/irritable_bowel_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/irritable_bowel_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/irritable_bowel_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165029" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Faecal transplants have been used to treat irritable bowel syndrom.

In this case, the problem is that microbes from the donor's large intestine may not be suitable for other parts of the recipient's gut, especially the small intestine, where the microbial makeup is very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this, researchers gave antibiotics to mice to disturb their natural gut microbes, then treated them with faecal transplants. They also tried transplanting microbes specifically from different parts of the small intestine. The mice were monitored for one to three months to track changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wrong microbes in the wrong place&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that faecal transplants often led to regional mismatches – the wrong microbes ending up in the wrong place. This altered the mix and behaviour of the gut microbes in unexpected ways, disrupting energy balance and other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165027" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/microbes_in_gut_642.jpg" alt="illustration of microbes in gut" class="wp-image-165027 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/microbes_in_gut_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/microbes_in_gut_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/microbes_in_gut_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165027" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microbes may not always be at home in different gut environments.

But the researchers are urging doctors to take greater care when using faecal transplants, particularly when it comes to dose, timing and possible side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may, however, be a better way forward. A newer method known as the &lt;a href="https://www.the-microbiologist.com/news/fecal-transplants-promising-treatment-or-potential-health-risk/6012.article#:%7E:text=%E2%80%99Omni%2Dmicrobial%E2%80%99%20approach,metabolomics%20to%20track%20their%20activity."&gt;"omni microbial approach"&lt;/a&gt; involves transferring microbes from all parts of the intestine, not just the colon. This could help recreate a more balanced and natural gut environment, avoiding the local mismatches seen in standard faecal transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also growing interest in techniques that aim to "terraform" the gut: deliberately reshaping specific regions with carefully selected microbes to restore normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research has certainly sparked debate around the safety of faecal transplants. But with alternative approaches already being developed, there is real hope that the benefits of gut-based treatments can still be delivered, without the risks.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258643/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/" target="_blank"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 6% of American adults are currently taking GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic. It was FDA-approved in 2021 for weight loss. While these medications help patients shed significant pounds, many are left with unwanted excess skin that creates both cosmetic and health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media influencer &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/takingmylifebackat42/" target="_blank"&gt;Tonya Spanglo&lt;/a&gt;, who lost 250 pounds, exemplifies this journey. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I was 430 pounds, and I did not stay on the scale long enough to see it go up anymore," Spanglo said about her weight before beginning her transformation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanglo shared that food became her escape mechanism early in life. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He was an alcoholic, and he was an abuser," she revealed about her father, explaining the roots of her complicated relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many others struggling with obesity, Spanglo tried numerous weight loss methods. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I bought Fen-Phen on the black market," she admitted. "I would lose 40 and gain back 50. I always gained back more than I lost."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Spanglo underwent &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-sleeve-surgery/about/pac-20384755" target="_blank"&gt;gastric sleeve surgery&lt;/a&gt; to reduce her stomach size. She had to lose significant weight to prove she could change her lifestyle and qualify for insurance coverage. On the day of surgery, she was 299 pounds. After that, she lost another 100 pounds but eventually regained about 40 pounds. That's when she turned to GLP-1 injections. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I started doing Ozempic, which lots of people that have had weight loss surgery, they do a GLP-1," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic weight loss left Spanglo with significant excess skin that caused physical problems beyond appearance. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The rashes you get, the infections that you get, I would have to put a towel in between my stomach and my body because of the sweat, the smell," she described.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these issues, Spanglo consulted Houston plastic surgeon &lt;a href="https://drrukminirednam.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rukmini Rednam&lt;/a&gt; for a body lift.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's the tummy tuck that goes all the way around," Dr. Rednam explained. "We can easily be removing 20 to 30 pounds in just tissue skin."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure removed loose skin from Spanglo's arms, back, buttocks, and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I also did a breast lift where I didn't want to do implants, but she took the good fat from my stomach, my abdomen area, and put that into my breasts, and lifted my breasts," Spanglo said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rednam noted the growing trend in her own practice.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would tell you almost 20% to 30% of people, if not higher on GLP-1 medications that are coming in for these procedures."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, &lt;a href="https://cdn.theaestheticsociety.org/media/statistics/2023-TheAestheticSocietyStatistics.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the Aesthetic Society reports&lt;/a&gt; that lower body lifts have increased by 43% and upper body lifts by 34% in the first four years since GLP-1 medications began getting approval for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rednam emphasizes that cosmetic surgery involves more than physical changes. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All of my patients get a mental health coach and these are all licensed professionals, they work with their dietitian," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one year after her body lift, Spanglo exercises daily, works to maintain healthy eating habits, and continues using Ozempic to "quiet her food noise." She has transformed her weight loss journey into a career, amassing nearly 2 million followers across &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@takingmylifebackat42?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of GLP-1 medications, Spanglo cautions against viewing them as an effortless solution. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's no magic pill out there. You have to work it," she stressed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

He had a cancer normally associated &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14703051/organs-failing-die-habit-americans-loyda-cordero-galiero.html"&gt;with heavy tobacco use.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet his last chest scan just two years earlier had been completely clear, leading his medical team to believe vaping may have played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the tumor had spread into the tissue surrounding his heart, surgery was ruled out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He began chemotherapy, but the disease progressed rapidly and he died just three months after his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His case, published in the American Journal of Case Reports, is thought to be the first to suggest a possible link between vaping and cancer in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio and Cara Delevingne are among the celebrities known to vape on occasion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier studies had only demonstrated such associations in lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors from AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City, who treated him, wrote: 'While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between e-cigarette use and malignancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of e-cigarettes and their possible role in lung cancer development and progression.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there have been a handful of prior cancer cases involving people who vape, many of those patients were older and had long histories of smoking tobacco, making it difficult to isolate the effects of vaping alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr James Finigan, a pulmonologist who specializes in treating lung nodules and lung cancer, told the Daily Mail: 'Though the long term effects of vaping are still being studied, there is evidence that the risk of cancer is four fold higher in those who have vaped and smoked cigarettes compared to those who have only smoked cigarettes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Jersey patient had quit traditional cigarettes more than a decade earlier before turning to e-cigarettes and was relatively young, with a faster-than-expected clinical decline and no response to chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team wrote: 'While definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, our patient's younger age, limited combustible tobacco smoking history, rapid tumor growth, lack of response to chemotherapy, and accelerated clinical decline raise the possibility of a distinct or more aggressive disease pattern. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These differences prompt consideration of potential contributing factors, including the prolonged use of ENDS [electronic cigarettes].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigarettes produce an aerosol by heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings, and a mixture of toxic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When inhaled, this vapor can deliver harmful substances deep into the lungs, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and other volatile organic compounds known to cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These substances can damage lung tissue and over time, this damage can lead to DNA mutations and inflammation which increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the patient's tumor occupied roughly two-thirds of his left lung by the time it was detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed he had squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) — a form of cancer that accounts for roughly 20 to 30 percent of all lung cancer diagnoses in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are around 226,000 new cases annually, the vast majority of whom are men and long-term smokers.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCC is often considered a 'silent killer' because it may not cause obvious symptoms in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When signs do appear, they are frequently mistaken for less serious conditions — such as allergies, bronchitis, or asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, SCC has a five-year survival rate of around 50 percent. But once it spreads beyond the lungs, that figure drops to just seven percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Jersey patient was initially discharged after diagnosis, with plans to begin treatment on an outpatient basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within two weeks, he returned to the hospital in severe pain. The tumor had grown so large it was compressing his airways and making it difficult to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors inserted a stent to help open his lungs, and he was prescribed radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the cancer continued to spread, and he died within two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors of the report are now calling for more research into the cancer risks associated with e-cigarette use, particularly as more long-term users age into the window when cancer typically appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suggest updating cancer screening criteria to include chronic vapers — especially those with more than 10 years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As for adult vaping, a study in JAMA recently found Oklahoma topped the list &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Early detection in this instance might have facilitated timely intervention and improved the clinical outcome,' the doctors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future research should investigate whether e-cigarette use is an emerging risk factor worth considering in lung cancer screening programs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Finigan added: 'Identifying lung cancer early, either through screening or through appropriately identifying and managing incidentally identified lung nodules, is the most effective way to reduce overall lung cancer mortality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 16 million American adults — about 6.5 percent of the U.S. population — currently use e-cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest rates are seen in young adults aged 18 to 24, with more than 15 percent in that group reporting regular use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among children, about 1.6 million middle and high school students still vape, though usage has declined since its peak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 23:07:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNVUdyZW54emRHOEFZeWx6eGpfWFRMVUEzOEtfRzVvY2JZYlNESlB1eDFLajlVV1QxRlItTEdPS1o5Nng0RV9pZVJrbndlcG1YaUowaERvR1J3MmpLZVY3WlJHR2RaaU1KQUNaNjZYNXl5X2FleXoxcTN2c1hnVXdkc1UyZTk3UVluNi1BbGxlTVZZQnNQNzNrMUJnakM4Z05jcUtqWXhPRUpMZi1PZURrY1poWG1FZlE3M0NIR1FTclNOeGhaRFg4MHZR</guid></item><item><title>在青少年之前接受放疗，脑癌诊断后的化疗- Bring Me The News | Prior Lake teen to undergo radiation, chemo after brain cancer diagnosis - Bring Me The News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNejBmdjRBNTZYLUF6UGk5OGFXWkw4N3JUZEdVNS1SenduU0RSR194S0lnWTlDMnBTUFp5YzVUNWE3LWJ3Wk1nZnhad2szSnp3bFp4eV9KSWEtaVFMcUdCZWFuZ1hrWmtSbjBMYS1kU2dhenozekVERnRWTm95YVloRl9JTUF6dm1PY1pMWnRhM2pDdWxUd1pCMkpOeDNJMG1LQjhXX3NCZ1NnR2s3d1V1OFBTNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 22:33:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNejBmdjRBNTZYLUF6UGk5OGFXWkw4N3JUZEdVNS1SenduU0RSR194S0lnWTlDMnBTUFp5YzVUNWE3LWJ3Wk1nZnhad2szSnp3bFp4eV9KSWEtaVFMcUdCZWFuZ1hrWmtSbjBMYS1kU2dhenozekVERnRWTm95YVloRl9JTUF6dm1PY1pMWnRhM2pDdWxUd1pCMkpOeDNJMG1LQjhXX3NCZ1NnR2s3d1V1OFBTNA</guid></item><item><title>另一项研究发现，杂草对您的心脏有害- Gizmodo | Yet Another Study Finds Weed Is Bad for Your Heart - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNY3VTUmtrNm13aE9BOFo4dEdQYnNwTl9ROFdRc1pSUWNHNlgwMzJhVncxUGhvQ1BJdU5rTGtTRWdXOHdsNnd4bDI0dGhCWXgwb0FYMVp2Qk1WN3E4WXdEbFpGdzNPMGpIR3ZLZVJGM0dPV2NfdllMT09Lbk80SmFmQ0MzWmhLRThk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, weed use among U.S. adults has reached an all-time high. While many laud this drug as safe, natural, and even medicinal, a growing body of evidence suggests it contributes to adverse cardiovascular effects—including deadly heart disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/heartjnl-2024-325429"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Tuesday, June 17, presents new evidence showing that marijuana use doubles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. The researchers found particularly heightened risks of stroke and acute coronary syndrome (ACS)—a sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart, such as a heart attack. While previous studies have linked cannabis to cardiovascular problems, this research underscores the severity of these risks. The authors note, however, that future studies will need to verify this link and investigate the mechanisms behind it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings may come as a shock to those who consider weed a harmless high, but co-author Emilie Jouanjus, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Toulouse in France, was not surprised. She’s been studying the adverse health effects of marijuana for more than a decade and hopes this study will promote better decision-making around marijuana use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think that it’s very important that people realize that there is risk, even if it’s a natural product,” Jouanjus told Gizmodo. Over the last decade, increased state legalization has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/08/cannabis-and-hallucinogen-use-among-adults-remained-at-historic-highs-in-2023"&gt;&lt;span&gt;made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; weed more accessible and less stigmatized, contributing to a rise in recreational and medicinal use. Jouanjus and her colleagues argue that public health messaging should treat cannabis like tobacco—not criminalizing it, but actively highlighting its risks and discouraging use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers analyzed 24 studies, conducted between January 2016 and December 2023, that investigated the link between marijuana use and serious cardiovascular outcomes. These studies involved roughly 200 million participants mostly between the ages of 19 and 59. They specifically looked at cardiovascular disease death and non-fatal outcomes including stroke and ACS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis found that cannabis use increases the risk of ACS by 29%, risk of stroke by 20%, and doubles the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. While the researchers say their study provides an exhaustive analysis of the available data on marijuana use and cardiovascular disease, Jouanjus noted that the included studies were limited by a lack of data on when and how participants were exposed to cannabis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This leaves several important questions unanswered, such as, at what dosage does cannabis become unsafe? Are the cardiovascular risks lower for occasional marijuana users? Is consuming edibles safer than smoking weed? Jouanjus hopes future studies will explore these questions. Some researchers have already begun, like Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at the University of California San Francisco. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Springer co-authored a recent study, published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2025.1399"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in May, that found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/smoking-weed-and-eating-edibles-share-this-surprising-health-risk-2000611136"&gt;&lt;span&gt;both smoking weed and eating edibles increase risk of cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The finding challenges widespread assumptions that edibles are a less-harmful way to consume marijuana and underscores the drug’s alarming cardiovascular effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Jouanjus, Springer wasn’t surprised by the link between cannabis use and cardiovascular disease death. “This is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;consistent with several reports in the last few years showing associations between cannabis use and various kinds of cardiovascular outcomes, as well as another recent meta-analysis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2025/03/17/15/35/Cannabis-Users-Face-Substantially-Higher-Risk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at the [American College of Cardiology] conference in March,” he told Gizmodo in an email. That study found that cannabis users face significantly higher risk of heart attack than non-users. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Springer’s latest study found that cannabis users showed reduced blood vessel dilation, which puts them at greater risk of heart attack and other poor cardiovascular outcomes. In theory, this could contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease death that Jouanjus and her colleagues found, he said, but researchers need more evidence to support that claim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are other potential mechanisms, too. Jouanjus pointed to previous research that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6461323/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that, like tobacco, cannabis contributes to buildup of plaque within artery walls. This increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. She also highlighted that the psychoactive compound in marijuana—tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—is far more concentrated in cannabis products today than those from 20 years ago. This, too, may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular death she observed in her study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While all of these factors could plausibly influence weed’s cardiovascular effects, getting to the bottom of why this drug damages heart health will require more research. In the meantime, Jouanjus feels there is enough evidence to warrant caution and moderation when using marijuana. The public is well aware of the benefits of cannabis, but she hopes her study can draw attention to its risks, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Springer agrees, “These reports over the last few years, including ours and this paper, indicate that cannabis is not necessarily harmless,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

And in those studies where sex was recorded, cannabis users tended to be mostly male and younger than non-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The analysis revealed heightened risks for cannabis use: 29% higher for acute coronary syndrome; 20% higher for stroke; and a doubling in the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

Cannabis is now generally more potent and has diversified into a wide array of inhaled high potency cannabis concentrates, synthetic psychoactive cannabinoids, and edibles, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They wrote: “How these changes affect cardiovascular risk requires clarification, as does the proportion of risk attributable to cannabinoids themselves versus particulate matter, terpenes or other components of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Cannabis needs to be incorporated into the framework for prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease. So too must cardiovascular disease prevention be incorporated into the regulation of cannabis markets.

The rising toll has public-health teams scrambling for fresh combat tools, especially as traditional chemical sprays lose their edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loss stems from two hard truths. First, the very &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7692614/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pyrethroid insecticides&lt;/a&gt; that once worked wonders now linger in soil and water, nudging delicate ecosystems off balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, mosquitoes adapt fast. Larvae soaking in tainted puddles and adults drifting through treated neighborhoods increasingly shrug off doses that once killed them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-repellents-that-actually-work-yes-thanks-to-ai-machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Controlling the pests&lt;/a&gt; at their waterborne stage is vital, yet options that stay potent without harming everything else remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-cbd-and-mosquitoes"&gt;Cannabis, CBD, and mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Insects&lt;/em&gt; points to a solution hiding in plain sight: the hemp plant, &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After air-drying and grinding ordinary hemp leaves, scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; led by Erick Martinez Rodriguez extracted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabidiol (CBD)&lt;/a&gt; and added the concentrate to cups of water teeming with yellow fever mosquito larvae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hours, both a strain that laughs at &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rising-temperatures-could-make-insect-repellents-less-effective/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;common insecticides&lt;/a&gt; and a non-resistant strain were wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world, mainly because as adults they serve as vectors of disease,” Rodriguez explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-resistance-to-vulnerability"&gt;From resistance to vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two important findings jumped out. The first was total mortality: every mosquito larva exposed to sufficient CBD died by the two-day mark, regardless of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-learn-how-mosquitoes-use-sound-to-outsmart-and-evade-human-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;its genetic armor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second was efficiency. While industrial chemicals often push resistance higher with every generation, CBD’s effect cut straight through those defenses. Doses varied, but even modest concentrations proved lethal to all mosquito larvae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you compare the amount of hemp extract needed to kill 50 % of the population to other synthetic conventional insecticides, it is on the high side, but when you compare it side by side to other natural extracts we have tested in our lab, only a relatively low amount is required to produce high mortality values in larvae,” said Martinez Rodriguez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cbd-kills-mosquitoes"&gt;How CBD kills mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical sleuthing showed that CBD dominated the hemp extract, and terpene fractions did little damage on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larvae were judged dead once they stopped moving under a gentle nudge, confirming the cannabinoid’s direct impact on vital systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insects lack the endocannabinoid receptors that give &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-can-help-ease-chronic-pain-anxiety-and-mood-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CBD its wellness reputation&lt;/a&gt; among humans, so the compound must strike different molecular targets – possibly ion channels that govern nerve impulses or enzymes tied to muscle control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the route, CBD skirts the metabolic tricks that shield many larvae from pyrethroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hemp-economics-meet-public-health"&gt;Hemp economics meet public health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp is no niche crop. U.S. farmers planted about 27,680 acres in 2023, and the total value of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hemp products&lt;/a&gt; topped $291 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaves, often left as low-value waste after flowers and seeds are harvested, could become raw material for larvicides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning those leaf cast-offs into mosquito-control pellets would give growers an extra revenue stream while trimming refuse piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crop’s adaptability sweetens the deal. Hemp thrives across a wide climate range, grows quickly, and rarely needs harsh pesticides of its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural communities looking to diversify incomes and urban growers cultivating indoor micro-hemp could both feed a supply chain aimed at vector-control programs from Texas to Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strains-and-waterway-safety"&gt;Strains and waterway safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field trials must still answer hard questions: How long does CBD linger in ponds? Does it bother tadpoles, fish fry, or helpful insects? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early lab work hints at selectivity, yet natural habitats are complex. Regulators will demand data showing that CBD pellets, briquettes, or slow-release films silence mosquito larvae without tipping aquatic ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second layer of testing will match different hemp strains for efficacy. Plants bred for fiber deliver more stalk than cannabinoid, while floral varieties boast &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cannabidiol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;richer CBD profiles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting cultivars that maximize larvicidal punch and minimize unwanted compounds will keep costs down and environmental margins wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-cbd-and-mosquito-control"&gt;Next steps for CBD and mosquito control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists plan to refine dosage, explore formulations that stick to the water’s surface, and probe how CBD interacts with other biocontrol measures like &lt;em&gt;Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis&lt;/em&gt;. Combining modes of action could slow resistance even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams will also map out manufacturing pipelines – picture hemp-leaf extract concentrated at regional facilities, then shipped as shelf-stable granules to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-some-people-are-mosquito-magnets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mosquito-control districts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy makers, meanwhile, need clear guidelines. Approving a botanical larvicide means balancing urgent disease threats against conservation goals. Transparent monitoring and community engagement will help keep public trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-weapon-in-the-mosquito-wars"&gt;Another weapon in the mosquito wars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp-derived CBD will not single-handedly end malaria, dengue, or Zika. Yet the discovery that a familiar wellness compound doubles as a larval assassin widens the playbook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uniting agriculture, chemistry, and entomology, researchers have opened &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-habitats-are-expanding-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a practical path&lt;/a&gt; toward safer mosquito control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If larger-scale tests confirm the promise seen in the lab, those humble hemp leaves could soon guard countless backyard birdbaths, drainage ditches, and rice paddies – one cup of water at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/15/7/517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 21:55:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNcUVKQTh4OTlQNG1VVWFqV3pZYkFDNnp6SE1uZmhMV2dGNUJBam9uOWpBYURJOFhrN3V6di0tSks1YUJvb2tJTU5vcVV0cktjUUgzd1B2RXhHSnFwa2lrbklXNjB3Nk5wSEZvYUprcVdqZzhCOVJWUE1YMVktMVRLYkg3eUpXeEhrdUtGNFcxTkNJTjlKN0RsSzR3</guid></item><item><title>乔治· W ·布什（ George W.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their first all-staff meeting since the start of the Trump administration, the interim leadership of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attempted to sidestep controversy and rally troops at the storied but demoralized agency on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Staff were told CDC director nominee Susan Monarez has begun meeting with senators in advance of a still-unscheduled Senate confirmation hearing. They were also informed the June meeting of the agency’s expert vaccine panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will be shorter than anticipated because the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;eight new members of the committee&lt;/a&gt; — 17 previous members &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-fires-every-member-of-cdc-vaccine-expert-panel-acip/"&gt;were fired last week&lt;/a&gt; by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are not yet in a position to deal with all the agenda items.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were no audible outbursts from staff during the tightly scripted hour-long meeting, which STAT listened to. But an email sent to agency personnel on Monday from CDC’s Office of Safety, Security, and Asset Management suggested there may have been fears the meeting could have been tense. “In advance of tomorrow’s CDC All-Staff meeting, we wanted to provide staff with the following reminders,” it began. Among the reminders was a list of items staff may not bring on CDC campuses that included firearms, mace or pepper sprays, or bladed tools. (STAT has viewed a copy of the email.)&lt;/p&gt;

The alarming projection is that by 2040, the number could skyrocket to 1.4 million, placing immense strain on families, the NHS, and care services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial toll of dementia on Britain was a colossal £42 billion in 2024, and forecasts suggest this cost could more than double to £90 billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this growing crisis, campaigners are urgently calling for investments in early detection tools, which promise inexpensive and swift screening—providing physicians with a vital advantage in combating the onset of severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia claimed 74,261 lives last year, an increase from 69,178 in 2021, confirming its status as the UK's leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fatalities from Alzheimer's on the rise, there's a glimmer of hope among scientists that pinpointing the disease's silent phase might just be the game-changing discovery we've been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 20:14:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE81Y2xiakVjV3MxZ2NRdkFGSFMtTmd0dXlnQmpxdWxuV21iLWdlVGZwYm9EQ1IyQ2xuM0NiSUhHbnFGNDV1VUNseDNtcXVpNFBOZmM4OXhRendtejJIZlpVTnN3anRMQzh2OXBSR2VyV19UTDVmYlZmYTA5aWhrcEXSAYQBQVVfeXFMTzhXZUJpVDRNelVUWVZVMFF6aDRUUmppNHl2TE9KR0ZBOVdBZjlaNFh4RXlIc2J4bDg5STB4cmZTY0gwOFZncVNjV25HMldDT0NRWnJtVEg4VWYtV250TnVFVGtvOExSZ2VoUHVIQjVGOFhrNDdINXlRLUNkVGJfQWd0Z204</guid></item><item><title>最新的Covid变种现在超过三分之一的美国病例- Gizmodo | Latest Covid Variant Now Driving Over a Third of U.S. Cases - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOS3p3dTFfaGRVSmxUeUpoT1BxZTJKS0hXV0VjNm9TNDJrZ1JWaEh2ZDJ5aldkaTVJT3JRWmNpVi1HOXVlRlUzbV9Ub1BUN0xVS2Y2bzBKTXdfMl9oaHVDNV9tVmZWUU0wY3o0anB0anl6X3Y1dVRZU2tHX3NtbElzQ0JYSi1EMFQtNkh6Ujc5bmg5S3AwWHpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The newest concerning variant of covid-19 is rapidly advancing across the U.S. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that NB.1.8.1 has started to supplant other circulating strains of the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC’s latest &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;Nowcast&lt;/a&gt;, covering the last two weeks through June 7, NB.1.8.1 is likely causing 37% of all covid-19 cases in the U.S., just barely behind the current dominant variant, LP.8.1 (38%). It’s an estimate, but the CDC’s numbers indicate a large surge in NB.1.8.1 cases since last month, when officials first detected it in the country. Though not certain, it’s possible that NB.1.8.1 could drive a renewed peak of covid-19 this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization first recognized NB.1.8.1 as a variant worth monitoring in mid-May, though it was initially detected in late January. Since then, it’s become an increasing threat. As of early June, about a quarter of all global cases are thought to be NB.1.8.1, according to &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/circulation?n=c"&gt;WHO data&lt;/a&gt;. Covid-19 activity in general has also been &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt; in some regions of the world, and NB.1.8.1 has been &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-reports-cases-new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-china/"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to recent surges of cases and hospitalizations in parts of Asia, including China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far in the U.S., however, the situation doesn’t seem to be dramatically worsening. The covid-19 test positivity rate as of &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_percent-covid-deaths"&gt;late week&lt;/a&gt; is 3%, just a tick above the previous week. Hospitalizations and deaths related to covid-19 have also &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_positivity-week"&gt;remained&lt;/a&gt; steady and low. And NB.1.8.1 doesn’t seem to cause more severe illness on average than other circulating variants. Today’s variants still belong to the Omicron lineage of the virus, meaning they haven’t substantially changed on a genetic level and updated vaccine boosters are still expected to be effective against NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At the same time, NB.1.8.1 may be just different enough from other strains that it can become the dominant variant moving forward; some early evidence suggests NB.1.8.1 possesses mutations that could increase its transmissibility. This past winter was also unusually quiet for covid-19, with low circulation in the U.S. and elsewhere, but that may set the stage for a larger peak this summer, experts have warned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We do not anticipate the NB.1.8.1 variant to pose a greater public health risk than other Omicron-descendant variants, nor do we expect a significant impact on vaccine effectiveness against severe disease,” said Edoardo Colzani, head of the Respiratory Viruses unit at the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, in a &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/slow-increases-covid-19-observed-across-eueea-new-variant-emerges"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released over the weekend. “However, following a winter with low SARS-CoV-2 circulation, population immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may have partly waned—particularly among older adults and other individuals who are at higher risk of severe disease—potentially increasing vulnerability as virus activity rises.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to vaccination and population immunity, the danger of covid-19 has greatly lowered over time. But this summer could certainly provide an unwelcome reminder of the misery that it can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

The researchers found that college students who reported high levels of pornography use showed altered patterns of brain connectivity while viewing explicit material, heightened physiological and emotional responses, and performed worse on a cognitive control task compared to those who used pornography less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to investigate how repeated exposure to internet pornography might influence brain function and behavior in ways that resemble patterns observed in substance use. While many researchers have speculated that problematic pornography use shares similarities with addiction, the specific neural mechanisms have not been fully understood. This research aimed to bridge that gap using a non-invasive neuroimaging technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fNIRS measures brain activity by tracking changes in blood oxygen levels. It works by shining near-infrared light into the scalp and detecting how much light is absorbed by oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain. These changes reflect neural activity, allowing researchers to monitor how different brain regions function during tasks or stimuli, such as watching videos or solving problems. Unlike MRI, fNIRS is portable, quiet, and allows for more natural behavior during testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen healthy college students who reported low-frequency pornography use and five students who met criteria for problematic pornography use were recruited to participate. All participants were right-handed, heterosexual, and free of any substance use, color blindness, or medical illness. To minimize potential confounds, participants were also instructed to abstain from masturbation during the experimental period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved a sequence of steps. First, participants completed the Stroop Color and Word Test—a common measure of cognitive control and reaction time. Then, they watched a 10-minute internet pornographic video selected for its high view count. During this time, researchers used fNIRS to monitor changes in brain blood flow and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physiological measures, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, were recorded alongside facial expressions using automated software. After watching the video, participants completed the Stroop test again and filled out three psychological questionnaires measuring pornography use, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed notable differences between the two groups. The low-frequency users showed stronger functional connectivity in brain areas related to language processing, movement coordination, and sensory processing, such as Broca’s area, the premotor cortex, and the somatosensory cortex. In contrast, the high-frequency users exhibited greater connectivity in regions tied to executive functions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar areas—regions often implicated in both addiction and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the high-frequency group also demonstrated stronger signs of physiological and emotional arousal. Their facial expressions indicated higher levels of pleasure and happiness, but also greater emotional fluctuation, including signs of anger and sadness. Their parasympathetic nervous system activity was elevated during the video, as reflected in measures like lower heart rate and increased heart rate variability. These changes are similar to patterns seen in individuals using opioid drugs, which are known to produce feelings of euphoria, calm, and blunted awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the pornography, cognitive performance declined in both groups—but the drop was steeper in the high-frequency group. Their accuracy on the Stroop test dropped more sharply, and their reaction times were slower compared to both their own baseline and the low-frequency group. This suggests that pornography exposure may have disrupted their ability to regulate attention and manage conflicting information, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these cognitive effects, the high-frequency group scored significantly higher on questionnaires measuring anxiety and depression. While the study cannot determine whether pornography use causes these symptoms or whether they co-occur for other reasons, the findings echo previous research linking heavy pornography consumption to emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that certain patterns of brain activity observed in the high-frequency group resemble those seen in individuals with substance use disorders and even schizophrenia. Specifically, the increased connectivity in prefrontal areas, combined with altered physiological states and impaired cognitive performance, suggest that frequent pornography consumption may lead to neural and behavioral patterns that mimic other forms of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored how watching pornography affected emotional expression. The low-frequency group showed more diverse and reactive expressions—including surprise, fear, and disgust—while the high-frequency group appeared more emotionally flat, with more vacant or neutral expressions. This finding supports the idea that repeated exposure to explicit content may blunt emotional responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that while psychotherapy remains the most common treatment for problematic pornography use, other interventions have been proposed, including hormone-based medications and drugs typically used to treat obsessive-compulsive behavior. Their findings raise the possibility that treatments developed for substance addiction might also be relevant in managing internet pornography addiction, although this remains a topic of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are some limitations that should be taken into account. The sample size was small, especially in the high-frequency group, which included only five individuals. This limitation may reduce the generalizability of the findings and increases the possibility of random error. Additionally, some of the observed differences in brain connectivity did not remain statistically significant after correcting for false discovery rate, a procedure used to account for the large number of comparisons made in brain imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was recruitment. Due to ethical and practical constraints, it was difficult to find participants with very high levels of pornography consumption who were willing to take part in a laboratory-based experiment. As a result, even the high-frequency group in this study may represent relatively moderate users compared to populations in broader surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effects of internet pornography addiction on brain functional connectivity in the prefrontal lobe exhibit characteristics similar to those of drug addiction,” the researchers concluded. “Moreover, individuals who frequently consume internet pornography report that they experience stronger sexual arousal and heightened pleasure while viewing, which subsequently adversely affects their cognition and emotions. Further research is needed to follow up on these preliminary findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1477914" target="_blank"&gt;The impact of internet pornography addiction on brain function: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Qicheng Shu, Shiyu Tang, Zhenhua Wu, Jiahuan Feng, Wenhao Lv, and Min Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:14:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNdDRVU1FBY3g3Q1RuYnk3UklhSVhvVm43UEpFbGIxaUdTTDc5WWhoTFM2YmJ5VERwTGYxSm1VQ0c1ZkpVdlI4MDhLMExfNEl5NXpSN1RRY1lWTHozekx4M2o1R2hRZkY2RWM5VExSbm8xOWFKc3dYV2QzRjZMNWd2bnpGNjlMWm5sRWZpbXB0VU93RXktSmtkM3FQSEM4VXVRUmYyWGthWjNqazMtWjNlck1xcmJpYjNCeTF5UkVR</guid></item><item><title>有争议的饮料，在减肥方面可能比水更好-每日邮报 | The controversial drink that may be better than water for weight loss - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular diet sodas beloved by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/donald_trump/index.html" id="mol-5792e6d0-4b99-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/taylor_swift/index.html" id="mol-57a92df0-4b99-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c" class=""&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt; are better for you than water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well, at least when it comes to losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, videos have circulated on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-0bff59e0-4ba0-11f0-b20e-293d84c8345c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; claiming the hidden sweetener-infused soda benefit — citing year-long studies that found participants drinking two cans of diet soda a day lost twice as much weight as those drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now nutritionists say there may be some method to the madness, by stating that that anything that can help someone reduce their calorie intake can help with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-6f432830-4ba3-11f0-ab60-0d2cbedb70ba"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may include diet beverages, they said, which could help someone satisfy sugar cravings — reducing snacking on other calorific snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they warn the drinks likely will not lead to long-term weight loss because they do not solve sugar cravings, which can lead someone to re-gain weight after a diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marion Nestle, a top nutritionist at NYU Langone, told the Daily Mail: 'Weight gain is the result of eating more calories than are expended in metabolism and physical activity. Anything that reduce calorie intake, from any source, should help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Neither water nor diet sodas have calories, but diet sodas have chemical sweeteners that might encourage eating more food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Studies on the effects of diet soda are mixed. Water, by definition, is neutral.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Swift is known to be a fan of Diet Coke, and was pictured in advertisements for the drink in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The speculation on diet sodas vs water for weight loss was sparked by a resurfaced 2015 study that suggested sweetener-infused beverages may boost weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper 303 overweight or obese adults — mostly women in their 40s — were split into two groups and asked to follow a particular diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group was asked to drink two cans of diet soda every day, and given coupons for Coca Cola products — including Diet Coke — as well as for Diet Pepsi and Diet Dr Pepper among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the others were asked to consume the equivalent amount of water every day over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also allowed to consume sugar-sweetened beverages and those in the water group could have diet soda too, but had to consume their daily water as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were put through a weight loss program — involving exercise and diet guidance — for 12 weeks and were then monitored for 40 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the study, those who were drinking water had lost 5.4lbs overall but those drinking diet sodas had lost 13.7lbs — or double the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the difference could be down to the sweetened drinks helping reduce cravings for something sweet, helping participants to reduce consumption of sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study had several drawbacks, including that participants were only tracked for a year and it only included people who were already regular diet soda drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a decade later, the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-023-01393-3"&gt;study was repeated&lt;/a&gt; — by another group of researchers at Liverpool University, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like the first, it found those drinking the diet sodas lost 16.5lbs, or about 23 percent more, than those drinking water, who lost 16.5lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Donald Trump is also a fan, and reported to have up to 12 cans of Diet Coke a day. He is pictured above in May this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But unlike the first study, the results were not significant — meaning another factor had a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers had included people who regularly drank diet sodas, but also about one in four participants who did not regularly consume them prior to the trial — a key difference to the previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest this could mean that more people on the water diet did not have strong sweet-food cravings, leading them to consume less food overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hector Perez, a bariatric surgeon in Mexico at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://renewbariatrics.com/"&gt;Renew Bariatrics&lt;/a&gt;, said the studies reflected largely what he saw in his clinic — that diet sodas can help people lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'Research showing that people using artificially sweetened beverages actually lost more weight than those drinking water surprises people, but it lines up with what I see in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For some patients, that familiar sweet taste keeps them compliant. They’re less likely to binge later, less likely to feel deprived, and more likely to stick to the plan.

Anything that reduce calorie intake, from any source, should help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Neither water nor diet sodas have calories, but diet sodas have chemical sweeteners that might encourage eating more food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Studies on the effects of diet soda are mixed. Water, by definition, is neutral.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Swift is known to be a fan of Diet Coke, and was pictured in advertisements for the drink in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The speculation on diet sodas vs water for weight loss was sparked by a resurfaced 2015 study that suggested sweetener-infused beverages may boost weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper 303 overweight or obese adults — mostly women in their 40s — were split into two groups and asked to follow a particular diet for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group was asked to drink two cans of diet soda every day, and given coupons for Coca Cola products — including Diet Coke — as well as for Diet Pepsi and Diet Dr Pepper among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the others were asked to consume the equivalent amount of water every day over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were also allowed to consume sugar-sweetened beverages and those in the water group could have diet soda too, but had to consume their daily water as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were put through a weight loss program — involving exercise and diet guidance — for 12 weeks and were then monitored for 40 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the study, those who were drinking water had lost 5.4lbs overall but those drinking diet sodas had lost 13.7lbs — or double the weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the difference could be down to the sweetened drinks helping reduce cravings for something sweet, helping participants to reduce consumption of sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the study had several drawbacks, including that participants were only tracked for a year and it only included people who were already regular diet soda drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly a decade later, the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-023-01393-3"&gt;study was repeated&lt;/a&gt; — by another group of researchers at Liverpool University, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like the first, it found those drinking the diet sodas lost 16.5lbs, or about 23 percent more, than those drinking water, who lost 16.5lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Donald Trump is also a fan, and reported to have up to 12 cans of Diet Coke a day. He is pictured above in May this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But unlike the first study, the results were not significant — meaning another factor had a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers had included people who regularly drank diet sodas, but also about one in four participants who did not regularly consume them prior to the trial — a key difference to the previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest this could mean that more people on the water diet did not have strong sweet-food cravings, leading them to consume less food overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hector Perez, a bariatric surgeon in Mexico at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://renewbariatrics.com/"&gt;Renew Bariatrics&lt;/a&gt;, said the studies reflected largely what he saw in his clinic — that diet sodas can help people lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: 'Research showing that people using artificially sweetened beverages actually lost more weight than those drinking water surprises people, but it lines up with what I see in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For some patients, that familiar sweet taste keeps them compliant. They’re less likely to binge later, less likely to feel deprived, and more likely to stick to the plan. It’s not about the Diet Coke doing something magical, it’s about it preventing something destructive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he warned it wasn't a magic formula, adding some people who lean on it too heavily become hooked — which can disrupt their long term weight loss progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caroline Susie, a dietitian and spokeswoman at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said that water is still the 'gold standard' for hydration and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she added that, 'When low- or no-calorie sweetened beverages replace higher-calorie drinks, they can help reduce overall energy intake, which supports weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For people who are trying to reduce sugar but still want flavor, sweetener-infused beverages may help them stay on track and avoid higher-calorie alternatives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The jury is still very much out on whether diet sodas could help someone to lose weight (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet sodas have been the focus of mountains of research on whether they can help to boost weight loss, although concrete evidence to back this up has been scant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, researchers have raised concerns over the sweeteners used within them — like aspartame, used in Diet Coke, which has been labeled a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12245725/WHOs-cancer-research-agency-say-aspartame-sweetener-possible-carcinogen-sources.html"&gt;possible carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14805961/Diet-soda-shockingly-linked-devastating-disease-kills-100-000-Americans-year.html"&gt; warned that consuming &lt;/a&gt;the sodas regularly can raise someones risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say this is because the sweetener used, saccharin, can interfere with how the body interprets insulin — raising the risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The science is still very much unclear on whether diet sodas could help someone lose weight more quickly than if they drunk water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization has indicated that much of the data in this area is poor, with trials typically only lasting three months or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some reviews of studies have warned that consuming too much diet soda can have long-term negative health effects, including impaired glucose metabolism and increased risk of comorbidities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And others have found little impact on weight loss from consuming diet soda instead of water — including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35285920/"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 17 studies which found sweetener-infused beverages offered only a 'small improvement' in body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avery Zenker, a registered dietitian for MyHealthTeam in Canada, said: 'Choosing diet soda instead of water could reinforce a preference for sweet flavors, which may affect appetite regulation or lead to seeking out other sweet foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In contrast, water tends to promote a more neutral palate and a natural connection with thirst and hunger cues.

              &lt;p&gt;When it comes to weight loss, surgery still reigns supreme. Research out today shows that people undergoing bariatric surgery tend to lose significantly more weight than people taking the newest, most effective GLP-1 medications for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at New York University conducted the study, which analyzed real-world data from obesity patients. People who received surgery lost five times more weight over a two year span on average than those who were prescribed a GLP-1 drug, they found. The findings also suggest that GLP-1 drugs aren’t as effective in the real world as they are in clinical trials, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the takeaway is when you see a new popular drug come out, you have to take it with a grain of salt. And I think you have to wait a few years for the real world data to come out, because it might temper the results you’re seeing in trials,” senior study researcher Karan Chhabra, a bariatric surgeon and assistant professor of surgery and population health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgery—particularly the sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass—has long been considered the most effective treatment for obesity. People usually lose between 20% and 30% of their baseline weight following surgery, and often experience &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/landmark-study-finds-life-altering-benefits-for-teens-a-decade-after-weight-loss-surgery-2000518382"&gt;long-lasting improvements&lt;/a&gt; in their general health as a result.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in recent years, the emergence of newer GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) has dramatically changed the field of obesity medicine. These drugs are typically more effective (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-fen-phen-risks-1851337644"&gt;and safer&lt;/a&gt;) than past nonsurgical obesity treatments, with people on average losing between 10% and 20% of their weight in clinical trials. And they, too, have been associated with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/people-on-ozempic-are-drinking-way-less-2000600281"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that extend beyond weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first glance, the data had suggested GLP-1 drugs could approach—or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-obesity-drugs-arent-even-here-yet-2000547636"&gt;even surpass&lt;/a&gt;—the effectiveness of bariatric surgery. But according to Chhabra, there hasn’t yet been a rigorous head-to-head comparison of these two different types of obesity treatments among real-world patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chhabra and his colleagues examined the anonymous medical records of over 50,000 people who received surgery (either a sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) or GLP-1 therapy (either semaglutide or tirzepatide) through NYU Langone Health or NYC Health + Hospitals between 2018 and 2024. The researchers adjusted for factors like age, starting BMI, and other health conditions to make the two groups comparable. The patients and their weight loss outcomes were tracked for two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, surgical patients lost 58 pounds (around 24% of their total weight) by the end of year two, whereas GLP-1 patients on average lost 12 pounds (around 4.7% of their total weight)—a fivefold difference. The results were slightly better for people who stayed on their medications for a full year (7% weight loss) and for those who took tirzepatide, the newest and most effective GLP-1 drug available (8% to 9%). But the outcomes still fell well short of the success seen with surgery—not to mention the results from earlier clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550728925001881"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; this week at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are likely several reasons why these drugs aren’t as successful as they’ve appeared to be in trials, Chhabra noted. As many as 70% of GLP-1 patients discontinue use by the first year, for instance. Some will quit because the side effects, typically gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea, are too much to bear; others may stop simply because they can’t afford the drugs any longer (GLP-1 medications often aren’t covered by insurance and can cost upwards of $1,000 a month without coverage). Many of the GLP-1 patients in their study also never reached the maximum dose.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chhabra also suspects that many people in the real world aren’t getting the supportive care and follow-up they would get from doctors in a clinical trial. GLP-1 drugs have fueled a growing telemedicine industry—for instance, one in which people are often prescribed the medications remotely by medical professionals they’ll never interact with personally. (Until recently, people could also easily get compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide, with even less assurance of safety or effectiveness.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t saying that people with obesity shouldn’t take GLP-1 drugs, nor that bariatric surgery is the ideal option for everyone. Some people might prefer a one-time treatment, for instance, or may not have the insurance or resources needed to cover long-term GLP-1 therapy. Others may be nervous about going through with any invasive procedure or have other pre-existing conditions that could complicate surgery but not GLP-1 therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, people will need to be aware of these treatments’ respective pros and cons, and those who choose to go with GLP-1s should manage their expectations, according to Chhabra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They have to know that, at least as of now in the real world, their weight loss is not going to be what we’re seeing with surgery and they also have to know that it’s a lifelong treatment,” he said. “We don’t yet have any protocols for people to maintain weight loss once they’ve stopped medications so it’s important for people to just acknowledge those realities. And I worry that a lot of people are starting medications without really knowing what they’re getting into.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team next plans to sift through more data to figure out exactly why real-life patients on GLP-1 therapy aren’t losing as much weight as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

But I’m more optimistic than ever about fighting the disease - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxONVZaQUlYb09DM0xGdWJTd1dvU0NtX1ZHWkJOSnhpXzh6a2hUckhiYmFFWDNmakxGUnBBZXBkUExlWXh4akhrdDY0UVhuNl82VTB1LWplLVVvdVpNMzZ0ODBZZnprTExBdjZWY0Fzb1EzeGdPUVhDQnFvZEFNZEp4a2J2Sll2YS1lcXNEeDUwWHBsR2YwYlNnWTBlcUlMcWZzOVQ5MElyOVJsTmU4SlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father’s Day without my dad never gets easier. Although he is on my mind every day, I always find myself thinking about him even more often this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My dad was a giant in every sense of the word. More than anyone else, he shaped the values of the Gates Foundation, and everything we have accomplished is a testament to his vision of a better world. Sadly, we lost my dad in 2020 to Alzheimer’s disease. Watching my brilliant, loving father go downhill and disappear was a brutal experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the years since his passing, I’ve met far too many people who had similar experiences with their own loved ones. More than &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;7 million people in the United States&lt;/a&gt; are currently living with Alzheimer’s disease. That means about 1 out of every 9 people over the age of 65 have it. As life expectancies continue to go up, those numbers will only increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the good news: We are making massive progress in the fight against Alzheimer’s and related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I saw some of the reasons for optimism firsthand during a visit to Indiana in 2024. I met with the team at Indiana University’s School of Medicine in Indianapolis — where they have an incredible center that is doing lots of leading-edge neuroscience — and took a super cool tour of their biomarker labs. I also got the opportunity to look under the hood of new automated machines that will soon be running diagnostics around the world. It’s an exciting time in a challenging space.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During my visit, I learned more about the latest big breakthrough in Alzheimer’s R&amp;amp;D: blood-based diagnostic tests. A number of different companies have approaches in the pipeline, but each of them works in roughly the same way, by detecting the ratio of amyloid plaques in the brain. I’m optimistic that these tests will be a game-changer. Here in the U.S., this work reached a huge milestone in May: &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/alzheimers-fujirebio-fda-approval/"&gt;The FDA approved the first blood-based test for patients 55 years and older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the only way to confirm a suspected Alzheimer’s diagnosis was to get either a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003827.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557553/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spinal tap&lt;/a&gt;. Neither is the kind of test a doctor would order unless you were showing clear signs of decline. But catching Alzheimer’s early is key. We now know that the disease begins 15 to  20 years before you start to see any signs. A simple, accurate, and easy-to-run blood test might one day make routine screening possible, identifying patients long before they experience cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I talk people about the promise of these new diagnostics, I’m often asked, “What is the point of getting diagnosed if I can’t do anything about it?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question— but soon it will be moot. The FDA has approved two drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. Both have proven to modestly slow down the progression of the disease, but what I’m really excited about is their potential when paired with an early diagnostic. My main takeaway from my visit to Indiana is that these treatments could be drastically more impactful than I initially thought when given early in the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/trial/302480" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are underway now to prove just how transformative these drugs are for people with presymptomatic Alzheimer’s, and we could see results as soon as 2026. Until then, the drugs will continue to help patients who are already showing cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m also optimistic that researchers will continue to improve current treatments and develop new drugs. This will require running lots of clinical trials. Without a simple diagnostic test, it is often difficult to find enough eligible patients. In some cases, it takes even take longer to enroll participants — as long as three years! — than to conduct the study. My hope is that the new blood tests will get the recruitment time down to less than a year and accelerate the development of new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;All of this progress hinges, of course, on continued funding for Alzheimer’s research. Some of the biggest breakthroughs to date were supported by federal grants, like the discovery of the connection between amyloid proteins and the disease. This isn’t unusual: Medical R&amp;amp;D often relies on government funding to support projects that explore foundational science or aren’t commercially viable yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are on the cusp of turning the tide against dementia — which makes this an especially bad time to pull back on research. Recent cuts to the National Institutes of Health and other government institutions threaten to stop progress in its tracks, and no individual or private organization can fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the moment to spend &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money on research, not less. Right now, all over the world, researchers are collecting data about Alzheimer’s disease. New tools are making it easier for them to share information and work together. As a result, the quest to stop Alzheimer’s has never had more momentum. For my part, I worked with a coalition of partners to create the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://grip-research.org/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Global Research and Imaging Platform&lt;/a&gt;, and I am proud to support organizations like the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation’s Diagnostics Accelerator and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/partthecloud/overview.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Part the Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. All of these efforts simplify how researchers and data scientists work together to share data and develop algorithms and tools in order to make advances in the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is still a huge amount of work to be done — like deepening our understanding of the disease’s pathology and developing even better diagnostics. But I am blown away by how much we have learned about Alzheimer’s over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we lost my dad, an Alzheimer’s diagnosis was a death sentence. Just five years later, that is finally starting to change. I cannot help but be filled with a sense of hope when I think of all the progress being made on Alzheimer’s, even with so many challenges happening around the world. We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Medical professionals across multiple disciplines also advocate for a balanced and nutritious &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/a64540833/is-carnivore-diet-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; to maintain your overall health. But sometimes even your favorite foods can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food we eat is packed with different nutrients that impact our bodies in their own ways. When you take medication and eat certain foods, they can interact negatively and affect the efficacy of your medication or induce unpleasant side effects. And some of the most common culprits are ingredients you may already have in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consulted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,&lt;/a&gt; MBBS, PhD, MRCGP FFSEM, a dual board-certified Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician and Chief Medical and Innovation Officer at &lt;a href="https://www.nuritas.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nuritas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nuritas&lt;/a&gt;, to break down some of the most common foods that can interact with medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, a disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive list of ingredients or a substitute for medical advice from your own healthcare team. When you start taking a new medication, we suggest you consult your doctor or pharmacist about what foods to look out for and how to adjust your diet accordingly. Depending on the medication and your own individual care plan, those adjustments can range from avoiding a food entirely to reducing your intake to carefully timing the consumption of your food with your doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;R.Tsubin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you take prescription medication, you may need to put down your &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paloma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;paloma&lt;/a&gt;. Grapefruit, as well as its juice, is a common ingredient that interacts with a wide range of prescriptions. “Grapefruit inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 in the liver and intestines, which metabolizes many drugs,” Franklyn-Miller says. “This can lead to higher drug concentrations in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this enzyme, your medications will accumulate and linger in your bloodstream, which can increase your risk of side effects. Grapefruit causes interactions across several drug categories, including statins, calcium channel blockers, and immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Jose A. Bernat Bacete - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium has long been heralded as an essential mineral, but it may have less than ideal effects if you take certain antibiotics. “Calcium-rich foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt can bind to antibiotics such as tetracycline and fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, forming insoluble complexes that reduce drug absorption in the gut,” Franklyn-Miller says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for any foods supplemented with calcium, like certain varieties of orange juice and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a65059238/is-almond-milk-or-oat-milk-healthier/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:many almond milks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;many almond milks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Crispin la valiente - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general rule of thumb is that darker greens have more nutrient density. One of the most common nutrients is vitamin K, which plays an essential role in blood clotting and bone health. But if you take certain anticoagulant blood pressure medications, vitamin K is more harmful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods like spinach, kale, and broccoli, high in vitamin K, can counteract the effects of anticoagulants like warfarin, which relies on inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors to prevent blood clots,” says Franklyn-Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Oscar Wong - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals warn about the adverse health effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, which is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond increasing your risk of cancer and organ damage in the long term, alcohol also can have a significant impact on your prescription medications in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alcohol can amplify or diminish the effects of medications,” Franklyn-Miller says. “For instance, it enhances the sedative effects of benzodiazepines like diazepam and increases the risk of liver toxicity when combined with acetaminophen.” Alcohol also greatly increases the sedative effects of melatonin, which is why Franklyn-Miller suggests the use of other natural peptides as alternative sleep aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aged, Cured, &amp;amp; Fermented Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;LauriPatterson - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the oldest and most prevalent food preservation techniques, like aging, curing, and fermenting, lead to the development of the amino acid tyramine. Tyramine can be found in large quantities in foods like cheese, soy sauce, sauerkraut, sausages, and different types of alcohol. It’s a natural byproduct of these preservation processes, but tyramine also interacts with particular medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franklyn-Miller says tyramine-rich foods “can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), used for depression or Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again: this list isn't comprehensive, nor is it meant to replace guidance from your doctor or medical team. If you have any questions or concerns about how your medications may interact with certain foods, always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:02:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5KUjdubVlMR3FUNW1Ld3h2RUFqUHJWTFBpU29vUnZ4Q0RzQmp3X0FKUldBeGxOSlZydG9yREhHbkNKWi1XNlBLNGJHRWw5T3ZXcEhMQUNTZ1hPa1c1U19hS0VlTG9FdWdLUVZwM3hHcXE</guid></item><item><title>什么是代谢综合征–我们真的需要担心吗？ -卫报 | What is metabolic syndrome – and do we really need to worry about it? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQR09CZ190emJTZk5NcHo2Ql84WGk3aE5kWDg1OHBpX3dOdVdNbVVZVEVSUTltOEZ0ajZVYk1rU0NFTjd5Nzc1YVNWMHVLRVhWRFVEOU5MTTJnUnB5czQyLXNBME9wNWR3enhMdm9ScERuenIzeU1Ia1g5amctNlViNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;etabolic syndrome is trending online.

Some content creators do relay accurate information about it, but messaging can take a turn toward scienceploitation, or the use of scientific language to sell untested products and diet plans, says &lt;a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/law/faculty-and-research/health-law-institute/people/timothycaulfield.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Tim Caulfield&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and research director of the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta.

Here’s what doctors and scientists say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Metabolic syndrome refers to having multiple conditions that increase the risk of health problems like diabetes, stroke and heart disease. These conditions include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abdominal obesity, high blood triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, also known as the “good cholesterol.” According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, having &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three or more&lt;/a&gt; of those conditions means you may have metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When you combine these conditions, you develop metabolic syndrome,” explains Dr Blanca Lizaola-Mayo, a quadruple board-certified physician, the Medical Director of the Transplant Hepatology Center and the co-founder of the Metabolic Liver Clinic at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many people with metabolic syndrome also have &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it harder for cells to absorb glucose, raising blood sugar levels and increasing the risk of related health problems. Insulin is one of several hormones that help regulate metabolism. Factors like poor diet and chronic stress can dysregulate these hormones, contributing to metabolic syndrome, explains Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sometimes, content creators use the phrase “metabolic dysfunction” instead. These terms are being used online to describe a similar phenomenon, says Lizaola-Mayo. But “metabolic syndrome” refers to specific medical conditions, as described above. Meanwhile, there is no &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35785479/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unified definition of “metabolic dysfunction”&lt;/a&gt;, but it refers more generally to the metabolism not functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; American adults has metabolic syndrome. In the UK, the estimate is &lt;a href="https://www.heartuk.org.uk/genetic-conditions/metabolic-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in four&lt;/a&gt; adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the risk of metabolic syndrome &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome/causes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; with age, incidence is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pmj/article/99/1175/985/7076129" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising&lt;/a&gt; overall. This prevalence may be partly explained by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8595506/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/should-i-worry-about-how-long-i-spend-sitting-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt; among adults, along with the proliferation of highly processed foods and food additives that can &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; inflammation, says Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-mitochondria" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are mitochondria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria are cell parts that convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for cellular processes. To have good health, we need our mitochondria to produce energy efficiently and communicate well, says &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Martin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor and doctor of the Mitochondrial Psychobiology Group at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People with metabolic syndrome may have some signs of reduced mitochondrial function, says &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/research-professors/matthew-j-rossman" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Matt Rossman&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant research professor in integrative physiology at the University of Colorado, Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-mitochondrial-dysfunction" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is mitochondrial dysfunction?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In this context, the term “dysfunction” does not mean that mitochondria are broken or damaged, though &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dhru.purohit/video/7368516938818948394?q=mitochondrial%20dysfunciton&amp;amp;t=1748627444850" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that phrasing is sometimes misused&lt;/a&gt; online and in wellness spaces. “You can have metabolic syndrome without having defective mitochondria,” Picard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The term “mitochondrial dysfunction” doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong with the mitochondria, but suggests they aren’t working as efficiently as they should, says Jerry Chipuk, a professor of oncological sciences and dermatology, as well as the founder and director of the Mitochondrial Analysis Facility, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sanna Darvish, a PhD student candidate at CU Boulder, says “mitochondrial dysfunction” can be a vague term, but in her and Rossman’s research, it’s related to a process that results in oxidative stress. This is linked to ageing and health issues, like metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although a person with metabolic syndrome may have less efficient mitochondria, this is distinct from a mitochondrial disease, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3786640/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a very rare condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The signs of metabolic syndrome are the underlying conditions mentioned above, like high blood sugar and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But it can also be a “silent disease”, explains Lizaola-Mayo. For example, metabolic syndrome increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and many diagnosed individuals “have been diabetic for years without realizing it”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some subtle changes may indicate a decline in metabolic health, she says, including frequent headaches, blurry vision, excessive thirst and increased urination. Unusual tiredness and weakness can also indicate an issue. Medical providers use blood pressure and blood tests to &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;diagnose&lt;/a&gt; metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Genetic and environmental factors influence the development of metabolic syndrome. The latter is what we can control, says Lizaola-Mayo, but it can be challenging to eat well and exercise consistently. Time and costs are significant obstacles, and marketing can &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022242920944384" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trick consumers&lt;/a&gt; into thinking some food products are healthier than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The best meal plans and exercise routines are the ones you enjoy, she says, because those are the ones you’ll stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The reality is that we don’t need to diet,” she says. “We need to change our nutrition for good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1 medications can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/may/17/weight-loss-drugs-altering-views-how-body-brain-work" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;help patients&lt;/a&gt; whose metabolic syndrome has progressed to type 2 diabetes. Still, these medications need to be used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications to achieve long-term benefits, says Lizaola-Mayo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Preventive care, including blood work and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/routine-screenings" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;routine screenings&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the best ways to avoid future illnesses. If you’re concerned about metabolic syndrome, seek a regular checkup with your primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-keep-mitochondria-healthy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you keep mitochondria healthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondria rely on various nutrients to make ATP, Chipuk explains, so a balanced diet is ideal, he says. But a very carbohydrate-heavy or high-sugar diet can erode mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise has a “profound effect” on mitochondria, says Rossman, increasing the number of mitochondria and supporting their ability to consume oxygen and produce ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/obesity-disrupts-mitochondria-reduces-fat-burning" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest obesity can make mitochondria less effective, Chipuk cautions that not all forms of weight loss are healthy. He emphasizes it’s “more about strengthening the body than simply eliminating extra pounds”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Activities like chronic smoking and drinking alcohol can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231714001104" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mitochondrial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;. Stress also impedes mitochondria, Chipuk says. Meanwhile, positive life experiences seem to be associated with &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1321881111" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;healthier mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, says Picard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-supplements" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11393155/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; on mitochondrial health supplements is ongoing. But in most cases, there’s not enough valid medical information to support the use of supplements for metabolic syndrome, says Lizaola-Mayo. More large randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if they can provide clinically meaningful benefits, says Rossman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s essential to be very careful with supplements,” says Lizaola-Mayo. “You can achieve more with exercise and a simple, healthy diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Picard also finds supplements “overrated” and doesn’t see them as the way forward for mitochondrial health, instead emphasizing the medical benefits of exercise and nutrition.

But beware “grifters exploiting genuine problems with the health care system and using scientific language to sell their products”, says Caufield.

However, it has not yet been confirmed in Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subvariant of Omicron, called "Nimbus" (NB.181) by researchers, has seen a sharp rise in cases in some states, and now accounts for an estimated 37 percent of cases nationwide, according to &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; collected over two weeks starting on June 7. The ominous nickname emerged after some patients described a sore throat with pain similar to their throat being lined with shards of glass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CDC data for Pennsylvania indicates that nearly 100 percent of all coronavirus cases in the agency's Pennsylvania region are the LP.8.1 subvariant of Omicron. That CDC region also covers Delaware, Washington D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia; the New Jersey and New York region also has not yet confirmed a case of Nimbus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the most recently available CDC data for Pennsylvania is through May 10, and much of the spread of Nimbus in other parts of the country has occurred since then. In California, it's already the dominant strain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health no longer publicly tracks specific details on subvariants the same way they did in the height of the pandemic. A spokesperson acknowledged to Patch that cases were rising nationally but confirmed that there have not yet been any reported in Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Department does not have any case counts related to the COVID-19 Nimbus subvariant," a spokesperson for the department told Patch, "As mandatory reporting requirements for COVID-19 ended in Pennsylvania upon the conclusion of the national Public Health Emergency on May 11, 2023."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to know about the Nimbus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What sets NB.1.8.1 apart is how quickly it spreads,” &lt;a href="https://healthmatters.nyp.org/what-to-know-about-the-new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-known-as-nimbus-and-how-to-protect-yourself-this-summer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;said Dr. Magdalena Sobieszczyk&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the new subvariants can pose severe symptoms, patients sickened are less likely to be hospitalized, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious disease expert, told the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-16/covid-razor-blade-throat-emerges-as-new-subvariant-spreads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;.

Now, the CDC does not offer guidance on whether pregnant women should get a COVID vaccine. The guidance also asks parents to consult a doctor before getting their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is a known vaccine skeptic, also shook up the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on June 11, drawing criticism from many in the public health and medical communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy announced eight new members to serve on the committee after removing all 17 of the previous members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts have also noted that multiple new committee members appointed on June 11 &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-malone-cdc-vaccine-committee.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;have voiced anti-vaccine views&lt;/a&gt;that are not evidence-based.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan’s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he’s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,” he said. Most people on the current list “don’t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 16:11:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNR3RwTWYwT1dVWHRMVDQ0T1hWWlducTN6b1ZyV1BZcmtNanZTWFc2TEpLMDhKVDdZS0xZdGY0MUp3Qnk4dWFiQUw5alAxdDljdGZkRDhEV0pWWWFoTXZBaV9kYW13bGpVWkJzYlVnYzdQbGpsbm4tOXBkYkw1SnZQbzQwYnZnMEtTVTY1X2t5bWEydlNaRGhidU9Fb0FwQdIBtwFBVV95cUxPbGNpZGk5TFYxTTNBdWpOakVGTmJnRXlDSjFKNGxUMEdMc3hJSXp2ZjR0ZU93Wll1TWVzUHNLNTNQVGRtSUZ2T09Oc3J1Nng5aGw4S19DZTNlSUk2SmM3Q2xqWkktRS1vLU1QRUlWU2VwZDF1cF9QaGZOS0pYbFc2SkxCSDB2NjVkUW5TaXV6SGJ2ejNreTA3YUJJR2UtdWtXc0ZqREJqTFZ3M19WV3FxdGVfTklKQ1U</guid></item><item><title>“不健康”的植物性饮食可能会显著增加心脏病风险-今日医学新闻 | 'Unhealthy' plant-based diets may significantly raise heart disease risk - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbmpJTWNQNHFWSlRjbjJlYVhlbmpaYlo4SmVQcXBYMTducm8yVGQzYkM5OUpHNUJTSUp6YlpWUG85UmxpZGVsbzNtWi1HU3kybmxhS0ZVTGM3ek5kaWwzTDNxN2I4NjV0bEFyVW94YnpqVkRCMnhUdWVWV1lxYXJ4cG9ZemwwMHJqZGxCN0lDMzREOGJnNTgtQ0pvbjI1cndER3M5cDR2SkpwTEJEN3U4Yl9R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A person holding a plant-based chicken burger between their hands" class="css-etv4j0"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Funhealthy-plant-based-diets-may-significantly-raise-heart-disease-risk&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Fplant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Heart%20attack%3A%20Unhealthy%20plant-based%20diet%20may%20increase%20risk%20by%2065%25" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/plant-based-chicken-burger-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Not all plant-based meat alternatives are considered healthy. Anastasiya Mihailovna/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study finds that while many plant-based foods are healthy for the heart, many are not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study concluded that eating a diet high in unhealthy plant-based foods was associated with a higher level of a key heart attack biomarker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant-based meat substitutes can be high in sodium and heavily processed, both of which are unhealthy for the heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study confirms that healthy plant-based foods can be beneficial for the heart. However, not all plant-based foods qualify as healthy, and the study finds that those foods can be just as damaging to the heart as their non-plant-based counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study assessed associations between plant diets of various qualities and a trio of critical cardiac biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people who choose not to eat animal-based foods for moral reasons, the potential health benefits of a plant-based diet may be considered a happy byproduct or even a reward. The study suggests that this is not necessarily incorrect, as long as one considers that the rules that apply to healthy eating in general also apply to plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During interviews taken throughout the NHANES survey, participants reported their food intake for a previous 24-hour period, as blood samples were taken to measure the relevant biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study’s biomarkers of concern were cardiac troponin T, cardiac troponin I, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Troponins are indicators of cardiac muscle damage, which is a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151444/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;myocardial infarction or heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. The peptide is associated with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/67/1/124/6032254?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Up to 50%&lt;/a&gt; of individuals with no apparent history of cardiac issues have subclinical levels of troponins. While these levels are not of immediate concern, they may be interpreted as a warning sign of potential future issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/arsuserfiles/80400530/pdf/mped/mped2_doc.Pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MyPyramid Equivalents 2.0&lt;/a&gt; database to sort each reported food into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;healthy plant-based food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unhealthy plant-based food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;animal-based food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that adherence to a healthy plant-based diet was associated with a 49% lower likelihood of having elevated levels of cardiac troponin I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People following an unhealthy plant-based diet had a 65% greater chance of elevated levels of cardiac troponin I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study found no strong association with either healthy or unhealthy plant-based foods and cardiac troponin T or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plant-based foods are not automatically healthier than their animal-product-based counterparts,” said &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, who is a registered dietitian specializing in heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While many plant-based diets can reduce cardiovascular risk due to their nutritional profile, such as being low in saturated fat, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325728/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high in potassium&lt;/a&gt;, magnesium, calcium, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, not all plant-based foods share these benefits,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.joinmidi.com/team/jayne-morgan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/a&gt;, cardiologist at Hello Heart, pointed out that “meat substitutes are frequent unhealthy culprits hidden within plant-based diets, and can actually be quite high in sodium, additives, and saturated fats, often from coconut oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Coconut oil or palm oil are often added for texture. These are high in saturated fat, which may raise LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol and contribute to heart disease risk. In fact, some plant-based burgers can actually have the similar amounts of saturated fat (6-8 grams) as a beef patty,” Morgan said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein noted that these saturated fats can potentially promote insulin resistance as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much salt is in plant-based meat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further, many plant-based meats are heavily seasoned to mimic meat flavors. This often means very high sodium levels, which is a major contributor to hypertension. A plain chicken breast might have 70 mg of sodium [in four ounces of chicken], while a processed plant burger could have 400–600 mg of sodium!”&lt;br&gt;— Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some plant-based substitutes may be highly processed,” Routhenstein said, “and include ingredients that can actually harm &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-improve-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. This applies regardless of whether the food is plant- or animal-based.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The level of processing is a critical factor in determining how healthy they are for your heart,” cautioned Morgan. “When it comes to heart health, it’s not just about what you eat, but also how processed the food is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottom line, highly processed foods — whether plant-based or animal-based — tend to be worse for heart health than whole or minimally processed foods.”&lt;br&gt;— Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing may include additives such as methylcelluose, modified starches, carrageenan, and gums that may trigger inflammation or gut issues impacting the microbiome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing also takes away beneficial components of natural foods such as isolated proteins, diminishing the nutritional profile of whole food sources such as lentils or beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal,” stated Morgan, “is to always maximize nutrients that protect the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to replace animal proteins, Routhenstein said to “look for foods low in saturated fat and sodium, with minimal additives and preservatives. Choose whole food ingredients that are rich in protein, fiber, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/phytonutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;phytonutrients&lt;/a&gt; to meet your goals — such as beans, legumes, tofu, and tempeh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To avoid processed foods, “Be on the alert for long ingredient lists full of additives or ‘natural flavorings.’ In fact, the word ‘natural’ is often a red flag,” &lt;strong&gt;Morgan warned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Choose unsalted or lightly salted options whenever possible. Seek recognizable foods, i.e., whole foods — and remember that fiber helps to lower cholesterol. Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans are good options. Look for oils such as olive, avocado, or canola. Avoid coconut or palm oils, saturated fats, sodium, and additives.”&lt;br&gt;— Jayne Morgan, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:58:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbmpJTWNQNHFWSlRjbjJlYVhlbmpaYlo4SmVQcXBYMTducm8yVGQzYkM5OUpHNUJTSUp6YlpWUG85UmxpZGVsbzNtWi1HU3kybmxhS0ZVTGM3ek5kaWwzTDNxN2I4NjV0bEFyVW94YnpqVkRCMnhUdWVWV1lxYXJ4cG9ZemwwMHJqZGxCN0lDMzREOGJnNTgtQ0pvbjI1cndER3M5cDR2SkpwTEJEN3U4Yl9R</guid></item><item><title>旅行急救箱中的物品：要包括的关键项目-《纽约时报》 | What to Put in a Travel First-Aid Kit: Key Items to Include - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE95Sy1WVk9zaXNKeS11MWp3bVdMeTNiT2RZQnlXV2I0dEkxREsza0x5NlRKYTlBS0dVVjNRcFA4YkFKQU5xZi0xc01IT0dGT3RyOTl6dlltUTRYNVQtdmRLVEJQcURCTGc3VnVrQXR1RTdpQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:39:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE95Sy1WVk9zaXNKeS11MWp3bVdMeTNiT2RZQnlXV2I0dEkxREsza0x5NlRKYTlBS0dVVjNRcFA4YkFKQU5xZi0xc01IT0dGT3RyOTl6dlltUTRYNVQtdmRLVEJQcURCTGc3VnVrQXR1RTdpQQ</guid></item><item><title>MS发病年龄与长期身心健康相关：研究-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | Age at MS onset linked to long-term physical, mental health: Study - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPeWhmR080bUxyTHRTamtaTVNUVEJJU0xsTDl5TFZvbmtseFhqTU9uRkV4TlAwZHFmMG4tQm56RnVtNERtR3owUE45LXlndWR4Vnc0UHNQVzlIekxGRDlNTUJnRy1iYWcwTFdJei1yRUlfOWRoOERWQkctS3ZER3JYLUYzNWRsajk5dmt0bnF4a0FBN1N2MFF3eXpVQU5qSHBNNHlneE1CZ3JuOERCbXF4OTdpMHUwX2xiVVhQNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who develop &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) at a younger age tend to consistently have better physical health but worse mental health than those diagnosed later, a study found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While physical health declined in the long term for all age groups, and mental health increased, the differences between groups were sustained over time, which the researchers said highlighted the need for age-tailored care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to determine what kind of mental health support may maximize quality of life in people with younger age of onset, and which specific aspects of physical health may be targeted to improve quality of life in those with older onset disease, they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211034825003037"&gt;Age of multiple sclerosis symptom onset affects mental and physical health-related quality of life in opposite directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing damage. This results in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as blurred vision, fatigue, and difficulty walking — all of which pose limitations in daily life and take a toll on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MS onset and disability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MS usually begins in adulthood, it can develop before age 18, in which case it is called &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/#Rare_Forms"&gt;pediatric-onset MS&lt;/a&gt; (POMS). Some studies have suggested that people with pediatric-onset disease may develop physical disability when they are several years younger than those who develop the disease in adulthood, but evidence to date has been mixed. It’s also not clear how the age at MS onset affects mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, a team of researchers in Canada examined data from 699 patients who were followed over time as part of the Canadian Prospective Cohort Study to Understand Progression in Multiple Sclerosis (&lt;a href="https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-021-02447-7"&gt;CanProCo&lt;/a&gt;), which is &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/04/11/1m-invested-canadian-study-effects-childhood-onset-ms-over-time/"&gt;funded&lt;/a&gt; in part by &lt;a href="https://www.biogen.ca/"&gt;Biogen Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rochecanada.com/"&gt;Roche Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://braincanada.ca/"&gt;Brain Canada Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at how the age at which someone first experiences &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; affects their health-related quality of life — both physically and mentally — as they live with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of participants had &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (93%), and the rest had &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. The average age at symptom onset was 33.2, with 16.9% having symptoms before age 25 and 2.3% having POMS. At the time of the analysis, they had been living with the disease for a mean of 4.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that patients who developed MS at a younger age tended to report better physical health than those with a later onset. Physical health was measured using the MS Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54), where higher scores mean better health. For every five-year increase in age of onset, scores decreased by 1.5 points, which is considered the minimal clinically important clinical difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental health-related quality of life, which was also measured using the MSQoL-54, showed the opposite pattern. Patients who developed MS at a younger age reported worse mental health than those who developed it when they were older, with scores increasing 2.5 points — the minimal clinically important clinical difference for this score — for every 12-year increase in age of onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, physical health scores dropped and mental health scores rose in all patients. This challenges the common practice of dividing study patients into two groups — pediatric and adult onset — and suggests researchers might look more closely at how different ages within those groups may lead to different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Patterns in physical and mental health perceptions seen in pediatric onset MS are also seen in people with young adult-onset MS, challenging the role for studying age of onset dichotomously as done previously,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of time someone has had MS, known as disease duration, did not fully explain the differences in physical and mental health between age groups. Instead, disability levels, measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, did account for 63.7% of the differences in physical health and 61.3% of the differences in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that other factors — possibly related to self-management abilities, disease-modifying therapy use, and social participation — may influence how people with MS experience their physical and mental health, the researchers said. These factors could potentially be changed or improved, offering a strategy to achieve better long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future studies evaluating HrQoL [health-related quality of life] over longer periods will be important to provide evidence-based mental health support to maximize HrQoL for people with young onset MS,” the team wrote. “In contrast, ongoing studies evaluating specific aspects of physical health in older onset MS … will be important to maximize the longevity of physical functioning in people with MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

In that time I have had a front seat to a dramatic version of the adverse effect that oncologists often mention in passing to breast cancer patients using anti-oestrogen therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“How often do you experience this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A dozen times on a good day,” she shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Roughly three-quarters of breast cancers are oestrogen-receptor positive, which means the cancer cells are stimulated by oestrogen. Women with this type of cancer benefit from oestrogen suppression, achieved via different methods including a pill, an injection and removal of the ovaries. This induces menopause in younger women and more complete oestrogen suppression in the already menopausal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With more than 20,000 Australian women and 2 million women worldwide diagnosed with breast cancer every year, anti-oestrogen medication is akin to the penicillin of oncology. Each week, I write, renew and replace multiple scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But while every prescriber mentions the anticipated side-effect of hot flushes, it strikes me that no one (including me) quite explains the living horror that many patients go on to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women who have concluded an arduous trek of chemotherapy and radiation for early breast cancer express the hope of “never having to go through this again”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women with metastatic breast cancer harbour the hope that their cancer, while not curable, may remain at bay for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Every woman’s risk profile warrants a tailored conversation but, broadly speaking, imagine giving this advice: “There is an effective medication to reduce recurrence risk and improve survival. Over the many years you will be on it, you &lt;a href="https://www.bcna.org.au/resources/side-effects/side-effects-by-diagnosis-or-treatment/side-effects-of-hormone-blocking-therapy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;could experience&lt;/a&gt; hot flushes, stiff joints, disturbed sleep, low mood, weight gain and sexual dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If it sounds like punishment served at the end of a punishing diagnosis, it is. However, when a drug works, oncologists want to encourage adherence and hope that the side-effects either don’t occur or can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Vasomotor symptoms”, the medical term for hot flushes, affect up to 90% of women with breast cancer and are often severe. Up to half of all women prescribed anti-oestrogen medication stop taking the drug – and they are just the ones who tell us. Every oncologist knows the heart-sink moment when a high-risk patient declines treatment. But we also know all too well the toll that led them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Given the ubiquitous nature of hot flushes, the lack of good treatments is frustrating. Of the panoply of advertised options such as cognitive behavioural therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, diet, exercise and off-label use of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, none has been shown to help in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then there is the irony of taking one medication to counter the side-effect of another and gaining weight and its associated complications in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As a result, most women just put up with the trailing cost of having breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, there is hope. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2415566" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; of drug versus placebo, a once-daily pill meaningfully reduced hot flushes in women taking anti-oestrogen therapy for breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.bayer.com/en/us/news-stories/elinzanetant" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Elinzanetant&lt;/a&gt; works by affecting the brain signals involved in temperature regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At baseline, women experienced a mean of a dozen daily episodes. By one month, 61% of women on active treatment reported a reduction of at least 50% in the daily frequency of moderate-to-severe hot flushes compared with 27% on placebo. Sleep quality improved, as did overall quality of life. Crossover from placebo to the active drug resulted in similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No drug is without side-effects. More than 60% of women in each group reported at least one mild adverse event but severe ones were rare. Somnolence, fatigue and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in the active therapy group but they can also be caused by cancer therapy. More than 90% of women who completed one year of treatment chose to continue for an optional two years, suggesting a high rate of acceptability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c316db28-eaaa-411e-82a3-4c2b678a9d7a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"The experts: oncologists on the simple, doable, everyday things they do to try to prevent cancer","elementId":"c316db28-eaaa-411e-82a3-4c2b678a9d7a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/11/the-experts-oncologists-on-the-simple-doable-everyday-things-they-do-to-try-to-prevent-cancer"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The drug is yet unapproved and oncologists will seek more details before widespread prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Breast cancer outcomes are poorer in non-white women but 88% of the participants were white.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology report walking more than 100 minutes per day was associated with a 23% lower risk of chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Low back pain affects people of all ages and accounts for 7.7% of all years lived with disability worldwide, ranking among the most costly chronic conditions in health care. In the US, back pain generates some of the highest health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking is the most affordable and accessible form of exercise for many. While &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/guidelines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend maintaining &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; for the management of chronic low back pain, they offer no explicit targets for walking frequency or duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Volume and Intensity of Walking and Risk of Chronic Low Back Pain," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835297" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prospective+cohort+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prospective cohort study&lt;/a&gt; to examine whether accelerometer-derived daily walking volume and walking intensity are associated with the risk of chronic LBP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included 11,194 adults aged 20 years or older without chronic low back pain at baseline, drawn from the Trøndelag Health Study between 2017 and 2019, with follow-up from 2021 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two tri-axial AX3 accelerometers worn for a week measured daily walking volume and walking intensity. Self-reported &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+low+back+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic low back pain&lt;/a&gt; at follow-up, defined as pain lasting three months or longer in the past 12 months, served as the primary outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those walking 101–124 minutes per day showed a risk ratio of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68–0.87), and those walking 125 minutes or more showed a risk ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67–0.87). Higher walking intensity was also associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest public health strategies promoting walking volume may confer more pronounced preventive benefits than walking intensity for reducing the burden of chronic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/low+back+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;low back pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

To provide an apt example, an Instagram video shows how a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Baker attracts all kinds of animals. In the caption, the adorable and gentle pooch is referred to as “A real life Disney Prince.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever’s interaction with various animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent video on Instagram features a compilation of clips of a Golden Retriever’s interaction with various animals. Describing the pet’s personality, his owner mentions a line on it, saying, “My golden has the gentlest soul and attracts all kinds of animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video begins with the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180020-dog-lounging-pool-pregnant-mom-viral-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; named Baker showcasing a curious face while looking at a bird. The two creatures observe each other in close proximity. In the next scene, someone holds a dragonfly while the pooch tries to jump a little and smell it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/bakerbarnes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Baker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Baker&lt;/a&gt; interacts with a Koi fish as he leans towards a pond, and one fish jumps up and tries to hold the canine’s nose. He pulls his head back first, but becomes curious again. In the final clip, the pet approaches a flying bug and reacts similarly. Throughout his interactions with different creatures, none of the animals reject Baker’s advances. It proves the dog’s gentle behavior towards others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the video has gained viewers’ attention. They called Baker a “gentle spirit,” “sweetie,” and “gentle soul.” A user commented, “How can you be so sweet,” while another wrote, “What a beautiful little soul your dog has.” Some referred to him as “Disney princess” and “adorable prince.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a few of them liked the Golden Retriever’s interaction with the fish the most. One said, “Oh I love his floppy ears watching the koi fish.” A viewer also mentioned, “i love that the koi fish also wanted to boop him.” Since the upload, the Instagram video has received over 25K likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180029-dog-golden-retriever-animal-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gentle Dog Attracts All Kinds of Animals in Compilation Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gentle Dog Attracts All Kinds of Animals in Compilation Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:12:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9oa0kyWGxtNFVRUnduaVp5MURhWlZHUnNwMTZxWTNLbHZrZjlSaGlWQ1BOcU5PLWk1VnBSVllaakppeS1KSFBsUDFLbkVhblJySVlZX1d6aVlTczJ6NVdlY3I2Z1VrNDNFeUdWcWxxNngyNEVZQk9J</guid></item><item><title>如果您已经接受了这6种日常生活，那么您就是优雅衰老的大师- VegOut | If you’ve embraced these 6 daily routines, you are a master of graceful aging - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNMXUyTzhlZ1o3TTlSR1pqSkI0elg1SjhDY3JHaHQ2QUgtVTRlZlZLZ3lXTFJpaHFwazZYRzFGb2dzRUk2bHZmNGVFWFVwblN3WVBQVm9NdXIwVGdiMndYZmFFRGRpaWszV25jVGhQMTU5M0VRYU1jM1I0RTlfSVBEMWk5Mzc1Y2VCWWUyZHhsNzdrODZvQnR5MEM0MnlSd3ZHYTNMOFNSZXRXQkIxNTdPTVhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;We were halfway through brunch when my friend Cora—who just turned 60—whipped a resistance band from her purse “in case a park workout breaks out later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;Everyone laughed, but no one was surprised. Cora has become the unofficial yard‑stick for aging well in our circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="118" data-end="515"&gt;She carries herself with the calm of someone who’s done the emotional math and decided each day is worth compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;That got me thinking: What line items belong on the “aging gracefully” balance sheet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;After a decade of turning financial dashboards into habit trackers, I’ve landed on six daily routines that raise your vitality bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="517" data-end="849"&gt;Each one is actionable, budget‑friendly, and—if you already practice them—proof you’re ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="856" data-end="892"&gt;1. Moving like it’s non‑negotiable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;Picture a zero‑based budget: every dollar gets assigned before the month begins.&lt;br data-start="974" data-end="977"&gt;Graceful agers treat movement the same way—no leftovers, no “maybe tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;My own spreadsheet shows three non‑consecutive 10‑minute blocks: a brisk walk between morning meetings, a set of body‑weight squats before lunch, and a dance‑along video after work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="894" data-end="1296"&gt;That’s it. Thirty minutes, yet the ROI keeps compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1298" data-end="1675"&gt;Harvard epidemiologist &lt;strong data-start="1321" data-end="1338"&gt;Dr. I‑Min Lee&lt;/strong&gt; calls exercise “the closest thing we have to a magic pill” for longevity &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2023/harvard-scientists-exercise-science-and-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;harvardmagazine.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1298" data-end="1675"&gt;The benefits read like an all‑in‑one ETF: lower blood pressure, better insulin sensitivity, brighter mood. And because micro‑workouts sidestep the “I need an hour” objection, they’re the easiest way to lock in gains daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1677" data-end="1877"&gt;If you’re already penciling movement into your calendar—walking calls, stair breaks, yoga stretches while the kettle boils—you’re signaling to your future self that mobility is non‑negotiable capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1884" data-end="1924"&gt;2. Prioritizing sleep like your 401(k)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1926" data-end="2207"&gt;You wouldn’t skip automatic contributions to a retirement plan; why skip the nightly deposits of deep sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1926" data-end="2207"&gt;Neuroscientist &lt;strong data-start="2050" data-end="2068"&gt;Matthew Walker&lt;/strong&gt; calls sleep “the Swiss Army knife of health” &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/13/563831137/the-swiss-army-knife-of-health-a-good-nights-sleep?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;npr.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, repairing everything from memory to immune function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2209" data-end="2460"&gt;A trick I borrowed from budgeting: “pay yourself first.” At 9 p.m., phone goes on airplane mode, lights dim, lo‑fi playlist cues the wind‑down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2209" data-end="2460"&gt;This simple rule shaved 20 minutes off my sleep‑onset time—worth roughly two extra hours of REM per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2728"&gt;Already guarding an eight‑hour window? That’s mastery in action. Quality sleep stabilizes appetite hormones, sharpens emotional regulation, and even improves skin barrier repair—dividends makeup can’t fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2728"&gt;Keep treating bedtime like it belongs on the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2735" data-end="2774"&gt;3. Feeding your gut’s retirement fund&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="3075"&gt;Fiber and fermented foods are the dividend stocks of nutrition: boring until you notice they keep paying out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2776" data-end="3075"&gt;I batch‑prep overnight oats with chia and stir a spoonful of homemade kimchi (my old fermenting hobby) into salads. The goal is 25–30 grams of fiber and at least one probiotic food daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3077" data-end="3343"&gt;Why? A diverse gut microbiome produces short‑chain fatty acids that lower inflammation—an under‑the‑radar driver of age‑related decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3077" data-end="3343"&gt;People who age gracefully often talk about “feeling light” after meals; their microbiota balance is doing unsung heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3345" data-end="3533"&gt;If you’re already sipping kombucha, sprinkling flaxseed, or swapping white rice for quinoa, you’re future‑proofing your metabolism and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3345" data-end="3533"&gt;Consider it interest that never stops accruing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3540" data-end="3573"&gt;4. Keeping curiosity on autopay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3575" data-end="3812"&gt;Remember Cora’s resistance band? She also just took a pottery class and is learning basic Korean, because K‑dramas “hit different when you get the jokes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3575" data-end="3812"&gt;Novel skill‑building isn’t a midlife vanity project; it’s neural cross‑training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3814" data-end="4132"&gt;A Johns Hopkins–led study found that older adults who learned multiple real‑world skills simultaneously showed cognitive gains comparable to people 30 years younger &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10394988/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3814" data-end="4132"&gt;Think of each new hobby—gardening, coding, ukulele—as a diversified asset that hedges against mental stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4134" data-end="4395"&gt;Already blocking 20 minutes for Duolingo, Udemy, or a DIY home‑repair video? You’re feeding the brain’s growth budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4134" data-end="4395"&gt;Keep stacking micro‑lessons; the returns arrive as sharper recall, creative problem‑solving, and a sense of agency no wrinkle cream can match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4402" data-end="4443"&gt;5. Banking micro‑moments of mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4445" data-end="4658"&gt;When anxiety spikes, I open a blank Google Sheet, breathe three times, and do nothing else for 60 seconds—it’s my mental “reconciliation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4445" data-end="4658"&gt;The point isn’t productivity; it’s noticing tension before it compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4660" data-end="4961"&gt;Mindfulness practices—from two‑minute box breaths to a phone‑free walk—reduce cortisol and strengthen the prefrontal cortex, the decision‑maker that keeps reactions aligned with long‑term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4660" data-end="4961"&gt;The beauty? You can sprinkle these pauses between any tasks without blocking extra calendar real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5194"&gt;If you’re already pausing to sense your shoulders unclench or naming the flavor of your coffee before chugging it, you’re not just calm—you’re structurally upgrading neural circuitry that decides how gracefully you navigate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5201" data-end="5238"&gt;6. Cultivating social micro‑touches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;Longevity researchers keep circling back to one metric: meaningful connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;Yet the graceful agers I survey don’t necessarily have huge networks; they have consistent micro‑touches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5240" data-end="5543"&gt;A 90‑second voice note to a cousin, a two‑line text to an old colleague, a hallway compliment that says “I see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5545" data-end="5846"&gt;Think of each interaction as a small deposit into a shared emotional account. Over months, it yields trust, perspective, even accountability—critical when setbacks hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5545" data-end="5846"&gt;Social micro‑touches also act like real‑time market indicators; they reveal when your energy is dipping or resentment creeping in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5848" data-end="6020"&gt;If you’re already nudging relationships forward with tiny, authentic gestures, you’re reinforcing a safety net that cushions aging’s inevitable curveballs. That’s graceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6027" data-end="6043"&gt;Final words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6045" data-end="6161"&gt;Aging well isn’t a grand slam; it’s dollar‑cost averaging—steady inputs that harness time instead of wrestling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6163" data-end="6172"&gt;If you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6173" data-end="6432"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6173" data-end="6219"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6175" data-end="6219"&gt;schedule movement like a standing expense,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6220" data-end="6266"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6222" data-end="6266"&gt;clock eight solid hours as non‑negotiable,&lt;/p&gt;

But sometimes even your favorite foods can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The food we eat is packed with different nutrients that impact our bodies in their own ways. When you take medication and eat certain foods, they can interact negatively and affect the efficacy of your medication or induce unpleasant side effects. And some of the most common culprits are ingredients you may already have in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We consulted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewfranklynmiller/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller," data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Dr Andy Franklyn-Miller,&lt;/a&gt; MBBS, PhD, MRCGP FFSEM, a dual board-certified Sports and Exercise Medicine Physician and Chief Medical and Innovation Officer at &lt;a href="https://www.nuritas.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nuritas.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nuritas" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Nuritas&lt;/a&gt;, to break down some of the most common foods that can interact with medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But first, a disclaimer: this is by no means an exhaustive list of ingredients or a substitute for medical advice from your own healthcare team. When you start taking a new medication, we suggest you consult your doctor or pharmacist about what foods to look out for and how to adjust your diet accordingly. Depending on the medication and your own individual care plan, those adjustments can range from avoiding a food entirely to reducing your intake to carefully timing the consumption of your food with your doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="grapefruit" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you take prescription medication, you may need to put down your &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a43758194/paloma-cocktail-recipe/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="paloma" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;paloma&lt;/a&gt;. Grapefruit, as well as its juice, is a common ingredient that interacts with a wide range of prescriptions. “Grapefruit inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 in the liver and intestines, which metabolizes many drugs,” Franklyn-Miller says. “This can lead to higher drug concentrations in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Without this enzyme, your medications will accumulate and linger in your bloodstream, which can increase your risk of side effects. Grapefruit causes interactions across several drug categories, including statins, calcium channel blockers, and immunosuppressants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dairy-products" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1wn44x5 e1geg53v2"&gt;Jose A.

One of the most common nutrients is vitamin K, which plays an essential role in blood clotting and bone health. But if you take certain anticoagulant blood pressure medications, vitamin K is more harmful than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Foods like spinach, kale, and broccoli, high in vitamin K, can counteract the effects of anticoagulants like warfarin, which relies on inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors to prevent blood clots,” says Franklyn-Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="alcohol" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Medical professionals warn about the adverse health effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, which is classified as a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a64342317/is-drinking-wine-every-day-healthy/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="carcinogen" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;. But beyond increasing your risk of cancer and organ damage in the long term, alcohol also can have a significant impact on your prescription medications in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Alcohol can amplify or diminish the effects of medications,” Franklyn-Miller says. “For instance, it enhances the sedative effects of benzodiazepines like diazepam and increases the risk of liver toxicity when combined with acetaminophen.” Alcohol also greatly increases the sedative effects of melatonin, which is why Franklyn-Miller suggests the use of other natural peptides as alternative sleep aids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="aged-cured--fermented-foods" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Aged, Cured, &amp;amp; Fermented Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-17" data-node-id="23" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1wn44x5 e1geg53v2"&gt;LauriPatterson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1j11w10 e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1wn44x5 e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some of the oldest and most prevalent food preservation techniques, like aging, curing, and fermenting, lead to the development of the amino acid tyramine. Tyramine can be found in large quantities in foods like cheese, soy sauce, sauerkraut, sausages, and different types of alcohol. It’s a natural byproduct of these preservation processes, but tyramine also interacts with particular medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Franklyn-Miller says tyramine-rich foods “can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), used for depression or Parkinson’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again: this list isn't comprehensive, nor is it meant to replace guidance from your doctor or medical team.

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking coffee appears to be linked with healthier aging by potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A recent study followed over 47,000 women for several decades, and it found that those who consumed the highest amounts of caffeine, primarily from coffee, have 13% greater odds of healthy aging,” said&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/providers/christieyoussef" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Christie Youssef&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician with Kaiser Permanente in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Healthy aging in this study was defined as reaching the age of 70 or older without major chronic diseases or cognitive impairment,” said Youssef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Youssef said the study adds to a growing body evidence of benefits of caffeinated coffee, but cannot prove direct cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084789" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;According to the study, researchers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t find any indication that tea or decaffeinated coffee held the same benefits as caffeinated coffee. Drinking more cola was tied to a significantly lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To consume coffee moderately, you want to consider sticking to two to four cups per day,” said Youssef. “And keep in mind that one cup means 8 ounces, not a jumbo mug.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She suggests avoiding limiting sugar and high fat creamers, especially those containing processed additives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Think about flavoring your coffee with a splash of unsweetened plant milk, or cinnamon or vanilla extract, instead of syrups or flavored creamers,” Youssef said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While benefits of caffeine include improved alertness and memory support, excessive intake can cause jitteriness and insomnia, headaches or increased heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdmcd.co/k9MRKx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The research&lt;/a&gt;, led by Harvard University’s school of public health, was presented on June 2 at the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

the medications on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/social-media"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, often illegally, and thanks to online pharmacies, it seems easier than ever to get hold of some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;While some blokes might think they've stumbled upon a miracle, it seems its all an illusion (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic penis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Well, some blokes who have been using the drug are reporting some growth downstairs, with plenty of people on Reddit noticing the 'issue'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the comments, multiple site users confirmed they’d also seen positive change, which is certainly more than can be said to the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-health-warning-mhra-471511-20250605"&gt;less fortunate females&lt;/a&gt; who are using the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But before you go rushing to buy some, in the hope that you can gain rather than lose as most people use the jabs for, a urologist has seemingly debunked the theory about maximising your manhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is really happening?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Rather than it actually adding centimetres to your member, it seems as if the fat around the penis is actually just reducing, which gives off the illusion of things being a bit bigger - which is certainly better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to HuffPost UK, urologist Dr Martina Ambardjieva explained: “As a urologist, I can say there’s no evidence that semaglutide (Ozempic) or other GLP-1 agonists cause actual penile tissue growth,” she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic has become very popular among those wanting to lose weight (Getty stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“However, there is a plausible physiological explanation for why some men perceive their penis to be larger after significant weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“When a man loses weight, particularly rapidly as with GLP-1 drugs, this fat pad shrinks, revealing more of the shaft and making the penis appear longer,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It’s not growth, it’s exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Still, this sounds like sunshine and rainbows compared to some of the other less desirable side effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 14:38:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNWGRVemN5NlB6c0l3bEFxTDNya18zYmpFTVRDcnFPSXhZajJhaHF4NktmSUJuS1JLZXAwcTg4ZTRqMXY5QmhxYVpLbVNjckhidEpvUThSNC1KSXZsRGc5ekdiZWFXaU5uN0wyYXFZekdQa2lZNlp3elFvZnl6WG1iV3BtT2huOC1URHdJQjA0aE1BZkpYUk9sZzBvWVJPZzdLSFE</guid></item></channel></rss>
