                Three scientists learned they carry genes that significantly increase their risk for Alzheimer's. Here's how they're grapping with the news, and working to keep their brains healthy.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;People who inherit two copies of a gene variant called APOE4 have a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer's by age 85.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Only about 2% to 3% of people in the U.S. have this genetic profile, and most of them don't know it because they've never sought genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But three scientists are among those who did get tested, and learned that they are in the high-risk group. Now, each is making an effort to protect not only their own brain, but the brains of others with the genotype known as APOE4-4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;June: from dismay to hope&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A genetic test from 23andMe gave June the bad news in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just felt like the end of the world," says June, who asked to use only her first name out of fear that making her genetic status public could affect her job or health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;June was 57 when she found out. As someone with a doctorate in biochemistry, she quickly understood what the results meant.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"People with our genotype are almost destined to get the disease," she says. "We tend to get symptoms 7 to 10 years earlier than the general population, which means that I had about seven years left before I may get the disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, June spent sleepless nights online, reading academic papers about Alzheimer's and genetics. She even looked into physician-assisted suicide in an effort to make sure she would not become a burden to her adult son.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she discovered online communities like &lt;a href="http://apoe4.info" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ApoE4.info&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included people with her genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I not only found useful information, I forged deep friendships with people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;June learned about the brain benefits of a Mediterranean diet, exercise, sleep, and stress reduction. And while perusing the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; website, she discovered an intriguing research project at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an ongoing &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT06124339" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see whether four months of vigorous mental and physical exercise can improve brain health in people ages 50 to 85.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So in 2024, June found herself on a stationary bicycle at UCSD playing a strenuous virtual reality game.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You're riding a bike and you go through unfamiliar terrain where you need to make turns," she says. "So you really have to use all your cognitive reserve."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also involved a series of MRI scans and cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was absolutely a game changer because I not only got to watch my brain in action, I was able to develop really effective strategies of retaining my memory," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Since participating in that trial, June has been advocating for federal funding for Alzheimer's research and urging the Food and Drug Administration to consider drugs that might benefit people who have the APOE4-4 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I realize that being APOE4-4 is not the end of the world," June says. "There's so many things we can do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;David Watson: drug discovery&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of mental and physical activity might delay the symptoms of Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://www.researchalz.com/alzheimers-treatment-center-staff/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Watson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist and CEO of the Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Center in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that's not enough for him and other people who carry two copies of APOE4 variant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Any of these things that we can do preventively, they're going to be helpful," Watson says. "But are they going to override genetics? No, they're not, unfortunately."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watson, now in his mid 50s, learned his genetic status about 25 years ago after seeing several family members develop Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He decided to devote his career to running clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs in hopes of finding one that might protect his brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That effort helped get two new drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5300930/did-an-alzheimers-drug-give-sue-and-ken-bell-more-time-maybe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lecanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on the market. Unfortunately, Watson is not a good candidate for either drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lecanemab and donanemab are both monoclonal antibodies that remove sticky amyloid plaques from the brain — a hallmark of Alzheimer's. But in people with Watson's genetic profile, the drugs often cause dangerous swelling or bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone is APOE-4-4, they should probably should not go on a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid," he says. Or if they do, it should be "very cautiously with additional counseling," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Watson has been focusing on an &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/pipeline/alz-801-development/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experimental drug&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that's meant specifically for people with two copies of APOE4. The pill, which was tested in some patients at his center, is designed to interrupt the process that leads to amyloid plaques, rather than removing plaques that have already formed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This particular compound actually showed remarkable findings," Watson says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug, made by Alzheon, didn't cause brain swelling or bleeding. And it prevented brain areas associated with memory from shrinking the way they usually do in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/topline-results-from-pivotal-apolloe4-phase-3-trial-of-oral-valiltramiprosate-alz-801-in-patients-with-early-alzheimers-disease-carrying-two-copies-of-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;large trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the drug failed to clearly show it could slow down cognitive decline in people who already had Alzheimer's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Watson thinks the Alzheon drug has potential.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some study participants who've stayed on the drug seem to be "holding their own" instead of getting worse, Watson says. And blood tests of these participants suggest that "we're really making a difference in keeping neurons alive," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Wendy Nelson: Going very public&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When a genetic test from 23andMe showed that Wendy Nelson carried two copies of the APOE4 variant, she went quiet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just sort of didn't want to tell anybody at first," she says. "I really just kept the results to myself."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nelson, 54, is a PhD scientist in the biotech industry. So she knew what the results meant. But she didn't know what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She was already taking part in the sort of activities that might protect her brain. "I'm a triathlete, a hardcore hiker, I eat healthy," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when she learned her status in 2022, about the only changes she could make were to stop drinking and start a cholesterol drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, one of Nelson's biotech contacts put her in touch with a &lt;a href="https://beingpatient.com/event/biotech-and-business-development-leader-wendy-nelson-on-living-with-the-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about dementia and brain health. They asked her to do an interview. She agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was at the point where no one knew what my status was," she says."But in my mind, I was thinking, well, who's ever going to see this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of people, it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pretty soon, Nelson found herself on other podcasts, being interviewed by Reuters, and eventually appearing on TV news. She began working with advocacy groups including the &lt;a href="https://apoe4alzheimersalliance.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;APOE4-4 Alzheimer's Alliance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nelson says being a public face for the APOE4-4 community gives her a chance to educate the public about a genetic profile that affects about 800,000 people in the U.S. It also gives her a forum to advocate for more basic research on Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And just a few weeks ago, Nelson got a chance to meet with officials of the Food and Drug Administration to talk about Alzheimer's drugs for people like her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I provided my seven minutes of testimony to the to the FDA, which was my plea for more options," she says, "because I don't feel like I have anything out there right now."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But Nelson, like June and Watson, says people in the APOE4-4 community can change that by pushing for more research and an easier regulatory path for drugs that might help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

COVID killed 1½%. Since I wrote this book, we have uncovered a new virus in China — from a bat in a cave, it wasn’t from a lab — that has the same high-efficiency transmission potential that COVID did. And it has the same genetic characteristics as a MERS or SARS that could kill 30% of the people infected. That’s floating out there right now. That, tomorrow, could be the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; So preparedness, particularly in the area of vaccines, will be more crucial, even as your book notes the current government is skeptical of, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/few-minnesota-kids-get-covid-shots-but-federal-switch-could-make-access-harder-for-families/601363236" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/few-minnesota-kids-get-covid-shots-but-federal-switch-could-make-access-harder-for-families/601363236"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.

What we need to have happen is a general understanding of why we need to be better prepared. Do you think there will be better preparedness for a flooding of the Guadalupe River in the future? I think so. We need to have the mindset that it’s going to cost us to do this but it’s an incredible insurance policy for society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;By:&lt;/b&gt; Michael T.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In August 2024, the news came in quick succession. On Tuesday — Aug. 13, 2024 — Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency of continental concern. The very next day, the World Health Organization followed suit elevating the mpox outbreak to its highest threat level. We published a story with the headline: "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/08/14/g-s1-16977/mpox-public-health-emergency-world-health-organization-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO declares 2024 mpox surge a 'public health emergency of international concern.'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, those emergency declarations are still in effect but mpox has faded from the headlines. This story is a continuation of our annual series — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;"Whatever happened to …"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — that follows up on previous reporting to see where things stand now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-86303-100"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When Caroline Mugun shows up at work in Mombasa, Kenya, the patients are behind subdividers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You see the agony the patient goes through. It's on another level," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mugun works in an mpox isolation ward run by Doctors Without Borders, where patients stay as their painful lesions heal. The hope is to prevent the virus, which is contagious and spreads sexually and through close contact, from further expanding its reach. Before this outbreak, Kenya had never reported mpox cases before. Now, Africa CDC says the virus has shown up in Kenya's capital and it worries cases could grow exponentially, as has happened in other urban centers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kenya is far from alone. During this mpox outbreak, many countries — from Gambia to Burundi, from Uganda to South Sudan — have dealt with mpox for the first time. Today, 26 African countries are in the midst of mpox outbreaks, up from 13 a year ago according to Africa CDC. And, while recent estimates suggest cases are dropping in several key countries, Africa CDC says, there have been over 100,000 suspected mpox cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Critics say the global response has fallen dangerously short, expressing frustration and fear that the world has not acted more swiftly to contain the virus. These critiques come despite the fact that $1.1 billion has been pledged by countries, foundations and international organizations to support mpox control. Here is a look at where the mpox crisis stands and what that means for future outbreaks of other serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Walking blind"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When WHO rang the alarm bells a year ago, a new strain of mpox — officially called clade 1b — had just emerged and was spreading fast, particularly among sex workers and their clientele. The epicenter of this outbreak was the war-torn eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Far from the forest, where mpox typically spillover from small infected animals, this area is known for immense mineral wealth, and it attracts laborers from many of the neighboring countries. Soon, the new strain was popping up in those nearby nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year to now, and the new strain has taken off. It's shown up in places as far apart as China and the United Kingdom, the U.S and Turkey. There have also been big outbreaks in Africa of the other mpox strains. By Africa CDC's count, there have been over 700 deaths so far this year. However, mpox experts say, the numbers are likely a severe undercount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have really gone off a kind of data cliff," says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University. "We are flying blind. But since the response is so stalled, I'm not sure it's really flying. I think we're probably more like walking blind."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for the limited data, including stigma associated with a sexually transmitted disease and cases often emerging in remote areas where there's limiter surveillance and diagnostic capacity. However, Beyrer says, another reason for the imprecise figures is President Trump's cuts to foreign aid. The Democratic Republic of Congo was among the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance, and some of that money went to the mpox response, including the transportation of samples from clinics to laboratories for testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What data there is suggests that the geographic reach of the virus has expanded substantially but, in recent months and weeks, the number of cases on the continent seems to be dropping, driven by a decline in cases in the DRC, Sierra Leone and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Three steps backward"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with cases dropping, plenty of mpox specialists are raising grave concerns about the global response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This has basically been a very frustrating year," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University. "I feel like for every two steps of progress that have been made, there have been three steps backward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many point to vaccines as the epitome of how the response has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox is a vaccine-preventable disease, and yet, to date about 907,000 people have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the mpox vaccine in a dozen African countries. Just over 3 million doses have been delivered to the continent. That's according to Africa CDC, which had previously put the target at 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The challenges started early on: When the WHO declared the public health emergency, it still had not green-lit the mpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like: 'Well, you either have an emergency or you don't,'" says Beyrer. At the time, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/05/g-s1-20983/mpox-vaccines-africa-congo" target="_blank"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that anyone was moving slowly, saying WHO experts didn't have complete information with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. "We will not take shortcuts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. vaccine donation is an example of a pledge that failed to fully materialize. Then-President Joe Biden promised to send &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai" target="_blank"&gt;1 million doses&lt;/a&gt; to Africa in September 2024. However, as of July 2025, only about 90,000 had made it to the continent. Of the remaining doses, about half are now too close to their expiration date to ship, according to &lt;a href="https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/team/yap-boum-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Yap Boum&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of Africa CDC's mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They can no longer be sent to the continent, which is a huge loss, because that one dose of vaccine is $100," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, he says, there's hope that things will improve. For example, in early September, Kenya is supposed to start an mpox vaccination campaign. Nurse Mugun says people are eagerly awaiting the rollout&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the U.S. vaccine pledge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a series of questions about the global mpox response, the U.S. State Department said in a written statement that the U.S. is planning to provide over 200,000 mpox vaccine doses to five African countries and will ensure the doses are used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the future? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji of Emory University worries that the lack of response may undercut the value of the WHO alert system. Same with Africa CDC's emergency declaration, which marked the first time the body ever issued a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. "If we have had the highest level of alert for 12 months on a particular emergency and that hasn't really put a dent in the containment, how impactful is this lever?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director-general of Africa CDC, disagrees with the suggestion that not much has happened to contain mpox. "Africa didn't have this capacity. It's now that we are building capacity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that a year ago, no African country had granted regulatory approval for the mpox vaccine that the U.S. was hoping to send. Now, 17 countries have approved it. Similarly, he says, the laboratory network used to test suspected mpox cases has grown significantly in the hot spots. For example, Burundi had two labs capable of testing mpox a year ago and now has 56.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Plus, he adds, this is the first time there has been coordination and collaboration across the continent with an African body helping to lead the charge and fairly allocate resources. Kaseya argues that without the emergency declaration, the resources that have been pledged would not have materialized. Still, he acknowledges, there is a lot more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Titanji agrees there is more work to do. She warns that the world is watching in real time as the virus becomes entrenched in the human population. "The virus will evolve the more opportunities that it is given," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/anne-rimoin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anne Rimoin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and an mpox researcher, says that so far in this mpox emergency, the U.S. has been largely spared — but that may not last. "Diseases we ignore abroad can quickly land on our doorstep," she says. "We've been lucky so far. I don't know how long our luck will hold out."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size"&gt;&lt;span&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;very few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in eastern China, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports, and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 1.5-hour ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 7 a.m. the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood drawn in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek treated her differently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on February 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What is causing high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot in March. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise, and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr. DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You are my best health adviser!” she praised it once. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation~ 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing too!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-normal-font-size"&gt;I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced. I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models, chatbots are weaving themselves into seemingly every part of society in China, the U.S., and beyond. For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing"&gt;therapists&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/nyregion/ai-robot-elliq-loneliness.html"&gt;robot companions&lt;/a&gt; for the elderly. For the sick, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/chat-gpt-mental-health-suicide.html"&gt;anxious&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/ai-is-about-to-solve-loneliness-thats-a-problem"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt;, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mother was &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our hometown, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of 8 million people. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub and home to &lt;span class="explainer-tag"&gt;&lt;mark class="term"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba" aria-label="Click to learn more about Alibaba."&gt;Alibaba&lt;span class="info-icon"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;span class="description"&gt;&lt;span class="explainer-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg aria-label="Close" role="button" class="close"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#X"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall.&lt;span class="read-more"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#chevron"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and, years later, would host DeepSeek. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our hometown, and visited only occasionally — my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked, and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China’s health care system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs, and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--wide  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the hospitals are public, they largely operate &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/anti-corruption-campaign-chinas-medical-sector-unmasking-hidden-agenda"&gt;as businesses&lt;/a&gt;, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meager salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown on &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3293019/40000-punished-chinas-medical-corruption-crackdown-including-over-350-top-figures"&gt;medical corruption&lt;/a&gt;, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s health care system have gotten only more intense, and the system’s failures have &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/24/violence-against-doctors-in-china-is-commonplace"&gt;led to widespread distrust of medical professionals&lt;/a&gt;. That has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our hometown. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes, and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, cycling between patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When my mother&lt;/strong&gt; was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series of &lt;a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1592"&gt;medical ad scandals&lt;/a&gt;, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, and &lt;span class="explainer-tag"&gt;&lt;mark class="term"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu" aria-label="Click to learn more about Xiaohongshu."&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;span class="info-icon"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;span class="description"&gt;&lt;span class="explainer-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg aria-label="Close" role="button" class="close"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#X"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book” in Chinese, is a lifestyle e-commerce and social media platform.&lt;span class="read-more"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#chevron"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who suffer from the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors have turned into&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/china-doctor-influencer-money-douyin/"&gt; influencers&lt;/a&gt;, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies, and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online, but like many other aging parents, she was stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--fullwidth  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large-language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9947764/"&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that ChatGPT achieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Last year, Google &lt;a href="https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; its fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark, while a specialized &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/31/9/1833/7645318"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; trained on Meta’s Llama likewise excelled in medical exams. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalizing to AI advocates. In one 2024 &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least junior doctors in diagnosing &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341"&gt;eye problems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01486-5#Sec9"&gt;stomach symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11263899/#sec15"&gt;emergency room cases&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence.” Of course, researchers are also flagging risks of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00601-z"&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1.full-text"&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt; that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatments, and deeper health care disparities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities. It has performed well on medical tests too. In one recent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03726-3"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that DeepSeek’s R1 performed similarly or better than OpenAI’s o1 in some medical tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning. Meanwhile, it lagged behind in others, such as evaluating radiology reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ignoring some of the limitations, users in the U.S. and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by health research firm KFF. On Reddit, users shared &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kaw3cv/chatgpt_diagnosed_my_uncommon_neurologic/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ales5b/chatgpt_helped_me_solve_my_7_year_undiagnosable/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of ChatGPT diagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people also &lt;a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30287945"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; consulting chatbots for treatments for themselves, their children, and their parents.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An electronics factory worker in Jiangsu province, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told me he consulted three different chatbots after his mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer, just to check if her doctor was right in telling her not to worry. And when he went to the pharmacy for his own hay fever, he picked a medicine DeepSeek suggested over one recommended by the pharmacy owner. “[Owners] always recommend the most expensive ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real Kuang, a photographer in the city of Chengdu, asks DeepSeek about her parents’ health issues: how to treat her father’s throat inflammation, whether they should take calcium supplements, if her mother should get shoulder surgery. “Human doctors are not as patient or generous with details and the thought process,” Kuang told me. “DeepSeek made us feel more cared for.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in the office of Dr. DeepSeek, she is at ease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements, and medicines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analyzed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks, and offered portion recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, like watermelon soup. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. My weight is 39.5 kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyze the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fiber. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables, and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You are not alone.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m so happy with your improvement!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mother’s reliance&lt;/strong&gt; on DeepSeek grew over the months. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid sitting while leaning forward, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two U.S.-based nephrologists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr. Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anemia — using a hormone called erythropoietin — could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary, or a “kind of fantasy,” Topf told me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--wide  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know –– it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy, and clinical judgment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03328-5"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialties. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people treat it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18919"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at Oxford University, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, members of the general public were asked to identify health conditions and a subsequent course of action using either large language models or conventional methods, such as search engines and checking the National Health Service website. Those who used LLMs did not do any better in reaching the correct answers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford and the lead author of the study, told me that during the experiment, users omitted important symptoms in their prompts or failed to identify the correct answer when the chatbot suggested a few different options. Large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As my mother&lt;/strong&gt; bonded with DeepSeek, health care providers across China embraced large language models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the release of DeepSeek R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts, and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialized models. One hospital in Sichuan province &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SJRpOk1p3Rkf2m3z2z59lg"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; “DeepJoint,” a model for orthopaedics that analyzes CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijing &lt;a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1182/118817.htm"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; “Stone Chat AI,” which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic. Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The tech industry now views health care as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself has &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3313335/deepseek-job-ads-call-interns-label-medical-data-improve-ai-use-hospitals"&gt;begun recruiting interns&lt;/a&gt; to annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibaba &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3312153/alibabas-healthcare-ai-model-scores-high-senior-level-doctors-medical-exams"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that its health care–focused chatbot, trained on top of its Qwen models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder Wang Xiaochuan told a Chinese &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o7wg-YavNVPm-KJxFpJ9uA"&gt;outlet&lt;/a&gt;. Baichuan AI declined my interview request. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay also &lt;a href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102692259.html"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI pediatricians, AI urologists, and an AI insomnia specialist who would be available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3 a.m. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports, and help users book appointments with real doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tian Jishun, a gynecologist in Hangzhou, agreed to lend his persona to Alipay as the company built up its fleet of 200 AI doctors. Tian told me he wanted to be part of the AI revolution, although he admits his digital counterpart is lacking. “It’s like the first iPhone,” he told me. “You never know what the future will be like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhang Chao, founder of AI health care startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China has banned “AI doctors” from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was overall confident with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests, and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--fullwidth  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in health care access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff, and the rural–urban gap in quality care. Chinese media have &lt;a href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/2025/07-02/10441669.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on AI assisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas like the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better health care and education, thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629625000785"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Health Economics&lt;/em&gt;, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specialty. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability, and biases that could actually exacerbate health care disparities. In one &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0305"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyze chest X-rays and discovered that, compared to human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalized groups, such as females, Black patients, and those younger than 40. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&amp;amp;M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai … might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I called&lt;/strong&gt; my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek — about English grammar — to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My one-child policy generation has grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-issues-guidance-basic-elderly-care-system-by-2025-2023-05-21/"&gt;yet to catch up&lt;/a&gt;, but many of us now live far away from our aging parents and are busy navigating our own adulthood challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that — leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington, D.C., who also immigrated from China, recently discovered her own mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, suffers from depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Zhang Jiansheng, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, created an AI-powered tablet that can speak to people with Alzheimer’s disease. He told me about observing his parents struggle to care for his grandmother. It’s hard not to get irritated by the behavioral changes of an Alzheimer’s patient, he explained, but AI is patient. “AI has no emotions,” he said. “It will keep offering encouragement, praise, and comfort to the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our hometown showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8 p.m. and her 8 a.m. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr. DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;

According to Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, Harvard, and Stanford, slightly green bananas are actually better for digestion than overripe ones. Surprising, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram post, Dr. Sethi shared nine fascinating food facts that flip common diet beliefs on their head. From everyday staples like rice to nutrient-packed berries and chia seeds, his insights highlight how small food choices can make a big difference for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real eye-opener? Most of these changes don’t require expensive superfoods or supplements, just a smarter look at what’s already in your kitchen. Whether it’s choosing the right ripeness of fruit or rethinking how you cook rice, tiny tweaks can lead to better digestion, improved energy, and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 food facts for gut health and overall wellness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi captioned his post: “Here are 9 things I refuse to gatekeep about everyday foods.” His goal? To bust food myths and show people how simple dietary tweaks can improve digestion, energy, and long-term health. Let’s break down each of his nine key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slightly green bananas are gut-friendly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenish bananas contain resistant starch, which acts like fiber, aids digestion, and supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria, promoting overall intestinal health. Overripe bananas, on the other hand, are higher in sugar, easier to digest, and may spike blood sugar levels, making them less beneficial for your gut microbiome. So, the next time you pick a banana, choose one with a hint of green for better gut health, enhanced satiety, and a more balanced release of energy throughout the day, supporting both digestive wellness and metabolic stability naturally, which is essential for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rice is not the enemy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume rice leads to weight gain, but Dr Sethi explains it’s about portion and preparation. When cooled and reheated, rice develops resistant starch that improves gut health and helps maintain blood sugar levels. Pairing rice with vegetables and proteins also balances the meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for brown or parboiled rice adds fiber, while mindful chewing and avoiding excess ghee or oil further support healthy digestion and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Berries are natural antioxidants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries aren’t just tasty; they’re loaded with antioxidants that fight inflammation and support heart and brain health. Regular consumption can also boost your immunity while satisfying your sweet cravings in a healthier way. However, it is best to consume in moderation, as excessive intake, especially when paired with other fruits- can contribute to excess sugar consumption. Opting for fresh, organic berries whenever possible maximises nutritional benefits while minimising exposure to pesticides and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chia seeds are tiny powerhouses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, and protein. Chia helps regulate bowel movements, keeps you full longer, and improves heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stabilize blood sugar levels, support bone strength, reduce inflammation, and aid in weight management. Just one spoon added to smoothies, yoghurt, or even water can deliver impressive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yoghurt improves gut balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods like yoghurt are packed with probiotics, which help balance gut bacteria. Regular intake can reduce bloating, support digestion, and even enhance your immune system. Just be careful to choose plain yoghurt without added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts support brain and heart health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds, walnuts, and cashews are excellent sources of healthy fats and protein. They reduce cholesterol, improve memory, and keep you energised throughout the day. A small handful daily is enough to reap their benefits without overloading on calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leafy greens detox your body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fibre. They support detoxification, improve iron levels, and promote glowing skin. Eating them lightly cooked or blended into smoothies maximises nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil is a healthy fat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing refined cooking oils with extra virgin olive oil can boost heart health and lower inflammation. Rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, it’s a staple of the Mediterranean diet, which is linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hydration is underrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking enough water is one of the simplest yet most overlooked health tips. Proper hydration supports digestion, flushes toxins, improves skin health, and keeps your energy levels steady throughout the day. It also helps regulate body temperature, cushions joints, and aids in nutrient absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even mild dehydration can affect focus, mood, and physical performance, so it’s important to sip water regularly rather than waiting until you feel thirsty. Carrying a reusable water bottle and setting reminders can make it easier to stay on track. Small, consistent efforts can lead to lasting benefits for your overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi’s food facts prove that you don’t always need fancy superfoods or strict diets to stay healthy. Instead, making smart choices with everyday foods, like picking slightly green bananas, adding more probiotics, or swapping oils, can make a big difference for your gut and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

These drugs work by helping the liver remove more of the “bad” LDL cholesterol from the blood, which in turn lowers the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries.

However, as Dr. Kunal Sood, MD, highlighted on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN0laGpQmmB/?igsh=dWU5bXVzYmw0bzFl" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, while their benefits are powerful, there are a few side effects worth keeping in mind. His point was not to dismiss statins, but to remind people to stay aware and informed. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Are you aware of the potential diabetes risk associated with statins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

These could be occasional confusions, that come and go. However, these side effects usually improve when the medication is stopped. Large, careful studies haven’t found evidence of long-term harm. In fact, a trial in older adults published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology showed no increase in dementia or cognitive decline among statin users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle pain and weakness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle aches are another worry, especially in the first year of use. But most of the time, they aren’t caused by the statin itself. The SAMSON trial, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031173?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed that 90% of reported muscle symptoms occurred even when patients were unknowingly taking placebo pills, not statins. This means genuine statin-related muscle problems are rare and can usually be managed by adjusting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The US &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-important-safety-label-changes-cholesterol-lowering-statin-drugs?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; updated statin labels to reflect this, but emphasized that the benefits of reducing heart attack and stroke usually far outweigh this small risk. Doctors often balance this by monitoring blood sugar and recommending healthy lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, statins remain one of the most effective and reliable tools we have to protect the heart—what truly matters is working closely with your doctor to tailor them to your unique health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While statins remain one of the most commonly prescribed medications for managing high cholesterol, understanding their potential side effects is equally important. Many of these effects go unnoticed or unmentioned during routine consultations, leaving patients unaware of what to watch for. Staying informed, asking the right questions, and discussing any unusual symptoms with your doctor can help you strike a balance between the benefits of statins and their possible drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adopting healthier habits at 40 can help reduce the risk of chronic disease as you age. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians suggest nuts, teff, berries and more to help you get the nutrients you need to age healthfully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy eating pattern provides essential nutrients to prevent or delay age-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blowing out the candles on your 40th birthday is often accompanied by mixed emotions as you turn the corner into midlife. Besides welcoming new wrinkles and gray hairs, turning 40 may have you thinking about your health in a new light. Chronic diseases commonly associated with aging—like cancer, heart disease, and dementia—that once felt they were “a ways off yet” are now top of mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s no magic food that can turn back the clock, adopting healthier habits at 40 can help reduce the risk of chronic disease as you look forward to your 50s, 60s and beyond. We asked dietitians for their top foods to prioritize at 40—here’s what they recommend. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you already use olive oil regularly when cooking, you are off to a great start at maintaining your health beyond 40. Many of the robust health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet are linked to the use of this popular cooking oil.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; has a healthier fat profile than many other oils (or butter) and is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;—plant-based compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tackling inflammation is important since it’s a common denominator in the development of chronic diseases associated with aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, turning 40 is a great time to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adopt habits that may protect your brain&lt;/a&gt; as you age. One recent study found that consuming about ½ tablespoon of olive oil per day reduced the risk of dying from dementia by 28%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are more than just a healthy and convenient snack option; they are linked with numerous health benefits. Snacking often on nuts is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that women who snacked on three servings of nuts per week throughout their midlife were more likely to be “healthy agers” than those who didn’t eat nuts. Walnuts, in particular, were most likely associated with healthier aging in that study.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prioritizing dark leafy greens is a simple yet powerful way to invest in long-term health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/sarah-nash?pcrit=GS89VgC-" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Nash M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Leafy greens such as arugula, spinach, kale and Swiss chard are essential after 40 for maintaining cognitive function, heart health and bone strength”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A study found an association between fruit and vegetable consumption and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower rates of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. This may not be entirely novel, but the study also highlighted green leafy vegetables (along with cruciferous and red/orange vegetables) as having the greatest beneficial impact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some of those brain-supporting nutrients in leafy greens include “folate, a key nutrient for brain function, as well as antioxidants that promote heart health and may slow cognitive decline,” says Nash. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding more dark, leafy greens to your plate is a simple strategy to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost bone health&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their vitamin K content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Turning 40 is an important time to prioritize bone health—the earlier you start being proactive about protecting them, the better.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A low-effort way to score more fiber and other essential nutrients in your diet after 40 is to add a sprinkle of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-flaxseeds-good-for-you-11733695" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ground flaxseeds&lt;/a&gt; to your oats, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252482/green-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, salads and more. Two tablespoons of flaxseed provide 4 grams of fiber, about 14% of your daily recommended intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like the other foods on this list, it’s a combination of all the unique nutrients in flaxseeds that are responsible for most of the anti-aging benefits. In addition to fiber, “flax seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help to decrease chronic inflammation—something that tends to increase as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://candidlycaitlin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caitlin Ogletree, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. These nutrient-rich seeds may also be particularly helpful for women in their 40s. “Flax seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can help to balance estrogen levels and reduce perimenopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats,” says Ogletree.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-teff"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Teff &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Quinoa, step aside, there’s a new whole grain in town. “Teff is a tiny, gluten-free grain that has been a staple in Ethiopian cuisine for centuries, and it’s gaining popularity worldwide for good reason,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Why should you give this whole grain a try? For starters, research has found that folks who regularly consume more whole grains in mid-life enjoy longer lives with more disease-free years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because whole grains, like teff, are rich in dietary fiber, which helps promote healthy digestion and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supports heart health&lt;/a&gt; per Manaker. Since heart disease remains the number one cause of death for both men and women in the U.S, adding more heart-healthy foods to your diet at 40 can keep your ticker in top top shape.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Strained (Greek-style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your gut microbiome plays a critical role in reducing your risk of chronic disease as you age, making 40 an ideal time to start optimizing your gut health. Strained (Greek-style) yogurt is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/probiotic-rich-foods-that-are-not-yogurt-11794516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in probiotics&lt;/a&gt; and other nutrients that can help beneficial gut bacteria thrive. Research has found that those who thrived in older age were more likely to have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;more diverse gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, with a higher ratio of good-to-bad strains of bacteria, compared to those with numerous health conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching for strained (Greek-style) yogurt versus conventional yogurt also helps you get more protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prioritizing protein in your diet&lt;/a&gt; can help minimize some of the muscle loss that persists after 40.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yogurt is also a good source of another under-the-radar nutrient called choline, which research has linked to better brain health later in life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You probably don’t need much convincing to include more flavorful berries in your diet. These juicy, bite-sized fruits are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in the antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; needed to tackle the oxidative stress and inflammation that put you at increased risk of age-related disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, regularly enjoying berries has been shown to protect your brain against the negative effects of aging and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So stock up on both fresh and frozen berries.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for one food that can boost both your heart and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-protein-for-better-brain-health-8686324" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, fatty fish is our top pick. As we mentioned before, it’s important to start prioritizing your protein intake at 40 to temper the muscle loss that naturally occurs with aging, and fatty fish are a great option. One study found that when individuals over 50 years of age consumed about 5 ounces of fish for lunch twice a week for 10 weeks, they lost less muscle mass than those who didn’t have fish.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides protein, fatty fish like salmon, trout and mackerel are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, “which aid in heart and brain health and help reduce inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://thehomecookingdietitian.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carrie Gabriel, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. For women in their 40s, those omega-3 fats are also helpful for hormone balance and reducing the severity of symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause, per Gabriel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While aging is inevitable, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adopting healthier habits will help&lt;/a&gt; you thrive as you grow older. Turning 40 is a great time to start thinking about your health into your 50s, 60s and beyond. Prioritizing a healthy eating pattern will provide your body with the essential nutrients it needs to prevent or at least delay age-related diseases. Dietitians recommend filling your plate with foods like fatty fish, flaxseeds, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, olive oil, berries and more to make sure you get the right nutrients to age more healthfully.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you picture a pelvic bone, there are many places you can have pain that might or might not be your hips. So first try to figure out if you actually have hip pain or if it’s stemming from something else. For example, back and hip pain commonly occur together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The central issue is that not all hip pain is clearly from the hip. What&lt;br&gt;we typically think about as hip pain, or pain that is located on the side of the hip, may in fact be coming from the hip, the muscles around the hip or joints next to the hip, including the lower back area and SI [sacroiliac] joint,” said &lt;a href="https://rahulshahmd.com/about/dr-shah" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Rahul Shah&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically you can identify hip pain if a deep flexion hurts, like when you’re doing something more intense, like a &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/dumbbell-goblet-squat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;goblet squat&lt;/a&gt;, Ochiai said. You could also just experience general pain when you’re sitting if you happen to flex your hip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have really deep chairs, where the knees come up to the level of the waist, then say they can’t get through the workday because it’s hard to sit that long,” he explained. “A quick fix is either raise your chair and sit forward on the chair so you don’t hyperflex your hip, or get a pillow or cushion and sit on that to raise your legs up higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other signs include “difficulty standing on the affected leg, difficulty with putting on socks or shoes and difficulty with clipping toenails,” Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochiai also said that there’s a hack, or “quick and dirty way,” to see if you might have a hip issue: “Lay on your back and grab the front of your knee with both hands, and pull that knee towards your chest. Then have someone take a picture of how close you got your knee to your chest. Then do it again on the other side. If there’s a marked difference, that’s not just tight muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga, Pilates, strengthening exercises and anything that improves your abdominal strength can help your hip, Ochiai said. His rehab protocols for post-hip surgery patients involve ab and back exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hip and back issues go together like peanut butter and jelly, so improving back strength can unload and actually improve your hip pain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening your glute muscles is also key to improving hip pain. Ochiai recommended performing exercises like hamstring stretches (such as touching your toes) and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a39110810/how-to-do-bodyweight-squats/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;bodyweight squats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t underestimate the power of stretching. Shah said &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/fitness-hip-flexor-stretches" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;hip flexor stretches&lt;/a&gt;, along with knee and ankle mobility stretches, can help achieve a full, painless range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These methods, in combination with visiting a doctor for a more thorough evaluation, will have your hips thanking you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hip-pain-doctor-advice_l_667d68b4e4b05521a7f0f37b" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s automatic responses to images the person sees before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to prevent them doing their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Before the test, volunteers were shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture was one of the eight they had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94264b9-b7a6-4f78-a3b3-bd50aa5dcdf9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr George Stothart from the University of Bath with John Stennard, one of the 54 healthy adults involved in the trial.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: BRACE Dementia Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists found that those with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test cannot identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the tests were performed in people’s homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step, he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time. Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQVHpoemJ1SGxEUGZzaHRSdU5JS3kzaU54UkVlZEhpVGZhTjVNZ2VKZ0pvN2VDNG5uNFpCRDJlR3ZZTi1ZRjBuTVkzMk9MM1JqU1BCR29uNllaXzFTcWt3VW55UFBXVEVKQ1p0NUFXSVBjeXM4a2k3Uy1mckNxWWZObUc2bGhRZFI4Sm8yZU1GTi1xQlVXR3QtNFZLV2tCanVFU1ZjRWtJc0tsUS1aU3d6bUptQXVVblVZQUpzMVcwMHRtWUR1ek1lTA</guid></item><item><title>女性心力衰竭：关键危险因素及预防方法- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjums00xcll</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Heart failure in women: Key risk factors and how to prevent them&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Heart failure in women stems from a mix of traditional risks like hypertension and obesity, and sex-specific factors including hormonal changes, reproductive history and chronic inflammation; early prevention and awareness are key to reducing future heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 22:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE16Q0NMdDk1YzFaY3dqUmxYZ1k2Yl9yMXU3dUJhLTRPM01pNkJOVGF0OTM3c2FKaEpibWM5UnlybWkyWnFHdEFTcU5Qc2FxXzJVTURKSk9RME5wRFpvRDgzUkxRMzJTQVAtaVFn</guid></item><item><title>科学家认为，有一件事会导致你比其他人更容易被蚊子叮咬--LADbible</title><link>https://www.ladbible.com/news/science/why-some-people-get-more-mosquito-bites-than-others-blood-type-o-658677-20250901</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you find yourself being unfairly targeted by mosquitoes on a regular basis, science might have the answer for why you're being singled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Most people would presume that any human is fair game for the pesky flying &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/animals"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;, but it turns out they can be a lot more picky than we might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They don't take a chunk out of just &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, according to boffins who have conducted years of research into the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In fact, the insects can be quite fussy buggers who pick out specific people as their prey - hence why some of us get to swan around bite-free, while our pals end up covered in itchy, red bumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As well as being annoying, these bites &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/world-news/dad-warning-mosquito-bite-infection-795791-20250701"&gt;can be dangerous too&lt;/a&gt;, as mosquitoes often carry &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; which they can then pass on to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Entomology professor Jonathan F. Day recently revealed his hypothesis regarding &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/science/insects-mosquitos-science-animals-world-travel-509566-20250825"&gt;why some humans are mosquito magnets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Scientists reckon they know why some people are bitten by mosquitoes more than others (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates - genetic, other factors - increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off," he said. "The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Lactic acid, which is the chemical that causes our muscles to cramp, is also likely to pin a target on your back, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As well as this, he says that mosquitoes will likely make a beeline for people who prefer dressing in dark &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/fashion"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; as the insects 'are able to contrast you with the horizon'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"How you’re dressed matters," Day added. "If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colours won’t as much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Body heat is another 'really important tactile cue' for mozzies who are seeking out the perfect candidate, while other experts say people who exercise, drink &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/alcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/parenting"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; or overweight are also prime targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But aside from these factors, there's apparently another trait which is attractive to the insects - your blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/science"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; suspect that mosquitoes might be able to sense the varying antigens which are present on the surface of red blood cells, depending on your blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;These antigens, also known as proteins, can be 'secreted' by some of us through bodily fluids like saliva or tears - and people with blood type O secrete H antigen, a precursor to A and B antigen, according &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mosquito-blood-type"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The insects seem to be big fans of people who have the blood type O (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Apparently, this is very appetising to mosquitoes, as a host of studies suggest that people with this blood type are the ones who are targeted by the insects the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41459967"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 1974 found that 'mosquitoes preferentially selected hosts of blood group O' after experts recruited 102 participants to investigate what qualities mozzies are attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15311477/"&gt;2004 study&lt;/a&gt; then solidified this theory, as it found that 'blood group O subjects attracted more' than any other blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, its authors did add: "ABH antigens did not, in general, influence the landing preference of mosquitoes among ABO blood groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In further &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.aje.20190302.13"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2019, boffins again found that the 'highest preference was observed for the blood group' when they set up various feeders filled with different blood types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, sounds like it's hard luck for those who have the blood type O - although a lot of other factors also come into play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/why_are_some_people_tastier_to_mosquitoes_than_others"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the 'question of whether mosquitos prefer a certain blood type is controversial'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It explains: "Separate research notes that experimental and laboratory data evaluating whether blood type makes one person more (or less) attractive to mosquitoes has fuelled a lot of speculation, but the science is contradictory. "Instead, the researchers report that the likelihood of being a 'mosquito magnet' has more to do with skin odours and microbiota than blood type."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 19:58:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNdFUzXzhYM1NDM3d3OWtPZGVJaVQ1ZTJLLXo3NTlueDh0bmFMM3NVZTFpanR3TEx5MHlzV1N1UVBRLUZVTnZMeUdYYVIxZ3BNazZIaTJYSkV2SW5GMC0xWFpERkFsa2ppdXBxMFp3TkI4all4NG9yOW1fcHFuanhUd0VFeHNiUkJwbUxzSXJEeVUzSUkzejVVcWtRS0xUYVR3VnlJem5QY29wOGYxMGVFQVNkRnBjY21XcGc</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家首次表明，神经信号的精确定时决定了大脑如何处理信息- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-neuroscientists-precise-nerve-brain.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been known that the brain preferentially processes information that we focus our attention on—a classic example is the so-called cocktail party effect.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In an environment full of voices, music, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/background+noise/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt;, the brain manages to concentrate on a single voice. The other noises are not objectively quieter, but are perceived less strongly at that moment," explains brain researcher Dr. Eric Drebitz from the University of Bremen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain focuses its processing on the information that is currently relevant—in this case, the voice of the conversation partner—while other signals are received but not forwarded and processed to the same extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Until now, it was unclear how this survival-critical mechanism of selecting relevant information is controlled. When you cross a street and a car suddenly appears from the side, the brain immediately focuses its processing on this one piece of visual information—the movement of the vehicle," says Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other impressions, such as signs, passersby, or billboards, fade into the background as they distract our attention and slow down our reaction. It is only through this targeted prioritization that we are able to react quickly and take evasive action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timing: The key to information processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team led by neuroscientists Andreas Kreiter and Eric Drebitz has now provided the first causal evidence of how the brain transmits and processes relevant information. The work is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62732-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Whether a signal is processed further in the brain depends crucially on whether it arrives at the right moment—during a short phase of increased receptivity of the nerve cells," explains neuroscientist Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nerve cells do not work continuously, but in rapid cycles. They are particularly active and receptive for a few milliseconds, followed by a window of lower activity and excitability. This cycle repeats itself approximately every 10 to 20 milliseconds. Only when a signal arrived shortly before the peak of this active phase did it change the behavior of the neurons."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This temporal coordination is the fundamental mechanism of information processing. Attention makes targeted use of this phenomenon by aligning the timing of the nerve cells so that relevant signals arrive precisely in this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/time+window/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;time window&lt;/a&gt;, while others are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prove the cause of this fundamental mechanism of our brain, selective stimulus transmission was studied in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rhesus+monkeys/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rhesus monkeys&lt;/a&gt;—a species that is very similar to humans in the organization of the cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals performed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/visual+task/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;visual task&lt;/a&gt; on a screen while very weak electrical stimuli were generated in an early section of the visual processing pathway (area V2). These artificial signals were unrelated to the task and served solely as test stimuli. The team then analyzed how these signals affected a downstream area (area V4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The artificially triggered signals only influenced the activity of the nerve cells in V4 when they arrived during a short phase of increased receptivity. If the same signal arrived too early or too late, it had no effect," explains Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If it arrived within the sensitive time window, it not only changed the activity of the nerve cells, but also the behavior of the animals: they reacted more slowly and made more mistakes—from which it can be concluded that the test signal, which contained no information for the task, became part of the processing and thus interfered with the performance of the actual task."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Important for understanding the brain and treating Alzheimer's and ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results provide a basis for developing more precise models of the brain. They show how information is selected and prioritized before it leads to perception, learning, and behavior," says Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this knowledge is not only important for foundation research, but also for the field of medicine, "since diseases such as Alzheimer's and ADHD are associated with problems in the selective processing and storage of relevant information. And also for new technologies such as brain-computer interfaces that communicate directly with the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such systems to work reliably, they must feed in information at precisely timed intervals and correctly read the nerve cell patterns. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) could also benefit from these principles, as they could serve as a template for particularly flexible and efficient processing.&lt;/p&gt;

Her experiences reflect a rare condition known as hyperthymesia, or highly superior autobiographical memory. The report, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neurocase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, highlights her unusual capacity for mental time travel—not only into the past, but also into imagined futures—offering researchers new insight into how autobiographical memory may be organized and accessed in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autobiographical memory refers to the ability to recall personal experiences and events situated in time and space. It includes both general life knowledge and episodic details that help people construct a sense of self and continuity over time. Some individuals possess an exceptionally rich form of this memory. Known as hyperthymesia or autobiographical hypermnesia, this condition is marked by an unusual ability to recall past personal events with extraordinary clarity and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with this ability tend to describe their memories as highly vivid, emotionally intense, and embedded in a strong sense of personal re-experiencing. This subjective feeling—often referred to as autonoetic consciousness—is closely linked to what scientists call mental time travel, or the capacity to mentally revisit the past and pre-experience the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a handful of such cases have been documented in the literature, hyperthymesia remains rare and poorly understood. In this new case report, researchers Valentina La Corte, Pascale Piolino, and Laurent Cohen—based at institutions including the Paris Brain Institute and the Université Paris Cité—explore how one teenage girl’s memory system operates, and how it may contribute to future research on personal memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of the study, referred to as TL, was a 17-year-old high school student in France when she came to the researchers’ attention. She had long known her memory was different. As a child, she would casually mention her ability to mentally revisit past events to check for details, only to be accused of lying by her peers. Eventually, she disclosed this ability to her family at age 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL’s recollections were not merely accurate—they were structured. She described a highly organized internal world where memories were stored in a large, rectangular “white room” with a low ceiling. Within this mental space, personal memories were arranged thematically. Sections were dedicated to family life, vacations, friends, and even her collection of soft toys. Each toy had its own memory tag, including information about when and from whom it was received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these recollections were not purely factual. They carried emotional weight and vivid perceptual details. TL could mentally relive events from both her original perspective and from an outside observer’s view. She described, for instance, her first day of school in striking detail: what she wore, the weather, and the precise visual memory of her mother watching her through the fence. These experiences were accompanied by a strong sense of re-experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to this rich “white room” of personal events, TL referred to her semantic and academic knowledge as “black memory.” This separate system lacked emotional content and spatial organization, and it was acquired through deliberate effort rather than spontaneous recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond memory storage, TL described three additional rooms in her internal world, each associated with specific emotional functions. A cold “pack ice” room helped her cool down when angry. A “problems room” was empty but served as a space for pacing and thinking. A more uncomfortable “military room,” associated with her father’s absence due to military service, was linked to guilt. These features suggest a broader internal architecture shaped by emotional needs and reflective processes, not just memory content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To objectively assess TL’s autobiographical memory, the researchers administered two standardized tasks. The first, the TEMPau task, evaluates how people recall personal events from different life stages. TL was assessed only for childhood and adolescence, given her age. Her scores were well above the norm. She produced highly specific, richly detailed memories and consistently reported a sense of “remembering” rather than simply “knowing” facts. She also demonstrated an ability to shift between field and observer perspectives when describing events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second task, the TEAAM, measured her ability to recall or imagine brief, detailed episodes from both the past and the future. TL again performed at the top of the expected range. Her imagined future events were not only plausible and contextually rich, but also carried a strong feeling of “pre-experience”—a subjective sensation akin to remembering, but applied to anticipated personal events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that TL’s performance declined slightly when imagining more distant future events. This tendency aligns with what is typically seen in the general population: the further away an event is in time, the less vivid and detailed it tends to be. Still, TL’s ability to mentally travel through time—to revisit the past and pre-live the future—was striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TL’s case provides compelling insights, it is important to acknowledge the limits of case studies in general. Single cases do not allow for broad generalizations. There are no control groups for comparison, and findings cannot speak to prevalence or typical development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In TL’s case, the researchers did not use some of the traditional diagnostic tools for hyperthymesia, such as verifying public event recall or testing calendar accuracy over many years. Her superior memory was based on self-report, corroborated by performance on specific tasks, but not benchmarked against the same criteria used in some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also limits to verifying the accuracy of detailed childhood memories. Some events may be reconstructed, influenced by photos, family stories, or even dreams, which TL herself acknowledged as occasional sources of memory content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these constraints, case reports like this one remain an important tool in the scientific study of the mind. When researchers encounter rare or unusual cognitive profiles, documenting them in detail can generate new hypotheses, refine existing theories, and identify directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In TL’s case, her vivid and structured autobiographical memory, along with her conscious and emotionally guided use of mental time travel, points to a potentially unique form of memory organization. Unlike previous cases where hyperthymesia seemed involuntary or overwhelming, TL appeared to have some degree of control over how she accessed and navigated her memories. Her experiences also invite questions about the role of emotion, spatial imagery, and subjective perspective in the construction of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, her use of imagined rooms tied to emotional regulation adds a novel dimension to how memory might interface with other cognitive processes. It hints at the possibility that some individuals may develop internal mechanisms to manage the emotional weight of their memories or structure them in ways that aid retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to generalize findings about hyperthymesia, since they rely on only a few cases. Does ageing affect the memories of these individuals? Do their mental time-travel abilities depend on age? Can they learn to control the accumulation of memories? We have many questions, and everything remains to be discovered. An exciting avenue of research lies ahead,” concludes La Corte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Autobiographical hypermnesia as a particular form of mental time travel&lt;/a&gt;,” was published August 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:19:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOTTdRb2s5RExvdVllUHg2UDhQT2tuMDZUbDRWZTZIZnRfUnV1dVBBRU9YQ1hySFVZcDZTQVpCZm9hTVdVV1BKZEZCYkhDV1JJR0ZHMW9zTXJvS2F6bDVNd0Zhd3lNcWhNSFFXVTlWS0MwcjdTcWF1U1dHYVJUTU05dWhlbFYzWnpGb3lSeEU4ekdmTGtxWnlXQVBGRGZPdGJwM0FoLVMwYw</guid></item><item><title>研究检测全球月经产品中的有毒PFAS化学物质- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/study-detects-toxic-pfas-forever-chemicals-in-menstrual-products-available-worldwide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable menstrual products are meant to be the safer, greener option. A new, peer-reviewed study finds, however, that this is not always the case. Researchers found PFAS, also known as “&lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;” because of their persistence, in a range of period items and incontinence products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in various industrial and consumer products since the 1940s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are known endocrine disruptors, and the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt; links certain exposures to decreased fertility, some cancers, high cholesterol, and hormone effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-in-menstrual-products"&gt;PFAS in menstrual products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes from Graham Peaslee at the &lt;a href="https://www.nd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;. His team and collaborators screened 59 reusable products across categories, then ran targeted tests on a subset to identify specific compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual products, including underwear and reusable pads, showed the highest rates of intentional PFAS use, at 33 percent and 25 percent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS were detected in all extracted products, and the most abundant &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-plastic-food-packaging-contains-9936-harmful-chemicals/"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; were fluorotelomer alcohols 6:2 and 8:2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS come in ionic and neutral forms. Neutral PFAS lack an electrical charge, which can change how they move through materials and the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling work indicates several neutral PFAS may be absorbed through skin efficiently. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36917694/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; estimated dermal uptake for 11 neutral PFAS could exceed inhalation under certain indoor scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-found"&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team first used a rapid screen for total fluorine to spot possible intentional use. They then measured the levels of 31 ionic and 11 neutral compounds in selected items to see what was actually present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern was consistent across markets sampled from North America, South America, and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one product in every category tested showed no signs of intentional fluorination, which suggests it is possible to manufacture these items without using PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-free-menstrual-products"&gt;PFAS-free menstrual products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only a subset of the products had high levels of PFAS present, which means that PFAS must not be essential in the manufacture of reusable feminine hygiene products,” said Alyssa Wicks, the lead author and a postdoctoral assistant at &lt;a href="https://duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding matters because it shows menstrual products can be manufactured successfully without these treatments. It also means product design choices, suppliers, and coatings make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin is not an absolute barrier. The outer layer is lipid rich, and neutral compounds can partition into it, which raises reasonable concerns for long wear items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutral PFAS may also contact mucous membranes depending on the product. Data on long term uptake through vaginal tissue remain limited, so risk assessments are still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-environmental-health-implications"&gt;Environmental health implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS in menstrual products do not stay confined to the user. When these items are washed, particles and residues can move into household wastewater, which eventually connects to larger water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater plants are not designed to filter PFAS, so the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-threaten-arctic-wildlife-and-human-health/"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; can pass through treatment and return to rivers, lakes, and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the environment, PFAS can accumulate in fish and other wildlife. Studies have shown measurable levels in species that people eat, which means contamination cycles back into the food chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection links individual product use to a wider public health issue that affects whole communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-lower-pfas-exposure-today"&gt;How to lower PFAS exposure today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking water is a major route for many communities. For households on contaminated systems or wells, certified home &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanups/reducing-pfas-your-drinking-water-home-filter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt; can reduce several PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For textiles and period products, prefer options without stain or water repellence treatments. Choose brands that publish PFAS test reports for current lots, not just historical claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA set the first national drinking water &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/pfas-npdwr_fact-sheet_general_4.9.24v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; for several PFAS in April 2024. Utilities have a schedule to monitor and reduce levels, and states are aligning plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now filling key gaps on dermal absorption of neutral PFAS and on product to body transfer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardized labeling and supplier auditing will help manufacturers avoid these chemicals while maintaining leak protection and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-still-do-not-know"&gt;What we still do not know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not yet know the real world dose that is obtained from wearing PFAS-treated textiles against skin. Laboratory models and screening data point to plausible exposure, but time on body, temperature, fabric structure, and wash history all matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also do not know how neutral PFAS absorbed via this route convert or persist once &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-dietary-fiber-supplement-could-remove-pfas-forever-chemicals-from-the-body/"&gt;inside the body&lt;/a&gt;. Targeted biomonitoring paired with product testing will be needed to answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s snapshot is small but informative. It shows both the problem and the potential path forward. Reusable designs can work without PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers can reward brands that disclose materials and publish independent testing, and makers can tighten supply chains to keep fluorinated treatments out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbW96NmVSYzVrQ05yWmtwWjRVTDE2M0xWOUFzdkJPd3RoYTl0UnBlUm9Fdk5TZ0hyWVlJX1hJVnNkY3lfVlducFhYN1B3M2hjX0dYbjd3RVFzczlXX1FLSDdYRnFPSDd1VHNYWW1yNWlVRmFwdUJ2QjZ4VXhFRFVPTlVpN25hcEh6Y3p6S0d1VU0xNWZIWVhkanBkLUU2dkZuSDF4TW5RTi1jTHVUX2xYTnF3</guid></item><item><title>诊断软件使中风患者的完全康复率提高三倍-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/diagnostic-software-stroke-patients-ai-hghmzxs0s</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Half of stroke patients can now “fully recover” after the NHS introduced “revolutionary” software that allows patients to receive a diagnosis up to one hour faster compared with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Analysis from NHS England has found that the specialised AI-assisted tool has been used to interpret the brain scans of more than 60,000 patients since the roll-out last summer, as half of stroke patients now receive a diagnosis from the software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The service, available in 100 &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; stroke clinics, allows for rapid processing and interpretation of brain scans, which helps doctors to make faster decisions about treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="6afd3834-a856-4c97-81b9-b9b611780b88"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is cut off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The improved scans mean that patients can now get a diagnosis up to an hour faster than when they are diagnosed with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During a stroke, the&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; blood supply to parts of the brain is blocked or reduced, causing the brain cells to die.

This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes the prebiotic harnessed the gut-brain axis and promoted the growth of good bacteria in the intestines that reduced inflammation in the brain and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14607151/scientists-debunked-theory-cause-autism-study.html"&gt;'gut-brain axis',&lt;/a&gt; a network linking the digestive tract and the nervous system and brain, has been thought to be a key link between digestion and mental health for years, with some scientists claiming that the trillions of microbes in the intestines may influence mood, behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conducting the study in twins reduced the chances the changes observed were because of genetics, but the study was small, and scientists said it needs to be repeated in a larger group in order to support its findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study has found that two common supplements could help prevent dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic say the gut-brain axis explains everyday sensations such as 'gut feelings' or 'butterflies' in the stomach, and others suggest a balanced microbiome, or community of bacteria in the intestines, can boost brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are even suggestions an unbalanced microbiome in the gut could be linked to a higher risk of autism in children, and a higher risk of depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet many experts caution that much of the research up to this point remains preliminary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, scientists gave all participants the protein powder BCAA, sold for about 70 cents a capsule and a common supplement used to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the participants also received the prebiotic inulin, a type of fiber from roots, plus fructooligosaccharides, a type of carbohydrate found in plants and sometimes used as a low-calorie sweetener. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic supplements are readily available online and in retailers and cost about $3 a pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twins who received both the powder and prebiotic scored better on Paired Associates Learning (PAL) tests, or tests that involve matching similar images used to help recognize early signs of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests on stool samples revealed twins who received the prebiotic had higher levels of Bifidobacterium in their gut compared to those not taking the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bifidobacterium are healthy bacteria shown to boost the body's immune system, improve digestion and even potentially help those struggling with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote in their study: 'Our results demonstrate that cheap and readily available gut microbiome interventions may improve cognition in our ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To confirm our findings, a larger study which includes a range of cognitive tests, alongside measures of effect and attention, and detailed microbiome measures is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said their findings would only apply to healthy adults and not to those who had already developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at Johns Hopkins say that there is a 'second brain' in the gut, or the enteric nervous system, formed of two thin layers of more than 100million nerve cells that line the gastrointestinal tract from the throat to the rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells do not 'think' like in the brain, primarily being involved in digestion and the release of enzymes to break down food, but there is evidence that they send signals back to the brain that can trigger shifts in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have already linked this to shifts in mood in those with irritable bowel disease, a chronic bowel pain disorder, and caused by constipation or diarrhea.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition that gradually robs sufferers of their abilities to take care of themselves, speak and remember events and people in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of Americans suffering from the condition is expected to surge, according to some estimates, and jump to almost 13million by 2050, nearly double today's patient figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include forgetting names or familiar objects, becoming lost in familiar places or unexplained changes in emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the condition, but scientists have developed medications that may be able to slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cause of Alzheimer's is not clear, but studies suggest it may be linked to a build-up of proteins in the brain, or to damage to blood vessels in the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of the study, researchers also investigated whether the supplements influenced muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists suggest that the regulation of muscle growth may be controlled by key signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were asked to also complete a weight-lifting session twice per week, and do exercises including squats, calf raises and bicep curls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed no difference in muscle mass or chair rise times, the time it takes someone to get up from a chair, at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers suggested this may have been because the study was too short to show any shifts in muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Despite the new technology, the way to treat patients has remained largely the same, with doctors using stethoscopes hanging around their necks to access the internal organs of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nifty item that has been a part of a doctor's toolkit since 1816 has now received an AI-powered upgrade. The new AI stethoscope can diagnose three heart conditions—Heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and valvular heart disease (VHD)—in just 15 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the traditional stethoscope listens to sounds inside the body, like a heartbeat or breathing, the AI-powered stethoscope goes further than that and can pick up on tiny changes in the heartbeat or blood flow that a human ear would miss. Meanwhile, it can also perform a quick ECG (electrocardiogram) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new device, which is the size of a playing card, has been showcased by researchers at Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust as part of a study in the UK called TRICORDER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device can also connect via Bluetooth to a dedicated smartphone app where the captured data can be visualized. Meanwhile, it uses cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity to access cloud-based AI algorithms to work its magic.

"TB outbreaks are also uncommon in United States school settings. In any case, please note we are committed to both an individual’s right to privacy and protecting the health of all students and staff." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB is an airborne disease that typically affects the lungs but can also impact the brain, kidneys or the spine. Spending extended time in an enclosed space with someone infected is "required for TB to spread between people," according to BHSJCHA. While it is contagious, it's less so than the flu or a cold, and cannot be transferred through  shaking someone’s hand, sharing food or drink, sharing toothbrushes, sharing school supplies, kissing, touching bed linens or touching toilet seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following safety recommendations were made to the CHS community: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain, among others. These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your child have these symptoms, contact your doctor and BHSJCHA team using the information below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for further CHS and BHSJCHA communications. If you or your child is identified as being exposed to TB, be ready to complete a consent form for evaluation and testing, as well as receive notification for where and when evaluation and testing will occur.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 2021, the United States experienced a nearly 30 year decline in TB cases, including a large decline in 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recovery from pandemic-related health care disruptions, increases in post-pandemic travel and outbreaks in several states have "likely contributed" to recent upward TB trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Provisional CDC data from 2024&lt;/a&gt; shows an 8% increase in TB cases nationally from 2023 (9,622 cases in 2023 and 10,347 cases in 2024) as well as an 11% increase in Michigan (149 in 2023 and 165 in 2024). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about TB can be found &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/site.html#gen" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/site.html#gen" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:26:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxNRGpzQ1drTUc1d0E3WkxPaVhNSzc5SGlBcEZrNkp0Y0RPY1BqVnJTU25XUDVmaklDclV4M3ZDYlN3QkJtVU5LdF9PdE5iYXNfSVZ2YWJBN1VTOC05dEpPVUxpUDM2WGw2dkZVZkZuUTkweUYzazhqSGtIa1plSU5fYXJJbjcxRURtWHA5X0xEdWNfUl9ybGRwQ2t1R1M3ZVY5THFrWkFQbnozQlhtWk92UGxBV2N0bkdpeTlkSWttME1wZHB0X1VOUWFMdW5BWjJvSE9MZEt4UDlucWxaRWozNTVxX0lSN2k3cy1vWWpjMkxRMFFLb1p0cDZJUlEwRHJWM1A2QzkxVGpxNjlX</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症会破坏避免不愉快事件的学习-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/depression-learning-avoidance-29648/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Depression specifically impairs the ability to learn how to actively avoid unpleasant events, though it does not affect avoidance behavior once learned. Researchers tested 465 participants across a range of depressive symptoms in a task adapted from rodent research, involving sounds and visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with more severe symptoms had difficulty at the learning stage but eventually performed at the same level as others once they acquired the skill. The findings suggest depression may uniquely affect the acquisition of avoidance learning rather than avoidance itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Impairment:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression interferes with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Catches Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Once tasks are learned, depressed individuals perform as well as others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers aim to test how depression affects avoidance in complex or long-term contexts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression alters how people pursue rewards, but, conversely, whether depressive symptoms influence how people learn to avoid nonrewarding, unpleasant events is less clear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Tomm and colleagues, from the University of British Colombia, addressed this question in their &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt; paper to shed more light on the relationship between depression and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work brought together researchers from preclinical, cognitive, and clinical backgrounds, building stronger connections across fields to better understand the mechanisms of depression.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a behavioral task for study volunteers based off rodent research that involves participants listening to sounds while looking at a screen with visual cues signaling sounds to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants learned to avoid unpleasant sounds either by actively responding or withholding responses to cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a sample of 465 participants with a wide range of depressive symptoms from low to severe, the researchers found that people with more severe symptoms struggled to learn to actively avoid aversive sounds compared to those with less severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once they did learn the task, their ability to actively avoid unpleasant sounds matched those with less symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to the authors, depressive symptoms may interfere specifically with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events, rather than with avoidance more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we still don’t know,” says Tomm, “is how depressive symptoms affect avoidance when people continue to learn after being proficient at an avoidance task, or in more complex situations where the best way to avoid something is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we actively explore these questions, we hope our work will provide a deeper understanding of how depression shapes avoidance behavior across different contexts.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0ada5a4a9a180b3a6aeeeafb2a7ada5a4a9a180b3a6aeeeafb2a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Antibiotics are great, they are miracles in severe bacterial infections where they can be life-saving,' Dr. Van Groningen explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know that antibiotic use is the number one factor for developing C.diff, or C. difficile infections, which can be absolutely terrible if you have seen or heard or read about these,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;C. diff is a type of bacteria that infects your colon, per &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15548-c-diff-infection"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and is extremely contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr. Van Groningen said that even if you don't develop C.diff from antibiotic use, it can heavily interfere with your gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In fact, there are a couple of recent studies that have shown that antibiotic use has been associated with a modest &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7377039/Some-antibiotics-linked-higher-risk-colon-cancer.html"&gt;increased risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,' Dr. Van Groningen said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is postulated that one of the possible causative explanations for this could be the alteration in gut microbiome that comes along with antibiotic use,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Again, great drug for the right purpose, but I wouldn't use it just because.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another great example of a fantastic medication used in the acute setting for an allergic reaction, a rash, can be fantastic, but it is not meant to be used in the long term,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cited that there have been a few studies that found a link between long-term &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14918501/benadryl-crippling-disease-warning.html"&gt;Benadryl use and dementia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Plus, the long list of side effects, especially in older adults, can be quite burdensome,' she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the side effects that the doctor named were sedation, constipation, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just not great as a long-term option,' she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is not something that I think we should be doing when we have time, it is the cornerstone of our health,' she stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9491791/Lack-SLEEP-increase-risk-dementia-study-finds.html"&gt;so many different studies&lt;/a&gt; that link chronic sleep deprivation with an increased risk of a multitude of chronic diseases, everything from dementia to cardiovascular disease,' the doctor shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that on a long-term basis, it's important to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:05:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQNmdTdmp3VkhEX1hVQnZ6OVZ5NUFfQzY1YURrQnRLQlY2VndXdEZDOEZJSUhfek4tcE1rUkNHSFFLb1BkZ0ZUQkY2Y1VZX2ZXbUk4MGRpZ2dBaExQODd1MnBLNEZiRUdsb0FncTNuQjNiMk9Ha0I2RXF1Wk9lRDI1UGZqeWRlSTRqM0V2c0VxaUlEUDN3Wng1RtIBngFBVV95cUxOMUd0eldDeUtaZHoxMEEzZy1oZXc4TTc2THMzY2Z2QjRQQU56QkVkb2UwcFFSamZQTXBnUWlSeDlNeXkycFlOQ1p6cmxRWkRlN1hzci1fNlVOajctR3hzbXM5U3piZDJUbDNNYkZJTG1YVmFtM2VPZUdTNjNPQUJfYXdkMkhSNUU0czNDX0pfLUszMExveXdkN3k4dDcwQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁以上的每个人都应该做的4项基本练习，以保持终身强壮-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/essential-exercises-stay-strong-after-40/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Once you reach the 40 milestone, building and maintaining your strength becomes more important than ever. Staying strong as you age will help you remain independent, protect your joints, and keep your body fit and functional for decades to come. However, with all the information online, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. That’s why we chatted with &lt;b&gt;Amanda Dvorak, CPT&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/amandadvorak" target="_blank"&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, who shares her four essential exercises that those over 40 should do to stay strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular strength training can help you maintain (and even build) muscle well into your later years. According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, resistance training in older adults can help slow natural muscle loss that occurs with aging while also improving mobility, reducing fall risk, and boosting quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;These four key exercises are ultra-effective as they’re easy to modify, require little or no equipment, and engage multiple muscle groups at once. This means you can get plenty of benefits in a short amount of time, whether you’re at home, traveling, or in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s exactly how to perform each one, along with tips for proper form, reps, and sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone looking to get stronger, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-squats-to-see-results-after-40/"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt; are an absolute must. They strengthen your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039033/" target="_blank"&gt;glutes&lt;/a&gt;, quads, hamstrings, and core, all of which are crucial for walking, climbing stairs, and standing up from a seated position. Plus, stronger legs mean more stability and less risk of falls as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Squats are one of the best ways to maintain lower body strength and mobility,” Dvorak says. “They keep your hips, knees, and ankles working together, which helps with balance and everyday movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly turned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your chest tall and core tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees and push your hips back as if sitting into a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor (or as low as you can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to the standing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; As you get stronger, you can hold light dumbbells or a kettlebell for added resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classic &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-build-strength-after-50/"&gt;bodyweight exercise&lt;/a&gt; has stood the test of time for a reason: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/push-ups-elite-upper-body-strength-trainers/"&gt;Pushups&lt;/a&gt; develop upper-body pushing strength and core stability. “Pushups build strength in your chest, shoulders, arms, and core. They’re also easy to modify by dropping to your knees if needed or elevating your hands,” Dvorak explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor while keeping them at about a 45-degree angle from your torso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modification:&lt;/b&gt; If regular pushups are too difficult, perform them on your knees or with your hands on an elevated surface, such as a bench or countertop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rows are a pulling exercise that strengthens the muscles between your shoulder blades, lats, and biceps. They’re essential for balancing the front-to-back strength of your upper body, which &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/is-it-too-late-to-save-your-posture" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; says can help counteract the rounded posture many people develop from sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether with resistance bands or a suspension trainer, rows pull your shoulders back and strengthen your upper back and arms,” Dvorak says. “This helps fight poor posture and keeps your shoulder joints healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it (band version):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor a resistance band to a secure object at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the ends with your palms facing each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back to create light tension in the band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the band toward your ribcage, squeezing your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears throughout the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-variations-for-six-pack/"&gt;Planks&lt;/a&gt; are a highly effective isometric exercise, meaning you hold the position instead of moving. They engage your deep core muscles, glutes, shoulders, and back, training them to work together to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12155697/" target="_blank"&gt;stabilize your spine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Planks challenge your core in a way that helps prevent back pain and improves posture,” Dvorak explains. “They also build full-body tension and stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie face down and place your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your body off the floor so you’re supported on your forearms and toes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body flexed to avoid sagging or piking at your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Time:&lt;/b&gt; Start with 3 sets of 20 to 30-second planks, working up to 60 seconds per set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four exercises work all the major muscle groups and support the movement patterns you use every day. For a simple, effective full-body workout, perform them in a circuit like so:&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squats: 10 to 15 reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushups: 8 to 12 reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rows: 10 to 15 reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plank: 20 to 60-second hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest for 30 to 60 seconds between exercises and repeat the full circuit three or four times. If you stay consistent with this routine, you’ll significantly increase your chances of staying strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1960742897201872969" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said on X&lt;/a&gt; that the shots will remain available to all who want them after consulting with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fd4s9"&gt;But the new guidance represents a growing rift between the federal government and professional medical groups when it comes to vaccine recommendations, and how doctors respond may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bd64o"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/3/e2022058700/188297/?_gl=1*1sdvz7s*_ga*MTM3ODc0NzkxMi4xNzU2MzIwNTM0*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTY2NTEzODQkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTY2NTMxNDgkajUxJGwwJGgw*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NTY2NTEzODUuQ2owS0NRanc1Y19GQmhESkFSSXNBSWNtSEs5dHk2TzFDVW1VZnlDSHBOaHZ5VjdEb0lURENFVVhZOUFyRXBRTTNNSWdsSkFYUW1VQUJ4c2FBbk1CRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTE5NDA3NDc0NS4xNzU2NjUxMzg0*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTY2NTEzODQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTY2NTMxNDgkajYwJGwwJGgw" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommends COVID shots&lt;/a&gt; for children over six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bie7h"&gt;COVID vaccines are not required for kids to attend school in New York, but Sessions said some parents still ask about them.

Students need to get immunized against preventable diseases like measles, chicken pox, whooping cough and polio, depending on what grade they’re entering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="357km"&gt;Students in public, private and religious schools have to show proof they’ve gotten all the shots required for their age groups within 14 days of the start of school or day care each fall, unless they can show they have medical exemptions. Students arriving from outside of the state or country can be given grace periods of up to 30 days, according to &lt;a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/guidance-to-schools-on-immunization-compliance.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guidance to schools&lt;/a&gt; from the New York City Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6hgg6"&gt;“Vaccination is an important part of keeping our schools healthy, and vaccination guidance has been distributed to families," said Jenna Lyle, a spokesperson for the city education department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5gk4q"&gt;New York state has &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;among the strictest&lt;/a&gt; school vaccination laws in the country, since former Gov. Andrew Cuomo eliminated the option of religious exemptions for vaccination in 2019 following a major measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="45gmm"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do New York kindergartners compare to the rest of the country on vaccine coverage?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7t8c0"&gt;During the last school year, vaccine coverage among kindergartners &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;decreased nationally&lt;/a&gt; for all vaccines tracked by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, the agency found that the share of kindergartners claiming exemptions increased in most states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7e4ub"&gt;However, the data shows New York’s vaccine coverage remained among the strongest in the country, largely because kindergartners were not taking advantage of vaccine exemptions at the rates they were in many other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3hr36"&gt;In New York, 97.8% of kindergartners received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, above the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. Statewide, 0.3% of kindergartners claimed any vaccine exemption last school year, up from 0.1% the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="9ns8r"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about vaccination rates among younger kids?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d8bmo"&gt;City data on vaccine coverage among 2-year-olds shows rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/childhood-vaccination-data.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trending upward&lt;/a&gt; in recent years for most types of shots, although uptake for some vaccines is better than others — and rates can vary widely by neighborhood. Citywide, 95% of 2-year-olds had gotten at least one dose of their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines last year, up from 87% in 2020. But in parts of the city, the rate remains low. In the Central Harlem ZIP code 10039, just 58% of 2-year-olds got at least one dose of the MMR vaccine last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9pl9t"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department, said routine medical care was disrupted during the pandemic, negatively affecting vaccination rates, and the increase in overall vaccination rates among young children indicates a reversal of that trend. She said the city is also working to share and discuss vaccination rates with individual health care providers to improve coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cn9sf"&gt;Citywide, vaccination against the flu has declined among all children under 18 in recent years, city data shows. The flu vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/health-and-wellness/immunizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only required&lt;/a&gt; in the city for children attending pre-K or day care, according to guidance from the city Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="c9knl"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could federal policy changes influence New York’s school vaccine requirements?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cklhb"&gt;Federal public health changes have stirred up some uncertainty about the future. New York state bases its school vaccine requirements on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f20oh"&gt;Kennedy’s recent overhaul of the committee has prompted concerns about whether members will continue to base their recommendations in science, and some professional medical groups &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-acog-recommendations" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have started issuing&lt;/a&gt; their own recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="aeiv3"&gt;“Should changes to ACIP’s composition lead to substantial shifts in its recommendations, the department will carefully evaluate those changes and assess any implications for public health policy in New York,” Dr. James McDonald, the state health commissioner, told Gothamist in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ar9gr"&gt;Danielle DeSouza, a spokesperson for the state health department, said last week the agency continues to monitor federal vaccine messaging and recommendations and “do what is best to protect public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="42e6s"&gt;Sessions said pediatricians are “really following American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations right now, and we're looking to them as sort of our guiding light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ckfo6"&gt;But health care providers say challenges could arise if future changes in vaccine recommendations affect which shots are covered by insurance or provided to doctors by the federal Vaccines for Children Program, which provides vaccines at no cost to eligible kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="19ktj"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will flu shots be available as usual this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4h1fn"&gt;ACIP raised some eyebrows among medical groups when it &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-recommends-flu-vaccines-thimerosal/story?id=123224218" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advised against&lt;/a&gt; formulations of the flu vaccine that contain a preservative known as thimerosal in June.

    &lt;p&gt;Autism is often thought of as a childhood condition, but this is far from true. Autism is a lifelong condition – &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00045-5/fulltext"&gt;and most autistic people are adults&lt;/a&gt;. Yet &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2021.0041"&gt;less than 1% of autism research&lt;/a&gt; has focused on older autistic people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we know very little about the needs of autistic people are they grow older – and whether they face unique health challenges as they age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to better understand what the current evidence tells us about autism in midlife and old age, a colleague and I recently conducted a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-111323-090813"&gt;narrative review&lt;/a&gt; of more than 70 published papers from across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed that autistic people are more likely to face poorer health outcomes in midlife and old age compared to their non-autistic peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our review found that the &lt;a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism"&gt;core characteristics of autism&lt;/a&gt; (such as differences in communication, repetitive behaviours and dedicated interests) remain relatively stable into later adulthood – although there’s some variability in individual experiences. For example, some autistic people find that their senses &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2024.0031"&gt;become more sensitive&lt;/a&gt; as they age, while others don’t find this to be the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those diagnosed with autism later in life, receiving this diagnosis often proved life-changing – giving them greater self-understanding and acceptance of themselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More health-related difficulties&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health problems are a major concern for autistic people as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that autistic people are more likely to experience most &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361319890793"&gt;physical and mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; than their non-autistic peers. This included greater risk of being diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression and other age-related conditions such as osteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our review also revealed that autistic adults may be more likely to experience more complex health problems. For instance, one study showed autistic people were more likely to be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-abstract/76/9/1726/5881354?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;multiple mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those in midlife, menopause is a challenging transition. Many autistic people reported experiencing more severe physical and psychological menopause symptoms compared to non-autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also uncovered evidence that found &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00195-3/fulltext"&gt;life expectancy may be lower&lt;/a&gt; in autistic adults compared to non-autistic people. This is often linked to conditions such as epilepsy and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31238998/"&gt;high rates of suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many autistic people also encountered barriers in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13623613241291081"&gt;accessing physical and mental healthcare and support&lt;/a&gt; – often because services lacked autism awareness. This further contributed to poorer health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A mixed picture for cognitive health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence was rather mixed when it came to cognitive abilities in midlife and old age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some autistic adults maintain strong cognitive skills in later life. But others struggle with memory and executive function (thinking and planning), which are important cognitive skills in day-to-day living. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hands-two-elderly-people-home-playing-1968280954"&gt;Lucigerma/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many autistic people will cognitively age in a similar way to non-autistic people, there’s some evidence that autistic adults may face a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03045-6"&gt;higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, more large-scale research is needed to better understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The importance of social support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies consistently found that autistic adults report lower quality of life compared to non-autistic peers. Mental health difficulties play a significant role in lower quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key factor here appears to be social support. Our review found that autistic adults who had &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35362329/"&gt;strong social networks&lt;/a&gt; reported higher quality of life – while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reia.2025.202533"&gt;loneliness and isolation&lt;/a&gt; were linked to poorer wellbeing. This could be because many autistic adults report having &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/27546330241245529"&gt;fewer social connections&lt;/a&gt; and experiencing greater isolation – particularly men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found that factors such as receiving their autism diagnosis, learning to manage their capacity for social interactions and being in social situations and maintaining autonomy play important roles in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00142-0"&gt;positively shaping quality of life&lt;/a&gt; as autistic people get older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Important considerations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about the findings of this review, it’s important to recognise limitations in the current research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a small fraction of autism research has actually investigated ageing and autism. And what published literature has been done of this topic has focused on those diagnosed in adulthood. This overlooks a lot of autistic people. People who are diagnosed with autism in childhood and those with intellectual disabilities or higher support needs, are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30867896/"&gt;often excluded from research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under-diagnosis of autism is another major issue. Although autism affects &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(24)00363-8/fulltext"&gt;around 1% of the global population&lt;/a&gt;, health records in the UK show &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00045-5/fulltext"&gt;very low diagnosis rates&lt;/a&gt; among middle-aged and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates also suggest that around 89% of autistic people aged 40–59, and 97% of those aged 60 or over, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-devpsych-111323-090813"&gt;may be undiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. This is, in part, due to autism &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13176"&gt;historically being viewed&lt;/a&gt; as a condition that only affected children. Additionally, gender biases in autism diagnoses were common – resulting in women and girls being historically overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, we need more studies that track autistic people and their experiences throughout their life – including as they get older. We also need to make sure research is representative of autistic people more broadly – for example, by including people with higher support needs and those diagnosed earlier in life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, autistic adults themselves must be involved in steering the direction of research and the creation of resources and policies. With their input, we can support healthier, more fulfilling and socially connected lives, so they are able to age well with dignity and autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ageing in autistic people has been historically overlooked, we’re making a lot of progress in addressing this major gap in research. While the current evidence included in our review has identified a lot of challenges that middle-aged and older autistic people might face, it has also highlighted opportunities for where autistic people can be better supported as they get older – such as improving access to healthcare and helping people remain socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of autism in midlife and later life, we can begin to reduce the health risks that autistic adults face as they age and improve wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Speaking at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that millions of children could face ill health in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said: “I worry that vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become more stiff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said. Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Løchen cited a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When e-cigarettes heat liquids to higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also know that when children and young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk of irreversible harm to their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that. It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to cardiovascular risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a moment too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data on the long-term health effects is limited because vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban on sales of e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think based on what we know now about the detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15, 20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 16:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQR09udWVWT005WUJ1NUw2VmVTeU5RNnpCV0FUM2Rvb1JNb01rd2lrLWtCSDFSVDU5M1Rac3JMX0FGb0NBUDBCV3dBcl9VVDlZU3MtV1hYZ2l0OXNCa21yYkNOS0lQd0pPQ1dYelNNOUZCR2hDb1pHOW5DeHJIUE5fU3dja0tITmdsZHNacEhRVTdJXzl3M19zYVJ5VlZhZkVRYWFIOEJ4X2txczFuZjlZaA</guid></item><item><title>可以偷走阿司匹林冠冕的预防心脏病发作的药物-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/the-heart-attack-preventing-drug-that-could-steal-aspirins-crown-fwxsbkrb7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Aspirin has been one of the most widely used medicines around the world for more than a century, most recently in low-dose form as a treatment for cardiovascular problems such as a heart attack or a stroke. However, its reign has been challenged by more recent drugs, and new research published in The Lancet could see it &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;lose its crown to a younger pretender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers analysing clinical trials involving nearly 30,000 people with coronary artery disease — which can include those who’ve had a heart attack or suffer from angina — found that a low dose of aspirin doesn’t offer as much protection as the newer antiplatelet (blood-thinning) drug clopidogrel. A finding that could change UK guidelines which, at least for most people with&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; coronary artery disease, advocate taking a daily aspirin for the rest of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel may be the newer of the two drugs but it has been in use since the late Nineties and is the medicine of choice for preventing recurrent problems in most people who have had a stroke, or who have “furred-up” arteries in their legs. However, aspirin remains the standard long-term preventive for people with coronary artery disease. For now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both medicines work by reducing the stickiness of platelets, the smallest components of blood that clump together after injury to help to form clots and stem bleeding. A potentially life-saving physiological response if you are involved in a road traffic accident or undergoing surgery, but a potentially fatal one if the platelets happen to be activated in a narrow blood vessel supplying your heart or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The use of antiplatelet medicines took off in the UK after the publication in 1988 of the landmark ISIS-2 trial, which found that daily low-dose aspirin was a life-saver for people who had a heart attack. It indicated that one month of taking the drug prevented 25 deaths, and another 10-15 non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, for every 1,000 people. And the longer they took the aspirin the greater the benefit. It was game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel was licensed about a decade after the ISIS-2 trial and was initially mainly used as a substitute for people who couldn’t take aspirin. It has a different mechanism of action (see below) but the net effect — reduced platelet “stickiness” — is much the same. Indeed, these days the drugs are often used together, at least in the short to medium term, after a heart attack, coronary artery bypass surgery, stenting and heart valve surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, as well as preventing unwanted clots in arterial bottlenecks the drugs can prevent useful clots and lead to troublesome bleeding: anything from bruising after a trivial knock or shaving nicks that won’t stop oozing to life-threatening haemorrhage in some cases. Reassuringly the Lancet paper shows that while clopidogrel is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks (and strokes) in most people with coronary artery disease, it carries no extra risk of these types of dangerous bleeding. It is often the preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/asperin-clopidogrel-heart-disease-bbzffpzt5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switching aspirin for alternative drug ‘reduces risk of heart attack’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If, as expected, guidance is changed to favour clopidogrel, millions more will end up on the drug (more than a third of people over 65 in the UK take a daily low-dose aspirin at present), but there are a couple of flies in the ointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;First, a person’s response to clopidogrel can be affected by their genetic make up, with about 30 per cent of those with European ancestry (and 50 per cent of those with east Asian ancestry) having genes that render the drug less effective. However, the researchers behind the Lancet study concluded that while it may reduce efficacy in acute treatment, such as in the days or weeks after developing heart problems, there is less evidence that it significantly impairs longer-term prevention for most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Second, the commonly prescribed anti-stomach acid medication omeprazole, and its sister drug esomeprazole, can reduce clopidogrel’s efficacy. The latest evidence suggests this may not be as worrying as initially thought, but the combination is still best avoided. Lansoprazole, another popular member of the same family of acid-suppressing drugs, is deemed a safer choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Unlike aspirin, clopidogrel is prescription-only, so people will not be able to self-medicate. Fewer people self-treat with daily low-dose aspirin than used to, but I still come across healthy middle-aged people who buy it over the counter to ward off an early heart attack or stroke. However, the evidence is clear: if you are not at higher than normal risk of stroke or heart attack, the risks of aspirin (mainly bleeding) are likely to outweigh the benefits. Take an antiplatelet medicine only if advised to do so by your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oh, and it is clo-pid-o-grill.

This effect lasts for the whole seven to ten-day life of the platelets and wanes only when they are replaced by new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Clopidogrel binds to a receptor on the surface of platelets (called P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate) but the result is much the same. And, like aspirin, the inhibition is irreversible and lasts the life of the platelet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other antiplatelet drugs include ticagrelor, prasugrel and dipyridamole.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A major study has identified the additives in ultraprocessed food most linked to an early death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found modified oil, protein source, and fibre had no significant association with risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the journal eClinicalMedicine, they wrote: 'To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has assessed associations of such a broad range of MUP categories and specific MUPs with all-cause mortality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used data from the UK Bio-bank, which tracked adults between 2006 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of participants was 57, and 57 percent of the cohort were female and 43 per cent male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found on average a fifth of participants' food intake was made up of UPF—food that contains more than one ingredient you rarely find in a domestic kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When they followed up with them after 11 years, the found 10,203 participants had since died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their analysis revealed that as UPF intake rose above 18 per cent, the risk of dying increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors cautioned that consumption data in the study was self-reported and not independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;These ultra-processed food markers can often be found in breads, biscuits, crisps and cakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nevertheless, previous studies have linked UPFs to obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers and an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And just last month, research eating too many UPFs could be stopping you from losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;British scientists who tracked dozens of adults found those who avoided UPFs, lost twice as much weight as those who often consumed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sticking to meals cooked from scratch could also help curb food cravings, but UPFs had little impact on blood pressure, heart rate, liver function and cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They argued their findings echoed calls to limit certain types of UPFs but cautioned it also showed not all UPFs are 'inherently unhealthy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Samuel Dicken, from University College London, study co-author, said: 'We saw significantly greater weight loss on the minimally processed food diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-ef5a3e00-8744-11f0-b943-7310ff2ac219" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15054609/Longevity-experts-food-additives-worst-health.html"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus was shown to cause autism-like behaviors in mice. Drugs that reduce this activity reversed the symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/stanford-university/"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt; studying the neurological basis of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;autism spectrum disorder&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social communication, repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities. The spectrum includes a wide range of abilities and symptoms, which can vary significantly between individuals. The exact causes of ASD are complex and involve both genetic and environmental factors.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/span&gt; have found that excessive activity in a particular brain region may be responsible for driving behaviors commonly linked to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of autism, the team identified the reticular thalamic nucleus, a structure that filters sensory information between the thalamus and cortex, as a promising treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, they showed that administering drugs to dampen activity in this brain region reversed autism-like symptoms in the mice, including seizure susceptibility, heightened sensitivity to stimuli, increased motor activity, repetitive actions, and reduced social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shared pathways with epilepsy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These same drugs are also under investigation as potential treatments for epilepsy, underscoring how the mechanisms that drive autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy may intersect in the brain and help explain why the two conditions often appear in the same individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;Science Advances&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;em&amp;amp;gt;Science Advances&amp;amp;lt;/em&amp;amp;gt; is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). It covers a broad range of disciplines including biology, physics, social sciences, and engineering. The journal emphasizes impactful, interdisciplinary research with wide relevance.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The senior author of the study is John Huguenard, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences. The lead author is Sung-Soo Jang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in neurology and neurological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connections between the thalamus and cortex have been linked to autism in both people and animal models, but the specific contribution of the reticular thalamic nucleus had remained uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers recorded the neural activity of this brain region in mice while observing the animals’ behavior. In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population — 30% versus 1% — though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings highlight the reticular thalamic nucleus as a novel target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
