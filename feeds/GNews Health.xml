            As I push my cart into my favorite grocery store, I stop and look at the shoppers — my neighbors — around me. Do they realize that nearly &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/hhs-fda-and-usda-address-health-risks-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;70% of the food&lt;/a&gt; available to purchase for their families is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt;? And if they did, would they know how to avoid those foods?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000k3b6nxmpsncs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’ve been trying to answer that question for more than two years now, as part of my beat for the CNN Wellness team. Not only does my team report on the latest lifestyle news, we also provide expert-vetted guidance on how to improve your health —  we like to say it’s “news you can use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000l3b6nox73futj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after reading countless studies, talking to dozens of experts and exploring all sorts of trendy apps, I still can’t help you &lt;em&gt;reliably&lt;/em&gt; avoid ultraprocessed foods, also known as UPFs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000m3b6n5fwlwser@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Come with me to the snack aisle, and I’ll explain why.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000n3b6nhcwyhjsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As I pass by all the colorfully packaged candies, cookies and chips, my stomach starts to rumble with anticipation. Typically made of refined grains and overflowing with sugar, salt and fat, these products — which we used to call “junk foods” — are calorie-laden, nutritionally bad for us, and deliciously addictive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000o3b6ndbetrfr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The appeal of junk food hasn’t changed — in fact, experts say it’s only gotten worse as the food industry &lt;a href="https://stateofchildhoodobesity.org/sugary-drinks-and-tobacco-different-industries-same-playbook/#:~:text=According%20to%20Kelly%20Brownell%2C%20PhD%2C%20and%20Matthew,tobacco%20and%20food%20industries%20have%20decades%2Dlong%20connections." target="_blank"&gt;refined its algorithms&lt;/a&gt; to target our “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/health/bliss-point-addictive-food"&gt;bliss point”&lt;/a&gt; — creating the absolute &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6550161/" target="_blank"&gt;yummiest combinations&lt;/a&gt; of sugar, salt and fat to make it nearly impossible to “eat just one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000p3b6nyhlsw0xq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;many of those same junk foods — as well as the majority of other ultraprocessed foods such as ready-to-eat meals, processed meats, instant and boxed mixes, breakfast cereals, and more — contain newly created synthetic favors, textures, dyes and preservatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000q3b6n7p1c5xnf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, today’s preservatives can keep foods looking fresh and tasty for days and weeks, even years — much longer shelf lives than in your great granny’s day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000r3b6n0uuqis7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s no doubt that the safety and convenience of such long-lasting, affordable foods has been life-changing. Today, we can make meals from our cabinets without stopping by the store for fresh ingredients or stirring sauce for hours over the stove. We have more of our precious time to spend on other pursuits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000s3b6nh4ztevfm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet it’s those preservatives and other additives, however, that can make a food ultraprocessed, according to the food classification system &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10261019/" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA,&lt;/a&gt; the most widely used definition of UPFs to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000t3b6nsa4ljt63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NOVA was &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/nutrition-and-health-the-issue-is-not-food-nor-nutrients-so-muchas-processing/0C514FC9DB264538F83D5D34A81BB10A" target="_blank"&gt;created in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Augusto Monteiro,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who coined the term “ultraprocessed.” Monteiro is an emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil’s University of São Paulo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000u3b6nzwm5vwr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NOVA splits food into four categories. First are  &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/weight-loss-ultraprocessed-food-wellness"&gt;minimally processed&lt;/a&gt; foods — whole foods which we may slightly “process” by cutting (slicing up an orange or apple) and cooking (sautéing vegetables). The second group includes processed culinary items used to prepare, season and cook whole foods — think spices, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned or bottled veggies and fruits, salted nuts, and unpackaged, freshly baked breads are examples.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000v3b6n3uo2dcp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Group four are ultraprocessed foods — which now make up to 53% of an American adult’s diet and 62% of foods eaten by an American child, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/health/ultraprocessed-food-calories-average-diet-wellness"&gt;a recent report&lt;/a&gt; by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000w3b6nrtd92o9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Monteiro, the products in group four contain little to no whole food. Instead, they are manufactured from “chemically manipulated &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" target="_blank"&gt;cheap ingredients&lt;/a&gt;” and often use synthetic additives to make them “edible, palatable and habit-forming.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000x3b6ngzi7wfre@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additives often used in ultraprocessed foods include preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness"&gt;artificial colorings&lt;/a&gt;; fragrance and flavor enhancers; and anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000y3b6n26gf0jtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products,” Monteiro  cowrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" target="_blank"&gt;2024 editorial in the journal The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;. “The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde000z3b6na9kq87tw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The stakes are high: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that eating just 10% more calories a day from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-cancer-wellness/index.html"&gt;ultraprocessed food&lt;/a&gt; — that’s about one serving — may be associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;50% higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease-related death. There is also a 55% greater chance of obesity and a 40% higher probability of developing type 2 diabetes. The risk of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive decline and stroke&lt;/a&gt; also rises, as does the chance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-cancer-wellness/index.html"&gt;developing cancers&lt;/a&gt; of the upper digestive tract.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00103b6n7qad1tso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents major food manufacturers, told me in an email “there is currently no agreed upon scientific definition of ultra-processed foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00113b6nsomxpp2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” said Sarah Gallo, CBA’s senior vice president of product policy. “Americans deserve facts based on sound science in order to make the best choices for their health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00123b6n4nyo6y4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, she said, food and beverage manufacturers have long invested in product labeling, “so that consumers can review product ingredients and nutrition information and make decisions best for them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00133b6njujkc39t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To manufacture cheap, delicious food that is packaged for convenience, experts say basic food crops such as potatoes, corn, wheat and soybeans may be disassembled into their molecular parts — starchy flours, protein isolates, fats and oils — to create what manufacturers call “slurries.” (How do they do it?  &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKsrCGfxLY" target="_blank"&gt;Watch this video.&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00143b6nbub2x0tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cell&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;walls of the plants are destroyed, dispersing micronutrients that often need to work together to nurture our bodies. Insoluble &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/10/health/high-fiber-diet-weight-loss-mortality-study-intl"&gt;plant fiber&lt;/a&gt; we need to be healthy may also &lt;a href="https://www.cspi.org/article/high-fiber-foods-ultra-processed-pretenders-what-know" target="_blank"&gt;be lost&lt;/a&gt;. What’s left is a substance some scientists call “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness"&gt;predigested&lt;/a&gt;” — not unlike the regurgitated food a mama bird feeds her babies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00153b6nzr7utecv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Barry Popkin, the W.R. Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, has seen the process firsthand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00163b6nt3px83m2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the early 2000s, I went into some food plants and I saw the stuff — it was supposed to be granola bars, shredded wheat cereal,” Popkin said. “It was colorless, odorless. I scooped some up in a spoon and tried to taste it — it was like sawdust or something.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00173b6n4q1rdmkd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why eating “predigested” food can be a problem: When we eat whole foods as our bodies are meant to do, we absorb micronutrients throughout the entire digestive process. If they are exploded into smithereens in an ultraprocessed food, do we still have access to them? If we do, are they absorbed by the body in the ways nature meant them to be?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00183b6n3tsoljqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m not aware of any studies that answer that question, although research is underway. But according to some food scientists I’ve spoken to, it doesn’t matter — manufacturers just add back missing vitamins, fiber and protein during manufacturing and voilà! It’s as good as new.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00193b6nleu4wng0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Or is it? Is a patched-up Humpty Dumpty really the same Dumpty that fell off the wall?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001a3b6nyn1c2bhr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s get back to the slurries: Next, with the help of artificial colorings, flavorings, texturizers and glue-like emulsifiers, ingredients are mixed, heated, pounded, shaped or extruded into any food a manufacturer can dream up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001b3b6njp8au3qt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s an illusion of food,” Dr. Chris van Tulleken told me &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness"&gt;last year.&lt;/a&gt;  He is a BBC contributor and professor of infection and global health at University College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001c3b6n7n0sshmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them into molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want,” said van Tulleken, author of the 2023 book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Processed-People-Cant-Stop-Eating/dp/1324076267" target="_blank"&gt;Ultra-Processed People&lt;/a&gt;: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn’t Food … and Why Can’t We Stop?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001d3b6nbb42n16l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m still wandering around the snack aisle, so let’s put our knowledge to the test by looking at one of my kids’ old favorites — ranch-flavored veggie straws. As a conscientious mom, I always reached for the organic version.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001e3b6ny3pe1vsh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the more than 30 ingredients, three are additives: sodium caseinate, used as an emulsifier; calcium chloride, which extends shelf life; and potassium chloride, a flavor enhancer used to treat low blood pressure and low potassium levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001f3b6n28jra10y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All are designated GRAS (&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/health/food-supply-safety-loopholes-wellness"&gt;generally regarded as safe&lt;/a&gt;) for use in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Yet by NOVA’s standards, those veggie straws are definitely ultraprocessed.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001g3b6njp87d70s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s look at the nutrition label. The top ingredient is potato starch, followed by potato powder. Then come various oils, dehydrated vegetable powders (such as bell peppers, carrots, spinach), turmeric and beetroot powders (for color), and dried milk products (for the ranch taste). There are some vitamins and minerals. Oh, and salt and sugar, of course.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001h3b6n6rtu9zzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            None of that sounds dangerous, but all those powders? That’s a red flag that these kid-friendly straws may not have been made from my “Mom” vision of sautéed veggies pureed in a blender, poured into a mold and baked until puffy. Instead, it’s possible they were created from a potato-based sludge, colored and flavored with vegetable powders, and enriched with vitamins before being squeezed through a tube and baked.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001i3b6ni71kk8i7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s something scientists can’t determine. In fact, none of us can, because how these foods are made is proprietary to each manufacturer, which closely guards recipes and “bliss point” algorithms from competitors and the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001j3b6ngw2fnsb4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I tried to obtain access to a major food company’s production site on several occasions to understand how potato chips and other foods are made. Six months later, I gave up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001k3b6ns8ged0rc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Food companies today, they’ve closed off their processing plants,” Popkin said. “So we’ve never been able to have a clinical study studying what happens if you eat real corn versus deconstructed corn.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001l3b6n5n36zzj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But wait — I buy organic versions of the veggie straws, doesn’t that help? Unfortunately, no. Buying organic does reduce pesticide levels, but that’s not part of ultraprocessing. Turning even an organic vegetable into refined flakes and powders may destroy the plant’s food matrix — cell walls that hold nutrients — and like our Humpty Dumpty, that food must be put back together again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many experts have tried to simplify the chore of avoiding ultraprocessing by advising consumers to choose foods with no more than five ingredients or avoid foods with ingredients you can’t pronounce or can’t find at home.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001n3b6n2tgqodqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those are great suggestions if you have time to read labels. It’s also not a complete solution. Let’s look at my favorite potato chip, which only has three ingredients on the label: potatoes, salt and oil. Does that mean this potato chip is now good for me? Or is it still a junk food even though it isn’t ultraprocessed by the NOVA definition?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001o3b6nikvrvi5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those convenient, kid-friendly frozen chicken nuggets are easy to identify as ultraprocessed. And here’s a startling fact: Nuggets typically contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8537092/" target="_blank"&gt;transglutaminase,&lt;/a&gt; which the industry calls “meat glue.” It’s an enzyme that helps combine parts of an animal or different animals into one product — hot dogs, sausages and deli meats are common examples. (Hint: If the food packaging reads “formed” or “reformed,” it likely contains transglutaminase.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001p3b6nzqngyr8e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Transglutaminase isn’t easy to pronounce, and it’s not an ingredient you’ll have at home. Yet the &lt;a href="https://ific.org/resources/articles/what-is-transglutaminase/" target="_blank"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/Is-Transglutaminase-Enzyme-TG-Enzyme-Safe#:~:text=Yes%2C%20Transglutaminase%20Enzyme%20(TG%20enzyme,products%20for%20over%2010%20years." target="_blank"&gt;US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; have no problem with it because it dissipates when cooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001q3b6nhntxbie0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This next challenge is harder: Are most breads on grocery store shelves ultraprocessed by NOVA standards? Unless it’s freshly baked from scratch, the answer is “most likely,” although experts disagree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001r3b6njw5rlwzm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From the NOVA perspective, if a bread lasts longer than a week or so without mold, it may have a synthetic preservative in it. Common additives in bread include calcium propionate, an artificial preservative linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12173999/" target="_blank"&gt;behavior problems in children&lt;/a&gt;;  &lt;a href="https://www.foodchemadditives.com/side_effects_info/781#:~:text=General%20Side%20Effects,review%20it%20and%20respond%20soon." target="_blank"&gt;potassium sorbate&lt;/a&gt;, another synthetic preservative linked to skin and respiratory issues in people who are sensitive to it; and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), two more artificial preservatives that &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2025/04/despite-health-harm-concerns-bha-and-bht-remain-food-and-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;may be linked&lt;/a&gt; to hormone and reproductive disruption and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001s3b6nlpm4fhbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what if the bread is made with whole wheat or whole grains you can actually see and taste? It may still be ultraprocessed, but isn’t it better for you? That is still a fiercely debated question.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001t3b6n0sps4a7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, here’s a tricky one: plant-based meat substitutes. Ultraprocessed to their core, many experts say these alt meats are still better for us than red and processed meats full of saturated fats or nitrates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001u3b6ntpuo6uzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett told me &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/health/plant-based-meat-benefits-wellness"&gt;earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001v3b6naa4ks2q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants,” said Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001w3b6nnu98pqg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of the alt-meat products have dramatically improved their nutritional profiles since they first hit the market. Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by the Physicians Association for Nutrition, or PAN International, found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, dramatically higher in fiber (beef has no fiber), and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001x3b6n1vb8dx5n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also the role of plant-based meat in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promotes alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt; and coauthored the report, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001y3b6ng9goqqba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I could go on and on, but here’s the bottom line: Deciding what is “ultraprocessed and bad for your health” and “ultraprocessed, but OK to eat” is really complicated — especially for a society unwilling or unable to give up inexpensive, convenient food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmj1llnjb00373b6nv990gvau@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-lot-of-huffing-and-puffing-going-on" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A lot of huffing and puffing going on…
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde001z3b6nqktiftvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fortunately, the world is taking action. In mid-May, the World Health Organization put out a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/call-for-experts-to-develop-a-who-guideline-on-consumption-of-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;global clarion call&lt;/a&gt; for scientists to help define and create guidelines for ultraprocessed food consumption. Once the panel is chosen, the work is expected to take two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00203b6n34x02gt9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A week later, the Trump Administration released its first “Make America Healthy Again” report, calling for action on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/maha-rfk-report-medicines-processed-foods-pesticides#:~:text=The%20report%20states%20that%20children,Kennedy%20told%20reporters%20on%20Thursday"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; they say are a danger to our children’s health&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;An August 15 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/health/maha-report-draft-pesticide-ultraprocessed-food"&gt;leaked version&lt;/a&gt; of the second report — which was supposed to announce specific policy actions — instead called for the government to “continue efforts to develop a U.S. government-wide definition.” The final report, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html" target="_blank"&gt;released in September,&lt;/a&gt; provided no additional action.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00213b6nk5k303vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” University of Carolina’s Popkin &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/health/maha-report-children-health-response-wellness"&gt;told me at the time&lt;/a&gt;. “In my opinion, it shows the food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries got to the White House and won the day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00223b6nxphulf9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrew Nixon, deputy assistant secretary for media relations at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told me in an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;email the administration is confronting the UPF challenge, which is a “major driver of the nation’s chronic disease epidemic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00233b6n76o0g9we@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Replacing them with real, whole foods is one of the most effective ways to Make America Healthy Again,” Nixon said. “We remain committed to serving the American people, not special interests or outside critics, by delivering radical transparency and upholding gold-standard science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00243b6njra0ps5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other groups have stepped into the void. The American Heart Association, for example, divided ultraprocessed food into &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365" target="_blank"&gt;three categories&lt;/a&gt; — least healthy, moderately healthy and healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00253b6nkypfpr5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Understandably, the AHA is most concerned with how foods impact the heart. High-fat red and processed meats fall within the “least healthy” category in the AHA report — as they should, considering their role in heart disease and colon cancer. However, red meat is also the &lt;em&gt;least &lt;/em&gt;processed food in that category.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00263b6nbxck5sk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And yet, that’s the point: Regulating ultraprocessed foods by additives alone — without also addressing the health concerns of too much sugar, salt and saturated fat (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/beef-tallow-healthy-seed-oils-rfk-wellness"&gt;beef tallow&lt;/a&gt;!) — won’t improve the nation’s food supply and our deteriorating health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00273b6nbt273vwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an effort to fix that, Monteiro is campaigning for researchers and government officials to add more ingredients to the NOVA definition often used in creating food policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00283b6n9f4i7pxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our proposal now is to target any food with an excess of sodium, saturated fat or sugar, along with synthetic colors, flavors and non-nutritive sweeteners,” Monteiro told me when I reported on a recent &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank"&gt;three-part series&lt;/a&gt; in the journal The Lancet. He and Popkin coauthored the articles with 41 other internationally known scientists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00293b6nieju32em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, there is a missing element, according to Harvard’s Willett: “The huge blind spot of refined grains, which is the largest source of calories in the US and most countries at this time — this is not considered to be an UPF.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002a3b6non1c1zpt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Lancet series blasted the food industry, claiming global corporations continued to aggressively market and extensively profit from new and existing UPF products despite increasing evidence of harm to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002b3b6n5tey3pfn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The food industry doesn’t want to lose their cash cow, so they’re willing to put millions into fighting government restrictions on ultraprocessed food as well as funding nutritionists who’ll say there’s no evidence of harm,” Popkin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002c3b6noxi9dtdn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The International Food &amp;amp; Beverage Alliance, founded in 2008 by leading food and nonalcoholic beverage companies, told me in an email when the Lancet series published that health authorities worldwide have rejected the concept of ultraprocessed food due to its lack of scientific consensus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002d3b6nm2z8rndk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The policy and advocacy recommendations of this series go far beyond the available evidence — proposing new regulatory action based on ‘processing’ or additive ‘markers’ and calling for the exclusion of industry from policymaking,” said IFBA Secretary-General Rocco Renaldi.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002e3b6nmdm6mfmt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            California made history in early October by enacting the &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB1264/id/3248161" target="_blank"&gt;first law in the United States&lt;/a&gt; to define and ultimately ban problematic ultraprocessed foods in public schools.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002f3b6nloi6vmlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only does the California legislation define ultraprocessed food — not an easy task as you have seen — it requires public health officials and scientists to decide which UPFs are most harmful to human health. An “ultraprocessed food of concern” would then be phased out of the school food supply. That’s impressive, considering California is projected to serve &lt;a href="https://a46.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250603-california-advances-first-nation-legislation-phase-out-harmful-ultra" target="_blank"&gt;over 1 billion meals&lt;/a&gt; to schoolchildren in the 2025–26 school year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002g3b6nkpnqn2tf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/health/california-governor-bans-red-dye-no-3-wellness/index.html"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has also led the way in laws banning &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/26/health/food-dyes-maha-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1559.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;potassium bromate&lt;/a&gt;, a possible carcinogen once widely used in breads, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/10/health/food-additives-dye-brominated-vegetable-oil-wellness/index.html"&gt;brominated vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2004.83" target="_blank"&gt;propylparaben&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002h3b6nxnrl4lqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Here in California, we are actually doing the work to protect our kids’ health, and we’ve been doing it since well before anyone had ever heard of the MAHA movement,” said Jesse Gabriel, the Democratic California Assemblymember who introduced several of the bills, in an October 9 press conference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002i3b6nhobwcthy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s so promising about the legislation is the scope of the effort. California lawmakers have considered many of the ways in which both junk and ultraprocessed foods may be harmful to human health — ingredients such as nonnutritive sweeteners; additives such as emulsifiers, stabilizers and thickeners; flavor enhancers; a host of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness"&gt;food dyes&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002j3b6noq80rasu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            American scientific research on the harms of UPF additives is in its infancy, but the new law has taken that into account. Additives banned, restricted or required to carry a warning by other local, state, federal or international jurisdictions will be in the analysis. That’s key, as the European Union and other countries have already regulated many additives still allowed in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002k3b6nej52qhrp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Food modified to contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar can also be rejected, according to the law. This will help target industry strategies that may contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness"&gt;an addiction to ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; — an increasing concern for American children &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/health/ultraprocessed-food-ban-california-wellness"&gt;raised on UPFs&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002l3b6nvciqv3hs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The downside? The law won’t provide final details on which UPFs are most concerning until June 2028, and it won’t have all UPFs out of school lunches until 2035. I’m hopeful there will be useful updates as the process rolls along.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002m3b6ngkrhfqwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While we wait for definitive action (don’t hold your breath), we still have to navigate the grocery store. Of course, the best way is to buy everything fresh and cook at home. But like you, I’m far too busy to do as much of that as I would like — plus my kids are grown and the pressure to set a good example is gone (although my new grandson may change that).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002n3b6ny3yjvcio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, I stock up on frozen veggies — many are flash frozen and have the same nutrients as when first picked. Low-sodium canned beans and other legumes keep me from having to cook dry beans from scratch.

            When I buy fresh produce, I try to buy organic if my budget allows. That’s especially true for crops in the 2025 “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/2025-dirty-dozen-pesticide-wellness"&gt;Dirty Dozen&lt;/a&gt;,” an annual list of foods with the most (and least) &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/health/pesticides-produce-fruits-vegetables-toxins-wellness"&gt;pesticides&lt;/a&gt; created by the Environmental Working Group, a health advocacy group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            I also do my best to avoid veggies and salad greens packaged in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/food-packaging-chemical-toxins-study-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;chemical-laden plastics&lt;/a&gt; (that’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;whole other problem&lt;/a&gt; I write about). I especially stay away from precut veggies (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969708/#:~:text=The%20B%20vitamins%20are%20highly,in%20small%20losses%20of%20iron." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;loss of nutrients&lt;/a&gt;) and foods sold in black plastic containers (&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/health/flame-retardant-black-plastic-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;read about those here&lt;/a&gt;.) That’s really hard because they are &lt;em&gt;everywhere!&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When it comes to ready-to-heat-and-eat meals, I look for whole chicken breasts, sliced beef and pork, chicken or steak kebabs, and stews with real chunks of meat. (Here’s a tip: If the package says the meat is cooked “sous vide,” I’ve found it’s more likely to be whole meat.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As for the rest of the grocery store — the nearly 70% which is ultraprocessed — I do my best. I don’t know all the names of additives — much less which are harmful or beneficial — so that’s not very helpful to me. I could just as easily discard a food enriched with pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) or cobalamin (vitamin B12) as I could one with azodicarbonamide, a bleaching agent in bread &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:007:0045:0046:EN:PDF" target="_blank"&gt;banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt; due to cancer concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Instead, I put on my detective hat, turn the product over, and read — starting with the nutrition label. Many people go straight to carbohydrates, but carbs are not necessarily the enemy — in whole foods they come naturally, along with fiber, vitamins and minerals. Foods which are overly processed, however, may need to increase levels of added sugars, salt and fat to make the food “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31689013/" target="_blank"&gt;hyperpalatable&lt;/a&gt;” and hard to resist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002s3b6njdl1dj2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A tablespoonful of ketchup, for example, can contain 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of added sugar, while spaghetti and pizza sauces are notoriously high in added sugar as well. If you search the shelves, however, there are low-salt, no sugar and no artificial sweetener options.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002t3b6n2b9ueek0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And this is important&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— the percentages on the nutrition label are only for &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;serving. Let’s take honey peanut butter, part of a typical PB&amp;amp;J lunch for my kids while they were growing up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002u3b6nnxt2741m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The label says one serving — two tablespoons of peanut butter — has 13 grams of sugar (2.5 teaspoons). So if I put 3 servings on the sandwich — that’s an incredible &lt;em&gt;39 grams &lt;/em&gt;or&lt;em&gt; 7.3 teaspoons &lt;/em&gt;of sugar&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(not counting the jelly) in what many of us consider a healthy meal for a child.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002v3b6n42x3n26z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (OK, you may know this, yes. But truthfully, how often do you stop and look at serving size? Yeah, me neither.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002w3b6nofpy0pxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I then move to the ingredients listed in the order of prevalence. I look for signs of overprocessing (powdered veggies, of course). Additives are always at the bottom, but other culprits rise to the occasion. If sugar is first, second or third on the list, I tend to consider the food a dessert. If ingredients at the top are healthy and sugar is toward the bottom of the list, I’m not overly concerned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002x3b6n173ijfkn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s a great example: An extremely popular organic bread in grocery stores has 35 ingredients — the first 21 are whole grains and seeds. The loaf has no synthetic additives, but it does have 4 grams of added sugar per serving in the form of organic molasses. Would you consider that a junk food? An ultraprocessed food overly laden with sugar? Or is it healthy? You decide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002y3b6nwkqz3hbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet you shouldn’t have to decide, experts say. You should be able to go to your grocery store and buy foods that are good for you without having to play detective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde002z3b6nxx0hb3hn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The rise of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in human diets is being driven by the growing economic and political power of the UPF industry,” wrote&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01567-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;third Lancet paper&lt;/a&gt;. “Curbing corporate power in food systems begins with governance reform.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00303b6nlc6kevoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Otherwise, they added, UPFs may well “replace all other food groups” in the not-so-distant future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00313b6nxgooe932@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, there will always be junk food, and yes, we will all succumb at times. But if the majority of our food was regulated to be as whole, fresh, and devoid of added sugar, salt, fat, additives and processing as possible, we would be a much healthier nation — and world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj1lllde00323b6nywol4qay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I’m not holding my breath.
    &lt;/p&gt;

For these reasons and more, it should form the foundation of your weekly movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insight has given rise to the goal of walking &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; – a figure recent &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; claims has “no scientific basis”, but one that promotes 90-odd minutes on your feet each day, which will still deliver plenty of health perks for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common rebuttal to this popular prescription is a lack of time; the idea of carving out 90 minutes of walking time in a busy day can seem insurmountable to many, even when this is split into smaller chunks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those in this camp, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html"&gt;Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Sydney, suggests an alternative approach based on his recent research around walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan below is designed as a starting point for sedentary people who struggle to find time to exercise. It uses the latest science to secure optimal bang for your buck from your steps, providing a pathway to more movement and better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The time-efficient walking plan for better health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each day, complete: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One or two walks at a comfortable but steady pace, lasting 10 to 15 minutes or more. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During these walks, include two to four 30 to 60-second fast-paced bursts. These bursts could also involve climbing stairs or walking uphill to increase the intensity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2837119.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/27/10/19/According-to-experts-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-the-number-of-steps-youre-taking.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/27/10/19/According-to-experts-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-the-number-of-steps-youre-taking.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/27/10/19/According-to-experts-theres-more-to-consider-than-just-the-number-of-steps-youre-taking.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking requires no specialist equipment, but can offer many health benefits, particularly for those who currently have low activity levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-203181"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking requires no specialist equipment, but can offer many health benefits, particularly for those who currently have low activity levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind this plan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who will prosper most from exercise are not the sporting elite, but rather those who currently move very little – the transition from zero exercise to some exercise is where the greatest spike in benefits can be seen. This is the population Professor Stamatakis chooses to focus on in much of his research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our primary audience is people who are less active – often older adults or individuals who struggle to accumulate large daily step volumes,” he says. “These are the people who tend not to reach conventional targets such as 150 minutes of weekly exercise or 7,000 to 8,000 steps per day. For millions in this group, structured exercise can feel unrealistic or unappealing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues set out to find small but achievable adjustments people could make in their daily behaviours to access “meaningful health benefits”. This year, they uncovered a couple of options: aiming for longer walks rather than shorter ones, and increasing the intensity of your walks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those taking 8,000 steps a day or less, longer walks lasting 10 minutes or more were found to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by two-thirds compared to those who accrued their daily steps through shorter walks, according to a 2025 &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41144973/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Sydney and Universidad Europea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is a very empowering one: there are options other than dramatically increasing the amount of physical activity you do to improve health,” Professor Stamatakis says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that even one or two comfortable, steady 10 to 15-minute walks a day may meaningfully reduce cardiovascular risk. For many older or less active adults, this is a far more achievable goal than trying to accumulate thousands more steps or beginning structured exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying short walks don’t count; they absolutely do. But if someone’s daily movement is mostly made up of, for example, two- to three-minute bouts of light- to moderate-intensity walking, shifting even a portion of that into slightly longer stretches may produce measurable health gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A brisk, continuous walk to the shops, around the block or during a phone call can be a great start.

Combine the two and you have acts such as climbing the stairs, carrying heavy shopping or even vigorous housework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that, in non-exercisers, “between five to 10 episodes of vigorous-intensity activity, lasting up to one minute, done on a daily basis, seems to be associated with between 30 and 50 per cent lower risk of cardiovascular conditions, cancer and mortality”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A sustainable daily plan of physical activity for people who do not do many steps might include one or two longer bouts of walking at a comfortable but steady pace, each incorporating three to four short ‘VILPA’ bursts of very fast walking lasting 30 to 60 seconds each,” Professor Stamatakis says. “If the opportunity arises, these short bursts may also involve stair climbing or uphill walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using this scenario, the person could accumulate 15 to 30 minutes of walking per day in the pattern most likely to be beneficial. This includes three to eight minutes of &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-more-effective-walking-heart-health-b2878666.html"&gt;vigorous-intensity activity&lt;/a&gt;, which, we know, can work miracles for heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see long-term benefits, the caveat to this plan is consistency. This practice must be followed on three to four days per week to begin with, and built up to a daily habit over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/nutrionist-healthy-longevity-diet-b2862364.html"&gt;What foods nutrition experts really eat to stop chronic illness in old age (and always avoid)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kjtpPj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Longer walks lasting 10 minutes or more have been linked to increased positive impacts on heart health than shorter strolls" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-203183"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Longer walks lasting 10 minutes or more have been linked to increased positive impacts on heart health than shorter strolls&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The purpose of this plan &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end goal here should still be to increase your overall activity levels in line with &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; physical activity guidelines for adults aged 19-64. “Do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or do an equivalent combination of both”. Introducing formal exercise will usually be the most direct route to improved health and fitness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this plan is designed for non-exercisers who are not currently physically active – those who take less than 8,000 steps per day, by Professor Stamatakis’ definition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a professional athlete or avid exerciser added two 15-minute walks into their days, the impact on their heart health would likely be negligible as they already have a strong foundation of fitness. But for those who struggle to squeeze regular movement into their routine, it represents a significant step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of Professor Stamatakis’s research is to expand the options available to “the 80 to 85 per cent of the population, usually middle-aged and older adults, who are not keen on regular structured exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not about an optimal fitness solution,” his colleague and co-author Dr Matthew Ahmadi adds. “If you want to become fully fit, of course, structured exercise is the way to go, but it comes with major commitments. You need to have the time, motivation and skills to know how to do it; sometimes you need to spend money on gym memberships and gear, and even travel to another place because not everyone lives near a park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a long list of reasons why most people don’t exercise regularly, or at all. This is the target population that our research is addressed to, and these are the people we want to help because they are at the highest risk of chronic disease and compromised lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/negative-health-effects-of-sitting-down-b2842653.html"&gt;From back pain to heart health – Experts reveal how to counter the negative effects of too much sitting down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPeW9MX3o5TTZyUTE3MnNyM1diUzkxWFVxdG12X3dOOTlqZDVtM1FYbE1ISFo2bnZ5Rkg1a1MxX3hVakdQa2VMQUIxNC1OWGdrM2M3cnpGNUZqT190bWlQVUtkR3AzT09ZUDUzOW55RFdLdGQ2Z0VXeWxpVVpaVXVfdUREb3JWdjdUTUlydEpfQm0yMGhDLUR5NU1XZThDcG54aEtKLTNR</guid></item><item><title>喝多少酒才是真正的过量？关于酒精与健康的惊人真相-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-much-alcohol-is-really-too-much-the-surprising-truth-about-alcohol-and-your-health/articleshow/125913830.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us enjoy a drink after work or during weekends, a glass of wine with dinner, a beer with friends, or a whisky to unwind. It feels harmless, even normal. But according to health experts, the amount of alcohol that many people consider routine actually puts them into the category of a heavy drinker without realising it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about addiction, it’s about understanding how much alcohol our bodies can handle before health risks increase significantly. Experts now say the surprising truth: regularly consuming what feels like a modest amount, the equivalent of about two drinks every day, can already push someone beyond safe limits and into higher-risk territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Alcohol Consumption Linked to Increased Cancer Risk, Classified as Carcinogen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t realise they’ve crossed that line because social customs and habits make those drinks seem “normal.”middle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your 'Normal' is a medical diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an unequivocal definition for excessive consumption. Based on weekly volume, Heavy Drinking is categorized as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Women: Consuming 8 or more standard drinks per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Men: Consuming 15 or more standard drinks per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This definition directly contradicts what many adults consider a relaxed or moderate habit. Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Sarah Wakeman brought this discrepancy into sharp focus when discussing these thresholds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drinking two glasses of wine a day consistently… that would put me in the heavy drinking category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would surprise most people, right? For many people that's very normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This quote is the crux of the problem: a routine considered socially normal, a few drinks over dinner several times a week—is medically classified as high-risk consumption, subjecting the body to accelerated, chronic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Calculating your standard drink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deception thrives because we confuse a "serving" with a "standard drink." The medical world defines a standard drink as containing 14 grams of pure alcohol. This standardization exposes the hidden volume in your glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the typical Indian consumer, this means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard Liquor (Whiskey/Vodka): A 30ml peg (the standard measure) is one standard drink. If you're pouring 60ml pegs, you’re instantly consuming two standard drinks per glass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wine: That generous pour in your large wine glass (often 200ml) is not one drink, it's nearly two standard drinks and often pushes women straight to the weekly limit in a single evening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simply multiplying the number of drinks by the actual alcohol content, you will find your weekend intake often skyrockets well past the 8/15 line, making your body work overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer, liver failure, and brain damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossing the 8/15 weekly threshold accelerates the trajectory toward severe, chronic disease. The health consequences are systemic and often irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cancer Risk is Non-Zero: The global consensus is that no safe drinking level exists when it comes to cancer. Alcohol is a proven carcinogen linked to increased risk for at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colorectal, mouth, throat, and liver cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organ Failure: Chronic heavy consumption overwhelms the liver, leading to fatty liver disease, inflammation (hepatitis), and ultimately irreversible cirrhosis (scarring) and organ failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain and Mental Health: Heavy use is linked to cognitive impairment, accelerated risk of dementia, and is strongly associated with the worsening of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence clearly indicates that a change in behavioral patterns is now necessary. If your weekly alcohol consumption regularly remains at or exceeds 8 standard drinks for women and 15 for men, you are effectively accepting an alarming and avoidable increase in serious health risks. To truly prioritize your health and well-being, it is essential to acknowledge these medical guidelines and make the necessary adjustments to your social drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

But winter is also a surprisingly active time for allergy symptoms in the Beehive State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though many people associate allergies with spring, you can absolutely have allergies in the winter, and Utah's unique climate makes them especially persistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry air, months spent indoors and winter inversion all contribute to a spike in runny noses, itchy eyes and coughing, even when nothing outside appears to be blooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about winter allergies in Utah, how to tell them apart from a cold or flu and what you can do to find relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes winter allergies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter allergies in Utah come from a mix of indoor and outdoor triggers. Some are present year-round, but they become noticeable when cold weather pushes everyone inside and air quality takes a dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Indoor allergens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indoor allergens are most often the &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/yes-you-can-have-allergies-winter#:~:text=Winter%20is%20cold%20and%20virus,can%20trap%20dust%20and%20allergens." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;cause of winter allergies&lt;/a&gt;. When doors and windows stay shut for months, indoor particles circulate constantly through your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common triggers include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust mites&lt;/strong&gt;: These thrive in warm indoor environments and can irritate sinuses throughout winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pet dander&lt;/strong&gt;: Dogs and cats spend more time indoors during cold months, shedding more allergens into the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mold&lt;/strong&gt;: Bathrooms, basements and humid areas can harbor mold spores that worsen symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indoor pollution&lt;/strong&gt;: Wood-burning stoves, fireplaces and candles add irritants to the air.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Utah winters are extra dry, static and dust buildup are even more common, creating an environment where allergy symptoms can flare easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outdoor allergens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outdoor allergens don't disappear in winter. Some trees, including juniper, cedar and elm, begin releasing pollen as early as late February. Sensitive residents can feel symptoms weeks before spring officially arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track the daily pollen levels through &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/weather/pollenCount" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;KSL's pollen count page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inversion and air quality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's winter inversion also plays a significant role. When cold air becomes trapped under warm air, pollutants build up close to the ground. These pollutants aren't allergens, but they irritate the respiratory system and make allergy symptoms feel more intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor air quality can trigger:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Congestion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throat irritation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watery or itchy eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathing discomfort, especially for people with asthma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indoor air quality can deteriorate when heating systems operate continuously. There are some &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50880894/5-ways-to-improve-your-utah-homes-winter-air-quality?" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;easy steps you can take to improve your home's air&lt;/a&gt;, including replacing your air filter and testing for radon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it winter allergies, a cold or the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold and flu season arrives just as winter allergies ramp up, which makes it tricky to know what's causing your symptoms. But there are some &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/34133189/do-you-have-a-cold-hellip-or-is-it-seasonal-allergies" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;consistent differences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to tell them apart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;: Colds and the flu usually clear up within three to 10 days. Allergies tend to linger for weeks or months. If your symptoms last longer than 10 days, allergies are more likely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fever&lt;/strong&gt;: Allergies don't cause fever. The flu often does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body aches&lt;/strong&gt;: Viral illnesses commonly cause body aches; allergies don't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mucus color&lt;/strong&gt;: Allergies usually produce clear mucus. Yellow or green mucus tends to &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-nasal-mucus-color-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;indicate a viral or bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itching&lt;/strong&gt;: Itchy eyes, nose or throat are classic allergy symptoms, not cold or flu symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If symptoms include a high fever, sudden worsening, shortness of breath or anything that interferes with normal breathing, it's important to seek medical care. Allergists can pinpoint specific triggers and recommend long-term options like &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/46301789/allergy-shots-helps-utah-father-battle-spring-allergy-season" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How long do winter allergies last?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter allergies in Utah can last from late fall through early spring. Indoor heating, inversion cycles and early tree pollen mean symptoms often persist from November into March or even April. Your personal triggers and exposure levels will determine how long your symptoms stick around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and relief tips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While allergies can't be cured, there are several steps you can take to reduce symptoms and improve daily comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improve indoor air quality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since indoor allergens are one of the biggest winter triggers, start by reducing the particles circulating in your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change HVAC filters regularly. High-efficiency filters capture dust, mold and dander.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vacuum and dust often. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash bedding weekly. Hot water kills dust mites and removes buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control humidity. Keep indoor humidity between &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/humidifiers-and-indoor-allergies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;40% and 50&lt;/a&gt;%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use an air purifier. HEPA purifiers help clean bedrooms and high-traffic areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reduce exposure to specific allergens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust mites&lt;/strong&gt;: Use allergen-proof pillow and mattress covers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pet dander&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep pets out of bedrooms and groom them more often.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mold&lt;/strong&gt;: Clean damp spaces regularly and address leaks promptly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medication options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find relief from winter allergies in Utah with common over-the-counter treatments, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antihistamines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nasal corticosteroid sprays&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saline rinses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short-term decongestants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to seek professional help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms last more than a few weeks or don't improve with over-the-counter treatments, it may be time to see an allergist. Persistent congestion, recurring sinus infections, wheezing or difficulty breathing can all signal that you need additional support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An allergist can help identify your specific triggers and create a treatment plan. This could include prescription options or long-term therapies like immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

An AIIMS study has found that more than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45 — many of them apparently healthy, who collapsed without warning at home or while travelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published this month in Indian Journal of Medical Research as part of an ongoing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) project, the cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2023 and April 2024 at the departments of pathology and forensic medicine at AIIMS New Delhi. Of the 2,214 autopsies analysed, 180 cases — 8.1% — met the criteria for sudden death. Young adults aged 18–45 accounted for 103 of these cases, or 57.2%, with an average age of 33.6 years and a strong male predominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease emerged as the leading cause. Dr Sudhir Gupta, from AIIMS’s department of forensic medicine and an author of the study, said cardiovascular conditions accounted for 42.6% of sudden deaths in the young. Most had advanced coronary artery disease with severe blockages, often without any prior diagnosis, indicating that fatal heart disease had progressed silently. Respiratory causes — such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and asphyxia — accounted for a little over one in five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one-fifth of deaths in young adults remained unexplained despite detailed imaging, full autopsy and microscopic examination. These “negative autopsy” cases point to hidden electrical or genetic heart disorders that routine investigations may miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most deaths occurred at home or during travel, frequently at night or early morning. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom reported by families, followed by chest pain and breathlessness. Only a small number of young adults had known conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Over half of those who died young were smokers or consumed alcohol — rates similar to those for older adults. The study found no significant link between sudden deaths and Covid infection or vaccination — vaccination coverage was high across age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults aged 46–65, coronary artery disease was even more predominant, accounting for over 70% of sudden deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the findings, Dr K K Talwar, chairman, PSRI Heart Institute, said the study highlights a disturbing rise in premature coronary artery disease. He noted that many unexplained deaths occur likely due to inherited electrical disorders of the heart, which routine autopsies cannot detect, underscoring the need for genetic testing and family screening. He stressed early preventive check-ups, strict avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, and routine heart evaluations in younger people, while reiterating there is no evidence linking Covid vaccination to sudden cardiac deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers warn that sudden death in the young often stems from underlying disease, making early detection critical.

For men, hair loss can be genetic but can be&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; triggered by weight loss or even a fever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If hair loss is accompanied by fatigue, brain fog and weight gain, you may be suffering from an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism, which slows the metabolism down, according to Professor Kristien Boelaert, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Birmingham. A blood test can determine if the issue is thyroid-related. “Once thyroid levels come back into balance, hair loss will recover but this can take several months,” Boelaert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/beauty/article/weight-loss-jabs-hair-loss-cause-8376fbg8f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why some people on weight-loss jabs are losing their hair&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4dc1d114-de65-478a-b32b-c10c97322eae" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Greasy hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genetics and overproduction of sebum in the scalp’s sebaceous glands are the primary causes of greasy hair, which can be exacerbated by hot weather and exercise. “Washing hair daily using a mild shampoo, such as Simple, will usually control symptoms,” Stevens says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Look at food intake too. “A diet high in ultraprocessed foods — specifically saturated fats and refined carbohydrates — may increase oil production in the scalp by affecting hormonal balance and sebum regulation,” says Rhiannon Lambert, a nutritionist and author of The Unprocessed Plate. “Reducing your intake of these foods and focusing on a diet rich in vegetables, wholegrains, lean proteins and healthy fats can support both scalp and overall health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/beauty/article/sun-damaged-hair-10-products-that-really-work-56pxj7gj3" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sun-damaged hair? 10 products that really work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="01393e47-e68a-424a-9f89-8439e5707996" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Colour loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The development of white or grey hair signals diminishing melanin production, a normal part of ageing. But a rapid colour loss could indicate a vitamin B12 deficiency. A blood test can determine if the problem is vitamin-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Key sources of B12 include eggs, dairy, fish and meat — vegans may struggle. “Try a supplement of foods fortified in B12, such as plant milks or breakfast cereals,” Lambert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="11efb7b0-ecb3-43c1-b53b-4edc7b66c7b8" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Brittle hair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hairdryers and tongs can distress the hair shafts, but brittle hair can also be a sign of iron deficiency. This can change the texture of your hair and make it fragile, as iron is vital for red blood cells, specifically the haemoglobin within them, which carries oxygen to hair cells. Aim to eat iron-rich food at each meal, such as red meat, dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, eggs, tofu, nuts and dried apricots, raisins or figs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/article/the-secret-to-healthy-hair-try-a-japanese-head-spa-jm5jkmzq8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The secret to healthy hair?

See a doctor if you’re concerned. Generally, if you have sensitive skin or eczema, avoid shampoos containing sodium lauryl sulfate, which clean well and lather nicely but can disrupt the skin barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you develop a rash, a trichologist may remove any crusting and apply a steroid cream and recommend a tar-based shampoo — which slows down bacterial growth and reduces skin flaking. You might also need to change how you rinse you hair: “Sometimes people get an itchy scalp because of leaving product on,” says Dr Emma Craythorne, a consultant dermatologist based in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2e48324d-446d-4fac-bc9e-563d1b157187" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Extreme dandruff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The scalp continually sheds its top layer, but if you get crusty flakes bigger than half a centimetre seek advice: you may be overproducing candida, a type of yeast. This may be caused by stress or a poor diet, both of which can weaken the immune system, making it harder for your body to control the growth of candida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Dandruff can be managed with shampoos containing ketoconazole, zinc pyrithione, or coal tar,” Stevens says.

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to mix and match meals if there’s one you don’t like. The Mediterranean diet is a flexible way of eating that emphasizes a wide array of fruits, vegetables, legumes, healthy fats and whole grains. You can repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18314/cuisines-regions/mediterranean/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if it’s easier for your routine. Each breakfast and lunch are high-protein, fairly similar in calories and follow the principles of the Mediterranean diet. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two. Otherwise, a simple swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) recommends 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, though protein needs can vary.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, people who are pregnant, older adults and athletes typically have higher protein requirements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you have questions about your individual protein needs, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_183-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean is a plant-forward way of eating that emphasizes a high intake of healthy fats, like fish, nuts, olive oil and avocado. This eating pattern has been linked to a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cognitive decline, certain cancers and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though it’s coined after the Mediterranean region in which it was first studied, the Mediterranean diet is a flexible way of eating that’s adaptable to a wide variety of cuisines and cultures. If you’re interested in following the Mediterranean diet, aim to cook more meals at home and include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For proteins, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes fish, eggs, poultry, dairy and legumes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It typically limits red meat and particularly processed meats as well as refined grains and excess added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If you're recovering from sickness or injury, the nutrient will help your body heal. Protein is also needed to build muscle, especially if you exercise regularly. Also, high-protein breads can help you meet your protein needs if you have difficulty getting the nutrient from other sources. Fortunately, high-protein bread can be enjoyed just as you would any bread—in &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/853635/favorite-sandwich-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;, as toast, or as a side dish.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grain bread is a type of high-protein bread, according to Giana DiMaria, MS, RD, CDN, CNSC, CCMS, registered dietitian at New York Medical College. However, there are many varieties available, so be sure to choose one labeled "100 percent whole wheat flour," says DiMaria. The ingredient list should also include whole grains such as &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1527161/oats-steel-cut-rolled-quick-lowdown" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oats&lt;/a&gt;, barley, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/millets-health-benefits-cooking-info-7486377" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt;, brown rice, spelt, or &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-is-sorghum-8723400" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-plant-based-proteins-11710274" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;plant sources of protein&lt;/a&gt;, she notes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/what-are-sprouted-foods-8743276" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sprouted grain bread&lt;/a&gt;, whole grains (which are technically seeds) are allowed to sprout, or germinate. This is done by soaking the grains until they sprout, per DiMaria. "The sprouting process makes the grains easier to digest and increases the bioavailability of protein," says Landry. "Sprouted bread is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/high-fiber-foods-11725829" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good for fiber&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins, magnesium, and folate," says Connie Elick, MS, RD, and instructor of plant-based culinary arts at the Institute of Culinary Education's Los Angeles campus.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When seeds are incorporated into bread, the final protein content is higher. Examples of seeds that may be used in bread include pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-eat-flax-seeds-8681980" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flax seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/benefits-of-chia-seeds-11759791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, according to Landry. Seeds also provide healthy fats (particularly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-omega-3-foods-to-eat-11815581" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;), vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc, he notes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some breads contain nuts, which offer plant-based protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-anti-inflammatory-foods-11716890" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory fats&lt;/a&gt;. Nuts also contain insoluble fiber, which bulks the stool and regulates bowel movements, says DiMaria. It's common to find high-protein breads made with a mixture of nuts and seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "These breads are made with flours from &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8192192/health-benefits-lentils" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/garbanzo-beans-vs-chickpeas-8362708" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, or other legumes, which are protein-rich," explains Landry. Depending on the product, the legume flours may be used as the primary ingredient or blended with traditional grain flours, he says. Legume-based bread "can also be a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, and other nutrients," per Elick.&lt;br&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/genetic-mutation-sperm-donor-scli-intl"&gt;sperm donor with a rare genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt; linked to an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2025/12/06/politics/food-and-drug-administration-turmoil-leadership"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; fathered at least 197 children across Europe, some of whom have already died from the disease, according to a new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor, who is himself healthy, had a rare mutation in a gene named TP53, which is likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare disorder that increases a person’s risk of developing cancer. He was unaware when he made the sperm donations that he was affected by the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, CNN reported that the man had fathered at least 67 children in eight European countries, but a major investigation published by news outlets Wednesday has shown that the number of affected children is in fact far higher than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgmy90z991o"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of 14 European public service broadcasters involved in the investigation, the new figure is the product of freedom of information requests and interviews with doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man donated to a single private sperm bank in Denmark named the European Sperm Bank (ESB), but his sperm was later used by 67 clinics in 14 different countries. The final number of affected children may be higher still, “as data has not been obtained from all countries,” the BBC added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known how many of these children have inherited the genetic mutation, but only a small proportion of those who have done so will avoid developing some form of cancer in their lifetimes. People with the condition have a 90% chance of developing one or more kinds of cancer by age 60, and around 50% do so before age 40, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22073-li-fraumeni-syndrome"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, identified an initial 67 children during a presentation at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, she said 10 of the children had been diagnosed with cancers such as brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma, and another 13 were carrying the gene but had not yet developed a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will require regular medical examinations due to their increased risk of developing cancer, and have a 50% chance of transmitting it on to their own children, Kasper said back in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Clare Turnbull, professor of cancer genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, told CNN that “Li Fraumeni syndrome is a devastating diagnosis to impart to a family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a very high risk of cancer throughout the lifetime,” she added, “with a sizeable risk of childhood-onset cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case “represents a highly unfortunate coincidence of two exceptionally unusual events: that the donor’s sperm carry mutations for an extremely rare genetic condition affecting fewer than 1 in 10,000 people and that his sperm has been used in the conception of such an extraordinarily large number of children,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Herbert, professor of reproductive biology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said the investigation “highlights an urgent need for more comprehensive genetic screening of sperm donors and for strict cross-border controls on the number of children conceived from a single donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is staggering that a single donor was used to conceive almost 200 children across a relatively small number of European countries,” she told CNN in a statement sent via the Science Media Centre on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokeswoman for the European Sperm Bank (ESB), told CNN that the company is “deeply affected by the case and the impact that the rare TP53 mutation has on a number of families, children and the donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have our deepest sympathy,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ESB tests and performs an individual medical assessment of all donors in full compliance with recognized and scientific practice and legislation,” Budtz said, adding that the ESB supports calls for a limit on the number of children that are allowed to be born using a single donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The legislation on these areas is complex, with many and often conflicting considerations, and the implementation of the regulation differs greatly from country to country,” she added. “Hence, there is need for common and transparent European standards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The-CNN-Wire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;™ &amp;amp; © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

To make up for the lack of published information, he included conference presentations and preliminary, unpublished findings in the review paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Upon compiling available evidence, Van Ameringen and his team found “stronger signals” for the efficacy of psychedelics, specifically psilocybin (the psychoactive component of “magic mushrooms,”) than for cannabinoids like THC and CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Van Ameringen theorizes that the difference is related to how these substances interact with areas of the brain related to OCD. While cannabinoids activate the brain’s CB1 receptors, which regulate symptoms like compulsions and anxiety, available evidence shows they don’t offer lasting relief from OCD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Psilocybin, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can reduce connectivity&lt;/a&gt; in the brain’s default mode network, which “essentially is involved in self referential thinking and rumination. The default mode network is really activated in OCD”, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A difference in the methodology of cannabis and psilocybin studies might also have contributed to the different results, says Dr Mohamed Sherif, a psychiatrist and computational neuroscientist at Brown University who will lead a future clinical trial on psilocybin for OCD. Psychedelic clinical trials, like the one Sherif is planning, tend to offer patients not only medication but also encouragement to frame their experience as a therapeutic “journey”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This was not done in cannabinoids [studies,]” Sherif explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Terrence Ching, a clinical psychologist at the Yale School of Medicine, similarly wondered if the way people use cannabis versus psilocybin might explain the different outcomes. While people tend to use cannabis for temporary relief, psilocybin can help facilitate actual changes in the brain and in patients’ perception of their OCD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One could use cannabis for the same therapeutic reason, of confronting something deeper about their OCD or their obsessive fears. But conventionally, people tend to use cannabis for an avoidance function,” Ching explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Preliminary results from Ching’s clinical trial on a single dose of psilocybin for OCD were included in Van Ameringen’s review paper, and showed that psilocybin was effective for OCD symptoms compared to placebo. Ching is now preparing the results of the trial for publication, and planning a second clinical trial where OCD patients will receive two doses of psilocybin at different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the single dose trial, 11 patients each received psilocybin or niacin, a placebo intended to mimic some of psilocybin’s effects so that patients would be unsure which drug they’d received. During dosing sessions, patients would sit with two facilitators who would offer minimal guidance in the form of open ended questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ching said his protocol included strict rules about the type of touch that was allowed if patients requested it – only a hand on the shoulder or forearm – to create unambiguous ethical limits. &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-mdma-therapy-videos-1.6400256" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Past psychedelic clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; have generated controversy when facilitators initiated unwanted touch with participants who were under the influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ching said the trial was useful not only in showing that psychedelics can improve OCD symptoms, but also in revealing more about the nature of OCD, both for clinicians and for the participants themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Psilocybin is known for inducing “mystical experiences”, characterized by a specific type and intensity of psychedelic effects, according to Ching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What we see in OCD is more often partial mystical experiences, people are kind of pumping the brakes when they have a sense that the psilocybin wants to take them into a deeper state of experiencing,” Ching said, adding that this highlights one of the core features of the disorder – the need to be in control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While clinicians in psychedelic trials might typically encourage patients to go deeper, Ching said that with OCD patients, it’s important to remain “non-directive and non-judgemental”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the trial, Ching saw patients recognize their own resistance to the drug and gain deeper insight into their need for control, saying things like: “I really realize that this is how I’ve approached unknowable things in my life, but that’s what life is. Life is full of unknowable things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ching is hopeful about the future of psychedelic medications, but there are several obstacles that make researching them difficult. Psilocybin is still an illegal schedule I substance in the US, which means that researchers must take additional steps to study it, including working with a DEA liaison and using a DEA approved safe that “needs to be bolted down to the ground”, in a private windowless room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers also must deal with the issue of “functional unblinding”, or the fact that psychedelic effects can mean trial participants are able to guess whether they received psilocybin or a placebo, which could alter their perception of their own symptoms. This is especially problematic given the hype around psychedelics, Ching said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many participants will enter a trial expecting a “miracle cure” – a narrative Ching believes is actually harmful to psychedelic research: “What we need to do now is to seriously, to treat psychedelics seriously, as any other worthwhile medication, to investigate in a controlled, rigorous way, in a way that is ethical, that pays homage to traditional Indigenous users of psychedelics, because there are, there is great wisdom there too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNeFVSNkdROUtpNC1RZnVkRHZCbDRwLWdNVUxoY3ZkSERTNkxpTzBlM3hhNkRjTHNkRWJEZWNpT1d0SEYtWk00bEUtdHZEMTlkM2c5UFhuUXdJWXpGV0NpbGJPeVZGZlN6bDFTTGlJMUlFdDhtZWFWNk1NemxGZTY2Z2ZwMWpUb190UmpoX1NR</guid></item><item><title>康涅狄格州报告4年多来首例麻疹病例--《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/13/metro/connecticut-reports-first-measles-case-in-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

Electromagnetic radiation in the form of light or sound waves hit a mirror or wall, respectively, and change course. This allows our eyes to see a reflection or echo of the original input. However, for more than 50 years, &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1139931" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientists have theorized;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;scientists have theorized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that there’s another kind of reflection in quantum mechanics known as time reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This term might conjure up images of &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a20718322/building-a-time-machine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a nuclear-powered DeLorean;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a nuclear-powered DeLorean&lt;/a&gt; or a particular police box (that’s bigger on the inside), but that’s not quite what scientists mean by the term. Instead, time reflections occur when the entire medium in which an electromagnetic wave travels suddenly changes course. This causes a portion of that wave to reverse and its frequency transforms into another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because these time reflections require a uniform variation across an entire electromagnetic field, scientists assumed it would require too much energy to actually observe time reflections in action. But scientists from the Advanced Science Research Center at the CUNY Graduate Center (CUNY ASRC) in New York City &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/982119" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:successfully observed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;successfully observed&lt;/a&gt; time reflections by sending broadband signals into a strip of metal filled with electronic switches that were connected to reservoir capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This allowed the researchers to trigger the switches at will, doubling impedance along the strip. This sudden change caused the signals to carry a successful time-reversed copy. The results were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41567-023-01975-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fa69717180%2Ftime-reflections-are-real-scientists-confirm%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Physics;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is very difficult to change the properties of a medium quick enough, uniformly, and with enough contrast to time reflect electromagnetic signals because they oscillate very fast,” Gengyu Xu, a coauthor and post-doc student at CUNY ASRC, said in a press statement. “Our idea was to avoid changing the properties of the host material, and instead create a metamaterial in which additional elements can be abruptly added or subtracted through fast switches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This time reflection also behaves differently than spatial reflections. Because this time echo reflects that last part of the signal first, the researchers say that if you looked in a &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; mirror, you would see your back instead of your face. To translate the experience acoustically, it’d be like listening to a tape on rewind—which is to say fast and high-pitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The shift in frequency, if it could be perceived by our eyes, would look like colors of light suddenly changing to another color, such as red switching to green. This strange counter-intuitive nature of time reflection is part of what has made studying the concept so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This has been really exciting to see, because of how long ago this counterintuitive phenomenon was predicted, and how different time-reflected waves behave compared to space-reflected ones,” corresponding author Andrea Alù, a physics professor and director of CUNY ASRC’s Photonics Initiative, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The big question: &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;hy&lt;/em&gt; have scientists worked toward recreating this theoretical time reflection in a laboratory? Well, more minute control of electromagnetic waves can vastly improve wireless communications and even lead to advancements in low-energy, wave-based computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In other words, it simply helps to know everything there is about electromagnetic waves—both forward and backward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 15:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVnBWZ3dKY3o4OVJDdzdjNFpRWFNnQmJpQjlwUGpTdmszZ095WDFqWnVkb0pXWTRIS3JqQ1hwRGlMTDFwX181ZzBwd1JfU2VhLWxHb1ZZODYwdW1IaFg0MTlTZkRmcEVLQ0czQUJlX1dvVGk5RjF2enNfRERadGNRYWZuVWVNOTNGcjFsWGNWeU5ueVZVczVmTUc5dw</guid></item><item><title>研究人员揭示了自闭症患者及其兄弟姐妹的独特叙事模式- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/researchers-uncover-a-distinct-narrative-pattern-in-autistic-people-and-their-siblings/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of individuals with autism and their siblings and parents found that autistic individuals and their siblings used fewer causal explanations to connect story elements when asked to tell a story based on a series of pictures. They also used fewer descriptions of the thoughts and feelings of protagonists. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-024-06424-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior or interests. People on the autism spectrum tend to perceive and organize information in distinctive ways that can be strengths in some contexts and challenges in others. Among other things, they seem to differ from their neurotypical peers in the way they tell stories—specifically regarding their narrative patterns and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that many autistic individuals produce narratives that are shorter or less elaborated compared to neurotypical peers, focusing more on concrete details than on social or emotional aspects. Difficulties may appear in organizing stories into a clear beginning, middle, and end, or in emphasizing the motives, thoughts, and feelings of characters. At the same time, many autistic people display strong memory for facts and may provide narratives rich in precise and specific information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Kritika Nayar and her colleagues wanted to explore and compare the narrative skills of individuals with autism and their first-degree relatives. They wanted to see whether their narrative skills and styles showed similarities with their relatives who do not have autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 56 autistic individuals, 42 of their siblings who do not have autism, 49 control participants without autism (who were not related to the autistic participants), 161 parents of autistic individuals, and 61 parents who do not have autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there were 58 parent-child pairs in the autism group, and 20 parent-child pairs in the control group. The average age of participants with autism and their siblings and peers was approximately 17–19 years. The average age of parents of participants with autism was roughly 50 years, and the average age of parents of non-autistic participants was roughly 46 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were given a 24-page wordless picture book called “Frog, Where Are You?” depicting the adventures of a boy and his dog while searching for a missing pet frog. The story is comprised of five main search episodes in addition to the introduction, plot establishment, and resolution. Participants were asked to narrate the story page-by-page while viewing it on a device that tracked their eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All audio files of their narration were transcribed and then hand-coded by researchers. Study authors looked for descriptions of affective states and behaviors of protagonists, and protagonists’ cognitive states and behaviors. They also looked for causal explanations of story protagonists’ behaviors and for causal explanations of protagonists’ feelings and cognitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors differentiated between explicit causal language, marked by the use of the term “because,” and more subtle use of causal language indicated by words such as “so,” “since,” “as a result,” “in order to,” and “therefore.” They also looked for the presence of excessive detail and for topic perseveration (whether a participant got stuck on a specific topic) throughout the story. Study authors analyzed participants’ eye movements while telling the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that participants with autism and their siblings used fewer descriptions of affect and cognition, and fewer causal explanations than control participants. They were also more likely to omit story components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parent groups did not differ in their overall use of causal language or in how often they described feelings and thoughts (cognition) of story protagonists. However, parents of participants with autism used more causal explanations of story protagonists’ thoughts and feelings (affect), but fewer causal descriptions of characters’ behavior compared to control parents. Results also showed some differences in gaze patterns between participants with autism and their siblings on one side, and control participants on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Findings implicate causal language as a critical narrative skill that is impacted in ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and may be reflective of ASD genetic influence in relatives. Gaze patterns during narration suggest similar attentional mechanisms associated with narrative among ASD families,” study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the cognitive characteristics of individuals with autism. However, authors note that the eye-tracking metrics used, which focused on the entirety of the book, might have masked certain important patterns of gaze that could unfold over the course of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-024-06424-0"&gt;Narrative Ability in Autism and First-Degree Relatives,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Kritika Nayar, Emily Landau, Gary E.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Don’t tell &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/bryan-johnson-removing-all-blood"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, the tech CEO famously obsessed with not dying, but the key to living longer for men just might be getting your nuts surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That’s the surprising finding in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09836-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, in which an international group of scientists studying reproduction and longevity performed an analysis on more than 100 mammals across the world, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In course of their research, the scientists found that when both females and males have their reproduction curtailed — via contraception or castration, respectively — they tend to live longer than their unaltered peers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;These findings, while eye-opening, match what we see in the everyday world. American women who reach menopause after the age of 50 &lt;a href="https://www.mariongluckclinic.com/blog/menopause-life-expectancy-research.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;have an increased chance of reaching their 90th birthday&lt;/a&gt; and tend to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/well/longevity-women-versus-men.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;outlive men&lt;/a&gt; on average by five years. Castrated men throughout history have been known to also enjoy longer lifespans, which was backed up by a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/korean-eunuchs-outlived-uncastrated-peers" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; that found eunuchs in the employ of the Korean royal family between the 16th and 19the centuries outlived uncut men by a staggering 14 to 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Pregnancy exacts a physical and emotional cost on female bodies, so it makes perfect sense that blocking conception would boost female lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“In females, lifespan increases after several different forms of sterilization, suggesting that benefits arise from reducing the substantial energetic and physiological costs of pregnancy, lactation and caring for offspring, rather than from a single hormonal mechanism,” said lead author Mike Garratt, biomedical science professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand — in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1109009" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement about the research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Males who have been sterilized before the onset of puberty, on the other hand, seem to live longer because the presence of sex hormones impacts biological aging. Case in point, the researchers found, vasectomies don’t impact male lifespans to the same extent as castration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“In males, only castration extends lifespan — not vasectomy — which indicates that the effect comes from removing sex hormones,” Garratt said. “These hormones may interact with pathways that regulate the biology of ageing, particularly during early-life development, since early-life castration has the strongest effects on lifespan. Health in later life is also increased by castration in laboratory rodents.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;For the sweeping study, the team looked at and analyzed 117 different mammals in zoos and aquariums across the world, and also analyzed several previous studies on sterilization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;From their analysis, they found that life expectancy jumped up by 10 to 20 percent after the procedures, though results depend on when sterilization happened during the lifetime of the organism. Males who get castrated before maturing live longer on average, while the timing of female sterilization doesn’t seem to impact lifespan results — though removing ovaries does tend to make women frailer and less healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Reported increases in survival in castrated men resemble the effects in other species, whereas survival of women is slightly decreased after permanent surgical sterilization,” the paper reads. “Thus the hormonal drive to reproduce constrains adult survival across vertebrates, regardless of the environment in which an animal resides.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It just goes to show that everything has a trade off, including reproduction and living longer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But we’re pretty sure that none of these life maxxing gurus on the Internet, like Bryan Johnson, will be willing to get gelded just to live several more years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and get a good whiff of your own farts — scientists say it could help guard against Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine have found that hydrogen sulfide — the rotten egg-smelling chemical compound expelled when one breaks wind — &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2021/01/rotten-egg-gas-could-guard-against-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;could protect aging brain cells from cognitive decline &lt;/a&gt;and Alzheimer’s, which is diagnosed in roughly 500,000 new patients each year in the US.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our new data firmly link aging, neurodegeneration and cell signaling using hydrogen sulfide and other gaseous molecules within the cell,” said &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/bindu-diana-paul/2777211__;!!F0Stn7g!EW0-pLP6Ur5pHnKr77vaWLx85kjEufJbwe1qBRRr9Sv8-96137UNiZwWoPTWUYlZEChp61ks_Zp-jvlb9KW4BHxIaig$" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Bindu Paul,&lt;/a&gt; associate professor at the prestigious medical center and co-author of the study, which was published in &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.pnas.org/__;!!F0Stn7g!EW0-pLP6Ur5pHnKr77vaWLx85kjEufJbwe1qBRRr9Sv8-96137UNiZwWoPTWUYlZEChp61ks_Zp-jvlb9KW4EeSFGZQ$" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the trailblazing investigation, researchers used genetically modified mice that mimic human &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/28/health/alzheimers-risk-declines-sharply-with-one-daily-lifestyle-change-researchers-say/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They injected the mice with a hydrogen sulfide-carrying compound called NaGYY, which slowly releases the gas molecules throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, the scientists tested the mice for changes in memory and motor function, and the results were shocking.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The tests revealed both cognitive and motor function improved by a staggering 50% compared to untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rodents who received the hydrogen sulfide treatment were more physically active and displayed better memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that the behavioral outcomes of Alzheimer’s disease could be reversed by introducing hydrogen sulfide,” the research team revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human body naturally creates small amounts of hydrogen sulfide to help regulate functions throughout the body. An enzyme called glycogen synthase beta helps regulate the cellular processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/04/health/yes-womens-farts-smell-worse-than-mens-heres-why/"&gt;female flatulence&lt;/a&gt; actually has a “significantly higher concentration” of hydrogen sulfide than farts from men — meaning women’s gas tends to have “greater odor intensity” than men’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, hydrogen sulfide levels decrease with age.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;When the enzyme is absent, it starts to stick too closely to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3090074/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another protein called Tau, according to another study&lt;/a&gt;. When they bind too often, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/19/health/alzheimers-scientists-find-key-to-halting-brain-decline-before-symptoms/"&gt;Tau forms clumps in neurons&lt;/a&gt; that block communication between nerve cells and eventually cause them to die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This leads to the deterioration and eventual loss of cognition, memory and motor function,” the research team explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, whiffing up the funk of your own flatulence is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking results have opened new doors to the development of drugs that will combat — and maybe even eventually defeat — the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/04/health/breakthrough-blood-test-can-find-dementia-risk-before-symptoms-start/"&gt;nightmare of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Now on the fourth day, my fever, which hovered around 100.6 the whole time, has come down to 99.6. My body aches, and the coughing has made my rib cage sore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PSXPET7EZRCGLLMMNL62SXS4KE"&gt;I tested for COVID-19 and the results were negative. Yes, I’ve had every vaccination.

You might be suffering from influenza. Colds do not usually cause body aches. This year, the dominant influenza virus has undergone a genetic drift. The new variant is called Subclade K and flu vaccines for this year may not fully protect against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K7I22ZNMFVHVDJPVXRAKATVQKQ"&gt;It is too late to take an antiviral influenza medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir (Xofluza). These prescription drugs work best when taken within 24 to 48 hours of the first symptoms. We encourage readers to invest in a rapid flu test, now available over the counter. That way, you can test at home, just as you did for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AW27S6DSHFCL3LRTWJSJCAN7NU"&gt;Q.

It has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband, Francisco — known as Pako — has always been professional, kind, and considerate to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the fall of 2020, I began to notice changes in his behavior, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/skipping-dinner-linked-to-weight-gain-obesity-study-osaka-2021-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;skipping meals&lt;/a&gt;, struggling to find the right words in conversation, and difficulties managing his finances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called him the human calculator because he had been in charge of our income and outgoings from before we got married in 2010, but all of a sudden, he would buy strange things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6455dd4e-5174-4375-b489-b719c9cec6d2" data-toc-id="6455dd4e-5174-4375-b489-b719c9cec6d2"&gt;Amazon trucks drove up to our house 3 or 4 times a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're not into hockey, but he'd go on the internet and buy tons of hockey merchandise that we'd never wear. "It's on sale," he told me. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-will-use-hundreds-of-trucks-that-use-natural-gas-2021-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Amazon trucks &lt;/a&gt;drove up to our house three or four times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;p&gt;He also ordered expensive artwork online. It was costing a fortune, and we were running out of walls to hang it on.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pako worked as a lawyer for the federal government, but despite being one of the strongest candidates on paper for promotion, he'd fall short during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I attributed it to the stress of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-stress-is-doing-to-your-brain-2020-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. We thought it was depression, and I got him the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/psychologist-vs-psychiatrist" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;best psychiatrist and a therapist&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the psychiatrist changed his medication around 15 times, nothing worked, and he was getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="686cc46e-2710-4447-9220-216a6254cb2a" data-toc-id="686cc46e-2710-4447-9220-216a6254cb2a"&gt;The communication in our marriage changed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he were making an appointment over the phone, the other person would likely become impatient because he had difficulty explaining what he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once, he was due to meet me at a doctor's office, where we often went. It should have been a 10-minute drive, but he got terribly lost. He stopped the car to describe his surroundings, and I was able to guide him there.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I'd been his princess for 17 years, but he changed the way he communicated with me. He'd snap at me. We had never fought before. "This shouldn't happen &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/signs-of-strong-marriage-couples-therapist-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;in a marriage&lt;/a&gt;," I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Then, during the last week of December 2021, he went to an eye appointment. The doctor called and said, "You need to come in." He'd detected an abnormality and thought Pako might have a brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/full-body-mri-save-your-life-or-waste-of-money-2025-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;took him for an MRI &lt;/a&gt;and, to our relief, it wasn't a tumor. However, there was bad news. The scan showed that his brain was atrophied and looked like that of an 80-year-old man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="eac4a2bd-fe37-4dc6-8fc1-be5bafe83e66" data-toc-id="eac4a2bd-fe37-4dc6-8fc1-be5bafe83e66"&gt;I was in denial when we were first told&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said we needed to see a neurologist as soon as possible. She studied the scans and the reports from Pako's psychiatrist and therapist. Then she asked if his judgment had changed. I explained the issues from the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She diagnosed him with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/son-and-i-moved-into-moms-house-after-got-sick-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; on January 28, 2022. I was a hot mess; in denial. l said, "How can that be? He's only 46." She explained that it was an early onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pako's face was frozen, then he said, "I knew it." His father died from Alzheimer's in 2012 at the age of 70. He'd watched his decline.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was confirmed at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore after Pako underwent tests, including a lumbar puncture. His condition was genetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We informed only his eldest brother, a cardiologist, and my parents. We needed a year of mostly silence to grieve in our own way. I must have cried every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, we were encouraged by breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer's in its early stages. Pako, now 50, has been on a medication named Lequembi since the spring of 2023. He has also participated in a clinical trial of a drug called Etalanetug for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3b3fbf6c-f878-41b1-b2e9-b29e7007dec2" data-toc-id="3b3fbf6c-f878-41b1-b2e9-b29e7007dec2"&gt;I care for my husband as much as possible, but I work full-time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn't even a conversation before Mom and Dad, who retired in their 60s, moved into our house in Orlando. They relocated from their home in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/family-moved-from-us-nyc-to-puerto-rico-surprising-things-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; soon after the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 74-year-old father, Roberto, walks 30,000 steps a day. He says that he wants to stay fit to support Pako and me. It's mostly due to my parents that I can work full-time, while also caring for my husband whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He can feed and bathe himself, even though he is progressing. He requires supervision, especially when he is outside the house, where there are no cameras to monitor him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents are very respectful of boundaries and refrain from intervening in his affairs. But they make sure he is eating or taking his medication when I'm not there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We felt it was time to share the news with the rest of our family in February 2023. They became our village. Pako's siblings visit often to spend time with him and take care of appointments I'm unable to attend. His 85-year-old mom calls every day from Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d5737d02-a7df-4442-853f-8f4fea32b9ec" data-toc-id="d5737d02-a7df-4442-853f-8f4fea32b9ec"&gt;I advocate for awareness of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the family have even joined us on our &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/places-everyone-should-see-once-from-frequent-traveler" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;"bucket list" &lt;/a&gt;tours to ensure we make the most of every moment together. We've visited places such as Athens, Greece, and Venice, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pako's diagnosis has upended our lives, but it has also been empowering. I advocate for carers like us, people with Alzheimer's, and raise awareness about early detection via &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://mybrainguide.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Us Against Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I'm grateful for the support of our relatives who have made sacrifices for Pako and me.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33ilpe003y26qm1aeqe1xr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest data on respiratory illness in the United States shows that shoppers and merry-makers are spreading more than just holiday cheer: They’re also passing around germs. In many cases, it’s a new virus variant that’s been causing early and busy flu seasons in Asia, Australia and Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhv800022e6fausk9ref@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US is on the cusp of finding out what this flu variant, called subclade K, will do. For the week ending December 6 — the first full week after the Thanksgiving holiday — the proportion of doctor’s visits for symptoms including fever plus a cough or sore throat rose to 3.2%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj38e0qq001j3b6s15q1af21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s above a national baseline that infectious disease experts call the epidemic threshold. It’s a signal that flu season is officially underway, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, who directs the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00032e6fmhaek46s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are two ways to gauge the start of flu season, said Rivers, who has been closely tracking cases. By the calendar, it’s week 40, around the first week in October – but that date doesn’t necessarily mean flu is spreading widely.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00042e6fg89zbl67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Going by flu activity, “the 3.1% threshold marks the onset of flu season,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00052e6fyrp7f51o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest CDC update&lt;/a&gt;, at least 14 public health jurisdictions are showing moderate to high flu activity, mostly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;concentrated in the Northeast. These include New York City, where activity is very high; New York and New Jersey, where it’s high; and Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which are in the moderate category. Flu activity is also high in Louisiana and Colorado. Other states and territories showing upticks are Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico and Idaho.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388e1e000y3b6s1d9rbzk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week also saw the season’s first reported death of a child from the flu in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37hcy600023b6sakn8c8ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that from our surveillance, influenza activity is increasing in the US right now, and therefore that the time to get vaccinated for this season is right now,” said Dr. Tim Uyeki, chief medical officer of the CDC’s influenza division, said on a call with doctors this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00062e6fda4bpzph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are signs that this season could be a bad one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00072e6flys3qmmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In New York state, flu cases began rising about two weeks earlier than usual, said Dr. James McDonald, commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, which keeps its own flu data,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;separate from the CDC’s. Flu hospitalizations have doubled each week for the past two weeks, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00082e6fz7fp1oi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s here, and it announced itself quite loudly,” McDonald said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00092e6fmxx2no71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plotted on a graph, McDonald says, &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/respiratory_viruses/activity/2025-2026/docs/current_respiratory_report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the curve is J-shaped&lt;/a&gt;, indicating a rapid rise in severe cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj39pi1000013b6sgs49gmj9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not common where you see a curve that goes like that,” he added. “What that means is, you’re seeing more people end up in a hospital quicker compared to last year. And we’re seeing more people get diagnosed with flu than last year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000b2e6f52m8yzy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The state Department of Health sent an alert to hospitals on Monday, flagging the quick rise in cases and urging them to subtype specimens and take proper infection control measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37qify00083b6s7c8mbmu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The majority of flu viruses collected and analyzed by American laboratories during this respiratory virus season have been subclade K, a variant of a flu strain called H3N2, which itself is a variety of influenza A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000d2e6f17bcz8ad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seasons during which influenza A(H3) causes the majority of influenza infections are typically characterized by more severe illness, particularly among older adults, resulting in more persons seeking care,” the &lt;strong&gt;﻿&lt;/strong&gt;New York alert said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj382uyw000u3b6s7ucbuei2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other countries including Japan, China, the UK and Canada have also reported busy flu seasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00103b6smgb2qugf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Australia, where subclade K was first detected, there were nearly half a million confirmed flu cases, smashing the record set just the year before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00113b6se50pbisn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists often look to Australia, where flu season hits between April and October — winter in the Southern Hemisphere — for clues as to what could be coming to countries in the Northern Hemisphere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00123b6skev7sr74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, there’s an old joke public health veterans tell about the unpredictability of flu season: “If you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season.” Some experts caution that the US may not see the kind of activity as in other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00133b6s3rql0ckb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had a really bad flu season last year, and whether that means we will have a bad flu season this year, it’s hard to say,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00143b6s9h5mdhui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not typical that you have two back-to-back bad flu seasons,” Nuzzo said. “I have wondered if perhaps we might be somewhat more protected than some of these other countries because of what happened in the US last year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00153b6s81h7qbyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But with a new variant in the mix, the old patterns may not hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00163b6s0w0xzayt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s going to be a pretty bad flu season,” said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. Canada too has seen an early and brisk start to its flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj388hkb00173b6sw7tp14m5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was supposed to actually be on a call right now, but the person who was supposed to be on the call with got the flu. School is closed, and their whole family has it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37sddk000c3b6s2hx130oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new variant wasn’t included in this year’s flu shots because it was identified after scientists had chosen the four strains to include this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000f2e6fj3k0tz0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu shots contain related strains, though, and they seem to be working pretty well against this variant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj39tppq00073b6slog3bu97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;recent look&lt;/a&gt; at the efficacy of flu vaccines in the United Kingdom by scientists with the UK’s Health Security Agency found that even though antibodies generated by this year’s shots didn’t neutralize subclade K viruses as effectively as other strains, the vaccines still cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization for the H3N2 strains, which were dominated by subclade K, by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness was lower for adults, including those over 65. This years vaccines cut the odds of needing to go to the ER or hospital for the flu by about 30% to 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000g2e6f2xmoixgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although that’s hopeful, it doesn’t mean the US will see the same results. Because of differences in how the vaccines are made, protection may not be as strong.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000h2e6fzhzxubs3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope that what the UK is seeing in the early season data is what we can expect, but they mostly use cell-based vaccine, and we mostly use egg-based vaccine. A little worried that we’re not going to see that level of performance,” Rivers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000l2e6fc1ftlcad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even with the flu shots’ limitations, any protection is better than no protection, said Dr. Alex Greninger, who is head of infectious disease diagnostics in the University of Washington’s Department of Laboratory Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000m2e6f5mvvpkin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It takes about seven days for vaccines to take full effect in the body. With flu season well underway, Greninger said, it’s best not to wait if you haven’t gotten this year’s vaccine yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000n2e6fqqfomleq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you get vaccinated today, that thing will be home by Christmas in terms of your immune system,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000o2e6f1a6e7pj4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The protection from flu shots is especially important for kids, who’ve had less exposure to influenza than adults and therefore have less natural immunity against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000p2e6f4rt0mn8o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a bigger deal to have gotten your vaccine than to have not gotten your vaccine when you’re a kid,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000q2e6f9zlo8xk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination data&lt;/a&gt; collected by the CDC shows that just 38% of kids have gotten a flu shot this year, lower than at the same point for the previous six seasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva000r2e6f8m99y0d1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US &lt;a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/news/us-influenza-vaccination-gaps-linked-to-record-pediatric-deaths-from-2024-to-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;set a record&lt;/a&gt; in child deaths from the flu last season. At least 280 kids died of influenza last fall and winter, the most deaths in a non-pandemic year since data was first collected in 2004. In cases where vaccination status was known, nearly 9 in 10 were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00112e6ffwbbljlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu shots don’t keep people from getting infected. But getting vaccinated is the best way to cut the odds that you’ll need to see a doctor or be hospitalized if you do get the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00122e6fzbkmqr3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They also don’t completely prevent transmission — passing the flu virus to someone else if you are sick — but they do reduce the chances of that happening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00132e6futt38dq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because flu shots aren’t perfect, it’s a good idea to take more than one precaution to avoid getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00142e6f5he0jddu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rivers, from Johns Hopkins, says she gets a flu shot every year and then watches the data. When infections start to go up, “by the holidays, for sure, I am wearing a mask in crowded places, like the airport,” she said. She also tries to avoid high-risk settings “like those indoor trampoline places my kids love.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00152e6foq5whown@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re in a place where you can’t mask, such as eating dinner around a holiday table, opening a window and bringing in fresh air or using an air purifier can help keep people from getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj33jhva00162e6fk0tmwkjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, there’s a cost. You know, we’re all thinking about our heating bill these days, but it’s an intervention that I think is always useful. It’s particularly useful when it’s not practical or it’s not desirable to wear a mask,” Rivers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj37vd4z000j3b6se1suwks5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu hits hard. Symptoms including a high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and chills tend to appear all at once rather than gradually.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmj3817ub000m3b6sfcra0oxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you get sick, it’s a good idea to get tested since there are antiviral medications that can reduce the length and severity of illness if you start them within the first 48 hours of the illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kevin Murray knows the importance of cardiac health firsthand. The Tampa dad nearly died from an undiagnosed heart condition and needed to undergo emergency bypass surgery in 2003. Murray, now 72, survived the experience, and he said it shaped the rest of his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, Murray went for a cardiology check-up. In 2021, he changed doctors. His new cardiologist gave him an advanced scan called a cardiac CT. The test produces a 3-D image of the heart and arteries, allowing doctors and patients to see any problems clearly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray's test came back clear, as he'd expected. But he said it made him start thinking about his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His parents and grandfather had all been diagnosed with heart disease. His brother Patrick, then 67, had recently begun experiencing fatigue and breathing problems. After several conversations, Murray convinced his younger to get the scan in late 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick's scan showed "significant blockages" in his arteries, Murray said. He was at high risk for a dangerous cardiac event and needed an immediate open-heart surgery. The operation resolved Patrick's symptoms and encouraged Murray's three other brothers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;to get the same test. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each member of the Murray family was found to have advanced heart disease. They all needed surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My brothers and I are very grateful that we could avoid a real catastrophe, which is what we were on the brink of," Murray told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;A "look inside the heart" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family history of heart disease is the largest warning sign for a cardiac event, said Dr. Mark Russo, professor and chief of cardiac surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. Anyone with multiple instances of heart disease in their family tree should talk to their doctor about how to best monitor their cardiac health, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Murrays all saw the same cardiologist, Dr. Alberto Morales. He told CBS News he has used Arineta's SpotLight cardiovascular CT scanner on about 10,000 patients, including the Murrays. The device can image the entire heart and cardiac system in seconds, Morales said. It is noninvasive and uses less radiation than a full-body CT scanner, according to Morales. Russo compared the test to a mammogram for the heart. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It actually allows you to look inside the heart and see disease developing. We use blood pressure and cholesterol as markers, but those are risk factors. So you can have high blood pressure, you can have high cholesterol, but that doesn't necessarily define the presence or absence of disease," Russo said. "With the cardiac CT and using a calcium score, you can actually look and see the disease developing in the heart, and allows you to detect it at a much earlier stage than most other tests." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales said that about 80% of the patients he sees have no symptoms but are diagnosed with heart disease after receiving the cardiac CT scan. Patients can have blockages that occlude 80 or 90% of their artery without having symptoms, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When heart disease is identified, Morales helps patients incorporate medication, lifestyle changes and other treatment options into their lives. The goal is to avert a major cardiac event like a heart attack. In some cases, the progression of heart disease can be slowed or even reversed. In other cases, patients may receive preventative procedures like cardiac catheterizations to clear blocked arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;"You can't fight genetics" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Murrays, receiving cardiac CTs was life-changing and potentially life-saving. Like their older brothers, Larry and Michael each had open-heart surgery. Tim was on the edge of a widowmaker heart attack, despite years of healthy living. He needed three stents, Murray said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each brother came through their operation successfully. The siblings now see Morales regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray recommends cardiac CTs to anybody he talks to "if they even mention cardiovascular health." He's also made sure his son and nephews know about their risk of heart disease. Russo said that anyone wondering about their family health history should take advantage of holiday gatherings to check in with relatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't fight genetics," Murray said. "You can change your diet, you can maintain your exercise regimen, but the genetics are a problem. I was very grateful that the technology existed so they could determine that my brothers did indeed have problems. Now, they're doing fantastically well." &lt;/p&gt;
