Ninety-nine patients needed to be hospitalized as a result of the outbreak, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" target="_blank"&gt;two young girls died.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8a5a4" class="body-graf"&gt;In Minnesota, as of Thursday afternoon one child had been hospitalized at Children’s Minnesota, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-933be7" class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the Minnesota cases are among families who traveled within the U.S., according to the state’s health department. None of the children had received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. It was unclear, however, whether the patients were old enough to qualify for the shots, usually given in two doses starting around age 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eea878" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, too, is dealing with a large, growing outbreak that has spread across the area bordering southwestern Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5e75d" class="body-graf"&gt;Fifty-nine cases have been confirmed in Arizona, with one hospitalization. Most cases are in Mohave County, located in the state’s far northwestern corner, bordering Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ea21a" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can safely say that we are actually a part of Northern Arizona’s outbreak,” said David Heaton, public information officer for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. “There’s one town that straddles the state line, and all of our cases appear to be linked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ba737" class="body-graf"&gt;Forty-four measles cases have been identified in &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, largely among unvaccinated young people. Five needed to be admitted to the hospital but have since recovered, Heaton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e4aca" class="body-graf"&gt;If outbreaks continue around the country until the end of January, the United States will lose its status of having had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated measles&lt;/a&gt; 25 years ago. This week, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 1,544 confirmed measles&lt;/a&gt; cases. Of those, just 21 cases were diagnosed in people visiting the U.S. from other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4b287" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/government-shutdown-trump-federal-jobs-furloughed-live-updates-rcna234263" target="_blank"&gt;government shutdown&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t affected the CDC’s monitoring of the ongoing measles spread, according to a person in leadership who was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9d07df" class="body-heading"&gt;Falling vaccination rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-024e95" class="body-graf"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt; found notable declines in childhood vaccination rates in more than three-quarters of counties and jurisdictions since 2019.

And simple home-cooked food. I cannot emphasise this enough.

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to live a long and healthy life wants a magic formula for reaching a ripe old age. Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy ― but there are some things you can do to bolster your odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;″If you want to live longer, improve what you’re eating and start moving your body more,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/health-and-wellness/recipes/contributors/dr-linda-shiue" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7949949" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Linda Shiue&lt;/a&gt;, an internist and director of culinary and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But knowing exactly which foods to eat for a longer life can be tricky. Shiue says that while no one needs to be perfect, it’s important to fill up on “foods in their natural state, like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and nuts.” By doing so, she said, we replace the “ultra-processed foods” in our diets, “such as shelf-stable foods that have refined carbs and high sugars, like white bread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even when we know which foods are good for us, it can be hard to figure out the right balance of healthy options that give us a better chance of living longer ― and hard to find sweets that are good for us when the craving strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked three top longevity experts what’s in their grocery carts. Here’s what they told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruciferous Vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rv3y9jnryo" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;"razor-sharp" sore throat&lt;/a&gt;. Diarrhoea is also common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The recommendation is to stay home and rest and recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, if you have underlying conditions, experience breathlessness or find symptoms don't ease after three weeks, then you shouldn't hesitate to seek medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Can I help make myself better? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 geRyoc"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a33/live/746a4c60-9b14-11f0-9701-4da89755b770.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images An array of tablets of varying colours" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Our bodies naturally fight viruses and infection, but we can also give it a helping hand with the right medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;&lt;b id="paracetamol:" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Paracetamol: &lt;/b&gt;Provided you're okay to take it, this or ibuprofen is the first port of call.

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia"&gt;Chronic Insomnia May Spark Changes in The Brain That Trigger Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176092" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803220/full"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; showing improvements in memory and thinking skills after treating nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that treating nightmares might help to slow cognitive decline and to prevent dementia from developing in some people. This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA-Approved Sleeping Pill Slows Alzheimer's Tangles in Pre-Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;President &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-autism-tylenol-medical-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Trump's suggestion last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that combination childhood vaccines, including the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, shot, should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was shocked," said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "Those vaccines don't even exist in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moss said he hadn't heard such a recommendation "since the Andrew Wakefield days," referring to the former doctor whose 1988 autism study was later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3136032/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;retracted as fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigations revealed Wakefield had undisclosed financial interests in both lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and a single-measles vaccine patent. His license to practice medicine was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump's remarks also drew in Wakefield himself. In a video posted on social media, he said the president was "adopting the very recommendation that I made back in 1998," when he first called for splitting the MMR vaccine into individual components.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a return to a discredited strategy," Moss said. "Wakefield had a financial stake in undermining MMR, and the science has never supported his claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks of splitting the MMR vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes of splitting a combination vaccine are not abstract, Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical historian, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The immunization schedules are very carefully worked out so the vaccines have the most immunogenicity at the right age," he explained. "If you start splitting things up, you create barriers. Parents don't always come back, or they pick and choose, and coverage goes down. It's as simple as that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, argued that the call to split vaccines is part of a broader campaign to discredit vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every couple of weeks, there's a new zinger: first &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-thimerosal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-schedule/science-behind-vaccine-schedule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;spacing&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, now splitting MMR," he said. "Eventually, this topples the whole vaccine infrastructure like a house of cards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical risks of dismantling the MMR schedule are clear. Measles remains one of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;most contagious viruses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in circulation, capable of igniting outbreaks wherever vaccination rates dip. Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leaving babies with deafness, blindness or heart defects. Mumps, too often dismissed as mild, can lead to infertility in adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programmatic consequences are equally significant. Moss pointed out that parents already complain about too many injections. Splitting MMR into separate shots would increase both the number of visits and the number of needles children face, while weakening protection against rubella and mumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every extra appointment creates barriers, especially for families with limited resources, Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Walt Orenstein, a former head of CDC's immunization program, described combination vaccines as the foundation of modern prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Combination vaccines were developed to reduce missed opportunities, increase coverage and minimize the trauma of multiple injections," he said. "Undoing that progress would put children at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles-only vaccines also don't exist in the U.S. You can't walk into a pediatrician's office or retail pharmacy and ask for a standalone shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a measles-only vaccine available in the United States, a manufacturer would need to wait for measles outbreaks to occur, in order to test the vaccine in new clinical trials. Then they'd have to submit data for FDA approval and build a production and distribution system essentially from scratch. With no market for monovalent measles vaccines, companies would also have to be convinced there was sustainable demand — something experts say is unlikely given the entrenched use of MMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recycled claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objections to combined vaccines are not new, UC Berkeley medical historian Elena Conis noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Resistance to vaccines and concerns about the form and content of vaccines is as old as vaccination itself," she said. "And concerns about combined vaccines are as old as combined vaccines themselves." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed out that even before Wakefield, parents in the 1970s were asking why they couldn't just get some vaccines separately, echoing debates over the DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New momentum to separate measles from the rubella component is also driven by a recurring myth: that the rubella vaccine "contains fetal parts." In reality, the rubella virus was originally grown in human fetal cell lines developed in the 1960s, which have been replicated ever since without further abortions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During production, the virus is purified, leaving only trace DNA or protein fragments that are broken, biologically inactive, and present at levels far below natural background levels in food or the human body. Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration confirm these levels are safe. Advocates for separating MMR often conflate this history with the false claim that vaccines contain fetal tissue. Decoupling rubella is presented as a moral corrective, even though it introduces practical barriers and undermines protection for pregnant women and babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conis also emphasized that resistance often depends on how people perceive the seriousness of each disease. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public didn't always see the various infections as equal, Conis noted. At times rubella drew more fear than measles or mumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mumps in particular, she said, "was often treated with humor rather than fear, until the MMR vaccine came along and researchers began to highlight complications like infertility and hearing loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan offers a cautionary example. In the early 1990s, Japan withdrew the combined MMR vaccine following concerns about the safety of its mumps vaccine and reverted to measles-only shots. The result was lower uptake of rubella and mumps vaccines compared to measles, leaving gaps in protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, Japan has faced repeated rubella outbreaks, including epidemics in 2013 and 2018-2019 that sickened thousands and led to cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Because of earlier policies that vaccinated only girls against rubella, large cohorts of adult men remain under-immunized, forcing costly catch-up campaigns and leaving Japan vulnerable to epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned splitting up the MMR vaccine would repeat past mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been here before. Andrew Wakefield promoted single-antigen vaccines, and it nearly derailed measles control in the U.K. The science was fraudulent, but the damage was real: thousands of kids went unprotected. To revive that model in 2025 is to repeat one of the most damaging chapters in vaccine history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columbia University historian James Colgrove noted that this kind of backlash has deep roots. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The original anti-vaccination movement in the 19th century was really a movement against state coercion," he said. "That's always been the paradox of compulsory vaccination: it's extremely effective, but it's also one of the most likely to trigger backlash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conis framed the debate in broader terms of autonomy and mandates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's always been a tension in vaccination between individual choice and public health," she said. "Parents are asked to give up some autonomy for the promise of better health for the population. For some, that's acceptable. For others, individual freedom matters more, and what's different today is that we're seeing the libertarian approach gain support at the highest levels of government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colgrove added that policymakers face a delicate balance. "The non-medical exemptions absolutely make laws more politically acceptable and are really key to diffusing backlash," he said. "At the same time, the broader your exemption, the more people you allow to opt out, then the more you risk compromising herd immunity. So it really is threading the needle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for Offit, the bigger danger is the pattern of misinformation itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These claims aren't new; they're recycled," he said. "Once doubt takes root, it's extraordinarily hard to restore public confidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from multiple countries shows that combination vaccines improve uptake and timeliness by reducing missed appointments and the number of injections required. Children receiving combination formulations are more likely to complete their full schedule on time, and low-income parents are less likely to fall behind when multiple protections are delivered in a single shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program who recently resigned, the proposal reflects politics rather than science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn't about safety. It's about ideology," he said. "We've already seen directives issued without data to back them up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the CDC's chief science and medical officer, echoed the concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The talk about separating MMR into individual components wasn't coming from scientists," she said. "It was being driven by political operatives with no public health expertise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moss: "It's not necessary, and monovalent vaccines aren't even available in the United States. There's no reason to go down that path."&lt;/p&gt;

                It's been hard for parents to get their kids COVID shots recently, as well as for many healthy adults, since the CDC hasn't weighed in with official guidelines for administering them.

   &lt;p&gt;Remy Sweeney-Garrett desperately wants to get her daughters vaccinated against COVID-19. But so far that's been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm very worried, and frustrated," says Sweeney-Garrett, 34, who lives in Seattle with her 9-year-old daughter Maxine and 18-month-old daughter Maeve. "And, yeah, I'm angry."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sweeney-Garrett hasn't been able to get her daughters the shots because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to issue final guidelines for administering them. The rules are necessary for the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt; to start shipping the vaccines to doctors, health departments and others. About half of U.S. kids are eligible for shots through the program.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm worried about my youngest daughter in particular having to go to the hospital because she is susceptible to respiratory complications," Sweeney-Garrett says. "And it's frustrating because I feel like this is within the control of the people in our government."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lag by the CDC is very unusual. Typically, the CDC acts within days – sometimes hours – because of the urgency of getting shots into arms before the winter surge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delay has created "a lot of confusion both among the public and even among providers around what the status is," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.astho.org/communications/newsroom/2025/susan-kansagra-named-astho-cmo/" target="_blank"&gt;Susan Kansagra&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sweeney-Garrett is far from alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have parents asking every day for vaccines. They want the COVID vaccine," says Dr. Elias Kass, who's the Sweeney-Garrett family's doctor. "And we don't have it. And we don't have an ETA. We don't have anything. We don't want kids to be sick. We have the opportunity to prevent that suffering. And we as a society are blowing it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's delay has also forced adults seeking vaccination to continue navigating an often confusing and frustrating patchwork of state rules that have, in many places, made it difficult if not impossible for them to get vaccinated too. Even though many states have taken steps to make it easier for people to get the vaccines, some still require prescriptions and some pharmacists are still turning away people who can't document they meet new eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's a mess. And it's an easily avoidable mess," says &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. "They chose not to take action. I think it will harm public health and the result will be more COVID-19 and more harm from it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's roll-out of the COVID vaccines has been unusually chaotic from the start. Until this year, anyone 6 months or older could get vaccinated by their pharmacist without a prescription. But for the first time this year, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;only approved the new shots&lt;/a&gt; for people at risk for serious complications because of their age or health,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538105/covid-vaccine-shots-pharmacy-fda" target="_blank"&gt; causing widespread confusion and frustration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then the CDC's powerful &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, which Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. packed with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank"&gt;like-minded anti-vaccine members, &lt;/a&gt;weighed in about the nuts and bolts of making them widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a tumultuous two-day meeting last month, Kennedy's committee recommended adding&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545946/cdc-covid-vaccine-acip-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt; a new hoop to getting vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, but also took steps that could &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540088/covid-vaccine-2025-cdc-fda-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;make more people eligible&lt;/a&gt;, let more pharmacists give the shots and start shipping the vaccines for kids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the CDC has yet to accept those recommendations— freezing everything in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a critical piece of enabling downstream access," says Kansagra of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "It's a huge problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And now with the government shut down, no one knows when the CDC might finally act or what the agency might do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Officials are especially worried because of the upcoming winter respiratory reason.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't know exactly how bad a season it could be, but it could certainly be very bad," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.bigcitieshealth.org/people/philip-huang/" target="_blank"&gt;Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Dallas Health and Human Services department in Texas. "It's very frustrating. Our jobs are being made harder rather than easier."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A 37-year-old woman’s bruising from a massage gun ended up having a cause stranger than anyone could have expected. In a recent report, doctors documented how the woman had developed the rare condition scurvy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania detailed the bizarre turn of events in a paper &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcps2500075"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the New England Journal of Medicine as part of a regular segment highlighting medically complex cases. The woman’s bruising was only the first sign of worsening health issues that eventually landed her in the hospital. Fortunately, after several false leads, her clinicians correctly diagnosed the woman’s vitamin C deficiency, and she made a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“The current case serves as a reminder that scurvy continues to occur in the United States…”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The wrong culprit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman visited the emergency room four days into having acute pain, swelling, and bruising on the upper portion of her left knee—symptoms that began after she used an electric massage gun on that area. She carried a genetic mutation that increased her general risk of blood clotting, which was managed with a blood thinner, and also had a long history of heavy menstrual bleeding. Anyone can potentially bruise or hurt themselves by applying too much pressure with a massage gun, though, and since initial tests didn’t find any other underlying reason for her symptoms, she was discharged and simply told to stop using the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, however, she visited the ER again, now with new symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath while exerting herself. She was then admitted to the hospital. The doctors suspected she had anemia caused by a lack of iron, and she was discharged with a prescription for iron pills and weekly IV infusions of iron.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Despite her treatment, her anemia and overall health continued to worsen, however. She visited the ER once more six weeks after her hospitalization with new chest pain, night sweats, and a sudden weight loss of 15 pounds. She now also had a high heart rate and low blood oxygen level, and soon enough, she was admitted to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Doctors determined she had developed pulmonary hypertension, a life-threatening type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and right side of the heart. But all of their tests continued to show no clear indication of what was causing her illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout all of this, her left leg continued to show bruising and swelling. And when doctors reexamined both legs, they found distinctive discolored spots and hairs curled up into a corkscrew shape. They also found she had developed “red-purple soft nodules” along her gums. Unlike her earlier, more general symptoms, these skin problems finally pointed to a very specific, if now rarely encountered, culprit: scurvy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When questioned, the woman admitted that she had purposefully avoided eating anything containing citrus fruits years ago, following an episode of hives that she attributed to eating citrus. Testing failed to detect any vitamin C in her system, and she was immediately started on supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just two days into her new therapy, she was discharged from the ICU and eventually the hospital as well. Her health continued to steadily improve over the next few months, and follow-up testing showed that her heart issues had cleared up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rare but still around&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the widespread knowledge that we need regular doses of vitamin C from our diets, scurvy is no longer the fearsome threat it was centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even today, doctors do still occasionally see it. Some research has also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scurvy-is-making-a-surprising-comeback-2000509979'"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of scurvy in the U.S. has climbed lately, particularly among vulnerable groups like children with sensory issues, elderly people, and others struggling to eat or afford healthy fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This case was stranger than most, though, since pulmonary hypertension usually isn’t linked to scurvy. The authors note that the condition is often hard to diagnose at first because—as is with this case—the earliest signs tend to be non-specific symptoms potentially caused by many different things. So as rare as it is, the doctors hope their report can provide doctors a timely lesson that scurvy is still around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The current case serves as a reminder that scurvy continues to occur in the United States and highlights its potential severity and clinical features,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                A new study found that artificial intelligence could design DNA for all kinds of dangerous proteins, and do it in such a way that DNA manufacturers' biosecurity screening measures would not reliably catch them.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Major biotech companies that churn out made-to-order DNA for scientists have protections in place to keep dangerous biological material out of the hands of would-be evil-doers. They screen their orders to catch anyone trying to buy, say, smallpox or anthrax genes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But now, a new &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has demonstrated how AI could be used to easily circumvent those biosafety processes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team of AI researchers found that protein-design tools could be used to "paraphrase" the DNA codes of toxic proteins, "re-writing them in ways that could preserve their structure, and potentially their function," says &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/horvitz/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eric Horvitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft's chief scientific officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The computer scientists used an AI program to generate DNA codes for more than 75,000 variants of hazardous proteins – and the firewalls used by DNA manufacturers weren't consistently able to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To our concern," says Horvitz, "these reformulated sequences slipped past the biosecurity screening systems used worldwide by DNA synthesis companies to flag dangerous orders."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A fix quickly got written that and slapped onto the biosecurity screening software. But it's not perfect — it still wasn't able to detect a small fraction of the variants.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And it's just the latest episode showing how AI is revving up long-standing concerns about the potential misuse of powerful biological tools.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The perils of open science&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"AI-powered protein design is one of the most exciting frontiers in science. We're already seeing advances in medicine and public health," says Horvitz. "Yet like many powerful technologies, these same tools can often be misused."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, biologists have worried that their ever-improving DNA tools might be harnessed to design potent biothreats, like more virulent viruses or easy-to-spread toxins. They've even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/02/17/147053720/who-panel-supports-publication-of-bird-flu-details-eventually" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;debated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether it's really wise to openly publish certain experimental results, even though open discussion and independent replication has been the lifeblood of science.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The researchers and the journal who published this new study decided to hold some of their information back, and will restrict who gets access to their data and software. They enlisted a third party, a non-profit called the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science, to make decisions about who has a legitimate need to know.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the first time such a model has been employed to manage risks of sharing hazardous information in a scientific publication," says Horvitz.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists who have been worried about future biosecurity threats for some time praised this work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My overall reaction was favorable," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3126/arturo-casadevall" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arturo Casadevall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University. "Here we have a system in which we are identifying vulnerabilities. And what you're seeing is an attempt to correct the known vulnerabilities."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The trouble is, says Casadevall, "what vulnerabilities don't we know about that will require future corrections?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that this team did not do any lab work to actually generate any of the proteins designed by AI, to see if they would truly mimic the activity of the biological original threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Such work would be an important reality check as society grapples with this kind of emerging threat from AI, says Casadevall, but would be tricky to do, as it might be precluded by international treaties prohibiting the development of biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Getting ahead of an AI "freight train"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time scientists have explored the potential for malevolent use of AI in a biological setting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a few years ago, another team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wondered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if AI could be used to generate novel molecules that would have the same properties as nerve agents. In less than six hours, the AI tool dutifully concocted 40,000 molecules that met the requested criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It not only came up with known chemical warfare agents like the notorious one called VX, but also designed many unknown molecules that looked plausible and were predicted to be more toxic. "We had transformed our innocuous generative model from a helpful tool of medicine to a generator of likely deadly molecules," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That team also didn't openly publish the chemical structures that the AI tool had devised, or create them in the lab, "because they thought they were way too dangerous," points out &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/david-relman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Relman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Stanford University. "They simply said, we're telling you all about this as a warning."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Relman thinks this latest study, showing how AI could be used to evade security screening and finding a way to address that, is laudable. At the same time, he says, it just illustrates that there's an enormous problem brewing. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it leaves us dangling and wondering, 'Well, what exactly are we supposed to do?'" he says. "How do we get ahead of a freight train that is just evermore accelerating and racing down the tracks, in danger of careening off the tracks?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns like these, some biosecurity experts see reasons to be reassured.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twist Bioscience is a major provider of made-to-order DNA, and in the past ten years, it's had to refer orders to law enforcement fewer than five times, says James Diggans, the head of policy and biosecurity at Twist Bioscience and chair of the board of directors at the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, an industry group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is an incredibly rare thing," he says. "In the cybersecurity world, you have a host of actors that are trying to access systems. That is not the case in biotech. The real number of people who are really trying to create misuse may be very close to zero. And so I think these systems are an important bulwark against that, but we should all find comfort in the fact that this is not a common scenario."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;America’s terrible year of measles is far from over. Several states have reported more cases of the vaccine-preventable viral disease as of late, while the country as a whole has hit a new record high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Michigan, California, and Illinois confirmed new cases of measles this week. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2025 has seen the highest number of cases since the disease was locally eliminated from the country a quarter century ago. Though the largest outbreaks this year have since ended, there remains a real chance measles could once again reestablish itself in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New threats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials in &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-1"&gt;Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cookcountypublichealth.org/2025/09/30/cook-county-confirms-another-measles-case/"&gt;Cook County, Illinois,&lt;/a&gt; reported a single new case of measles each this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The California case involved a toddler who had recently traveled domestically, and officials have notified people who could have been exposed to the child at a health care setting. No other community exposure is suspected, however, since the family had been isolated during the most likely period for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Illinois case involved an adult who likely caught measles from an infected individual that health officials had identified several weeks earlier. It’s the third case reported in the county this year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The largest new threat of measles comes from Minnesota, however. The Minnesota Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 new cases this week, bringing the state’s total tally to 17 this year. Seven of the cases are connected to three earlier cases, while the remaining three are unrelated and tied to international travel, presumably from areas where measles remains endemic. As is often true, all of the new Minnesota cases have occurred among people unvaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as of September 30, there have been a total of 1,544 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. so far this year, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week. 92% of these infections have involved people who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. The tally in 2025 is well above the previous modern high—1,274 cases in 2019—and is the most since 1992, which saw over 2,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good and bad news&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the positive side of things, New Mexico officially &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/9/?view=2279"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; the end of its large-scale outbreak late last week. The state had documented 100 cases of measles dating back to February 2025, the second largest outbreak of any state this year. The largest outbreak occurred in Texas, which saw 762 cases; the state &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak over in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These outbreaks didn’t end without causing their fair share of misery, however. Around 200 children have been hospitalized for measles this year in the U.S., for instance, while three have died from it—the first U.S. deaths reported in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Measles can have long-term health consequences as well. Studies have shown, for instance, that measles can &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia"&gt;induce&lt;/a&gt; a form of “immune amnesia,” causing people’s immune systems to lose their memory of other past infections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These latest cases also demonstrate that measles can easily spark new clusters of illness at a moment’s notice, particularly in regions where vaccine uptake is relatively low. Only a handful of states in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=subject%20to%20change.-,MMR%20vaccine%20coverage%20for%20kindergarteners%20by%20school%20year%20(2009%E2%80%932024),-The%20measles%2C%20mumps"&gt;currently have&lt;/a&gt; childhood vaccination rates for measles above 95%, the level at which herd immunity can reliably prevent widespread outbreaks. And even highly vaccinated states have communities where coverage is much lower than average (Texas’s overall vaccination rate in 2023 and 2024 was just a smidge below 95%, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while a majority of Americans &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/americans-are-already-sick-of-rfk-jr-poll-finds-2000665089"&gt;do still support&lt;/a&gt; vaccines and current vaccine requirements, many of the country’s leaders don’t seem to.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;downplayed&lt;/a&gt; the country’s measles outbreaks and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;regularly undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines since taking over as the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary this year, as has President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just last week, both men took the podium to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-too-much-liquid-trump-rfk-jr-still-gunning-for-vaccines-as-autism-cause-2000662667"&gt;once again endorse&lt;/a&gt; the debunked link between vaccines and autism. Trump also reiterated his support to separate the perfectly safe and effective combination measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine—a change that would undoubtedly lower vaccination rates for all three diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

According to Dr. Smith, this sign often goes unnoticed, “because we all do it to some degree. This means it allows chronic stress to go unaddressed for longer.” “How we numb stress may var,y but the function is the same. It is the trap that allows us to deny what’s really going on, as stress quietly builds in the background. Numbing out feels even more addictive when we are under stress because it offers such instant relief,” she said in a video shared on Instagram.  “Do you notice that your own personal preference for distraction and numbing creeps up and becomes more compulsive when you have a lot going on? Whether that is alcohol, food, doom scrolling, or anything else, stress nearly always comes before the need to numb and escape. And stress itself is a signal that you have been spending too much of your physical and mental resources and now need to put something back into replenish them,” she added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>斯德哥尔摩餐厅食物中毒爆发后四人患败血症- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd1g5y8755o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Four people been diagnosed with sepsis after eating at a luxury restaurant in Stockholm that has been linked to a suspected listeria outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Health authorities say at least 15 people have been treated or are under observation in hospital after dining at Coco &amp;amp; Carmen, a high-end venue in the Swedish capital's Östermalm district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Most of the dozens affected are not seriously ill, officials in Stockholm say, and so far none of those admitted to hospital have required intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It is rare for food contaminated by listeria, a bacterium, to cause a very serious infection, known as listeriosis.

(CBS12)  — &lt;/span&gt;Millions of workers spend hours sitting at desks, often with minimal movement throughout the day. But what many don't realize is that this seemingly harmless routine can lead to serious long-term health issues — particularly lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that prolonged sitting puts significant strain on the lumbar spine and surrounding muscles. According to Dr. Z, a local physical therapist and owner of Elite Therapy and Wellness, the lack of movement causes hip flexors to tighten and glute muscles to weaken, both of which contribute to lower back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The body wasn’t designed to sit still for eight or more hours a day,” Dr. Z explains. He says when you stay in one position too long — especially seated — you compress the spine, reduce blood flow, and cause muscle imbalances that lead to pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints in the United States. The American Chiropractic Association reports that up to 80% of people will experience lower back pain at some point in their lives, with sedentary lifestyles being a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/news/health/whats-good-for-you-keeping-your-heart-healthy-american-heart-association-south-florida-west-palm-beach-processed-foods-blood-pressure-cholesterol-september-4-2025" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/health/whats-good-for-you-keeping-your-heart-healthy-american-heart-association-south-florida-west-palm-beach-processed-foods-blood-pressure-cholesterol-september-4-2025" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;What's Good For You... keeping your heart healthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Stretching Solution:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? A simple, consistent stretching routine can make a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Z said even taking just five minutes every hour to stand, stretch, and move can reduce stiffness and improve posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the attached video, Dr. Z takes us through two stretches that will help open up your hips and get rid of that stiffness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other common recommended stretches include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seated spinal twists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standing hamstring stretches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kneeling hip flexor stretches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cat-cow movements for spinal mobility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These movements not only alleviate tension but also re-engage the core and glutes, which are essential for spinal support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more ways to stay up to date with your latest local news. &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/sign-up" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Sign up for our newsletter &lt;/a&gt;to get the day's top headlines delivered right to your inbox&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC/featured" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/@CBS12NewsWPEC/featured" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s vaccine policies are confusing, to say the least, particularly for the COVID vaccine. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a Senate committee last month that anyone who wants a COVID vaccine &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-kennedy-rfk-congress-senate-vaccines-covid-deaths-hospitals-efa457f139dabcce6f54c0ac2c590512"&gt;can get one&lt;/a&gt;. But senators from both parties said Kennedy’s policies were effectively preventing access to the shot, citing incidents of people being turned away at pharmacies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met last month, but some of its members—all selected by Kennedy—were themselves confused on how the panel’s actions affected vaccine access. Pharmacists have scrambled to determine if they are authorized to provide COVID vaccines and who is eligible to receive them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID vaccine access involves a complex web of federal law, national public health guidance, and state regulations that has left even health policy scholars scratching their heads. The confusion is partly the product of a national vaccination system that has been largely unified in practice despite legal and technical distinctions between state and the federal authorities. As the Trump administration has leaned into broader skepticism about vaccines and moved to restrict federal approvals and recommendations for the COVID vaccine, the system has begun to fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the COVID vaccine is broadly accessible on paper, but the confusion surrounding the administration’s policy changes has erected barriers to access in practice, particularly at pharmacies, where roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/vaccinations-administered-pharmacies-medical.html"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of COVID vaccinations last year were administered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this evolve? The policy changes began in May when Kennedy &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;unilaterally restricted&lt;/a&gt; the CDC’s COVID recommendations. He rescinded the agency’s guidance for routine COVID vaccination for healthy children, but the CDC modified the change days later to recommend that the decision to vaccinate children between 6 months and 17 years old be discussed with a health care provider. Kennedy also rescinded the CDC’s recommendation for pregnant women to receive the COVID vaccine, effectively removing the vaccine from the schedule entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the CDC’s guidance involves recommendations rather than mandates, virtually every state pegs its vaccine policies in some way to the CDC immunization schedule and or ACIP recommendations, including what vaccines pharmacists are allowed to administer. After Kennedy’s changes, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women#:~:text=Leigh%20Haldeman%2C%2033,get%20the%20shot."&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; soon emerged of pregnant women being repeatedly denied access to the vaccine at pharmacies despite recommendations from their doctors to get the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, pharmacists’ authority to vaccinate is based on state legislators, state statutes, and state regulations,” Allison Hill, the American Pharmacists Association’s (APhA) director of professional affairs, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of those state regulations either allow pharmacists to administer [Food and Drug Administration] approved vaccines or ACIP recommended vaccines.” If healthy pregnant women are a population no longer included in the CDC’s recommendations, then pharmacy access is imperiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next big change came in August when this year’s updated COVID shots were coming online. Vinay Prasad, a Kennedy ally and senior Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine official, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/health/fda-covid-vaccines-rfk-jr.html"&gt;overruled&lt;/a&gt; agency scientists and approved the vaccines only for people over 65 or those with underlying conditions putting them at risk of severe COVID. The FDA normally determines only whether a vaccine is safe and effective, and doesn’t comment on public health recommendations for the vaccine’s deployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change effectively made administering the shot to anyone else “off label.” And because many state regulations prevent pharmacists from providing off-label shots without a prescription, the FDA’s limited approval initially resulted in &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-vaccine-complicated-after-new-fda-restrictions/story?id=125106993#:~:text=In%2041%20states,District%20of%20Columbia."&gt;barriers to access&lt;/a&gt; for healthy people in large states like Florida and New York and more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/cvs-pharmacy-covid-vaccine-16-states.html"&gt;a dozen&lt;/a&gt; others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access was also limited by the timing gap between the FDA’s approval and a subsequent ACIP meeting on September 18-19 to consider recommendations for the year’s updated vaccines. The prevalence of state laws relying on ACIP recommendations meant that many pharmacists could not administer the latest vaccine until the committee recommended the new shots; in 2023, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7242e1.htm#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20protect,and%20might%20be%20updated."&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; recommendations the day after FDA approval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when ACIP met, its recommendation—that anyone 6 months and older consult with a provider about COVID vaccination—diverged from the FDA’s guidance. ACIP’s recommendation was broader, including healthy people that were excluded by the FDA’s approval. But the committee also added the additional step of a provider consultation for people over 65 before getting the shot whereas the FDA simply approved the vaccine for that cohort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers are uncertain about what ACIP’s updated recommendations mean for healthy pregnant women, a group excluded by Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html#:~:text=Vaccine-,Pregnancy,-Immuno%2Dcompromised%0A(excluding"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; to the schedule in May. Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that it’s ambiguous, but her understanding of the ACIP vote is that pregnant women are included in the broad recommendation. Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco whose work focuses on vaccine legal issues, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; she doesn’t think ACIP intended to include pregnant women in its votes, noting the committee did not expressly address Kennedy’s previous changes. The chair of ACIP’s COVID working group &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=17474"&gt;seemed to suggest&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that the votes did not address the issue of vaccination for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; asked the CDC to clarify whether ACIP’s COVID guidance includes healthy pregnant women. “ACIP’s recommendation applies to all individuals six months and older,” an HHS spokesperson said in response to the request for comment. “It includes an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19. High-risk groups [include] those who are pregnant or recently pregnant.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the cascading uncertainty, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/09/29/dopl-pharmacists-dont-need-prescription-covid-shot-eligible-consumers-utah/"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; have now changed regulations to safeguard vaccine access, including allowing pharmacists to administer the COVID vaccine without a prescription and re-anchoring vaccine rules to what &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32835/AAP-releases-evidence-based-immunization-schedule"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; recommend instead of relying on just the CDC or its vaccine advisory panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[States] are giving authority to our pharmacists to do this,” said Kates, who co-authored a recent &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of state vaccine changes. “It’s basically, ‘Here’s our recommendation that they can give COVID vaccines to anyone ages 3 and older. Or, we are changing … our regulation or language” to align with medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHIP, the health insurance industry’s trade association, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that its members would continue to cover vaccines including COVID and flu shots. The announcement came the day before the ACIP meeting, reflecting both a pointed rebuke of the committee and further fragmentation of vaccine policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people in most states should now technically be able to get the vaccine at a pharmacy. Amy Thibault, a spokeswoman for CVS, said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s pharmacies currently offer COVID vaccines to most people without a prescription in 48 states. CVS pharmacies in Georgia and Louisiana still require a prescription until the CDC formally adopts ACIP’s recommendations into the agency’s immunization schedule. Thibault added that the minimum age someone must be in order to get the vaccine at a pharmacy will vary by state rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibault also told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that in all 50 states pharmacists are able to fulfill the “clinical decision-making” role of a provider required for COVID vaccination; HHS also said in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html#:~:text=Individual%20decision%2Dmaking%20is%20referred%20to%20on%20the%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20adult%20and%20child%20immunization%20schedules%20as%20vaccination%20based%20on%20shared%20clinical%20decision%2Dmaking%2C%20which%20references%20providers%20including%20physicians%2C%20nurses%2C%20and%20pharmacists."&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that pharmacists can serve in that role. When asked whether the new consultation requirement could create workload problems for pharmacists, she said there shouldn’t be challenges: “It’s simply a conversation between the pharmacist and patient to gauge whether the patient has any questions or concerns.” Hill, the APhA director, agreed, saying the additional burden would be marginal but adding that, “It may take a little bit longer than it used to in pharmacies because the pharmacist has to have a conversation with the patient about their overall health status, underlying conditions, and just discussion about the risk and the benefits of getting the vaccination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the state changes, confusion and uncertainty about vaccine eligibility and access are still widespread among pharmacists, doctors, and patients alike. What has emerged on the ground is patchwork access with individual pharmacies and pharmacists coming to different conclusions about administering COVID vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are continued &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/covid-vaccines-are-hard-to-get-even-in-states-that-expanded-access/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of problems with vaccine access even in states that have adjusted their regulations and at large chain pharmacies, companies presumably best positioned to push out updated guidance to their stores. Independent pharmacy owners also are struggling to track the state and federal changes. “Each store manager is interpreting it differently and maybe each pharmacist is interpreting it differently. In the absence of standard guidance, that’s what happens,” Jennifer Avegno, the director of the New Orleans Health Department, &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-25/louisiana-pharmacies-make-their-own-rules-amid-confusing-covid-guidance-its-clear-as-mud#:~:text=Dr.%20Jennifer%20Avegno,that%E2%80%99s%20what%20happens.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the problem is likely due to providers’ uncertainty navigating fragmentation in vaccine policy and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/well/covid-vaccines-guidelines-fall-2025.html#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20if,policies%20didn%E2%80%99t%20require."&gt;fears&lt;/a&gt; about taking actions &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-25/louisiana-pharmacies-make-their-own-rules-amid-confusing-covid-guidance-its-clear-as-mud#:~:text=COVID%20vaccines%20are,in%20doing%20this.%E2%80%9D"&gt;they feel&lt;/a&gt; could expose them to liability or risk their licenses. National emergency authorizations and authorities exercised during the pandemic meant that pharmacists didn’t have to worry about state law versus federal guidance or even insurance coverage. “The fact that states had varying policies before, that didn’t matter in the emergency,” Kates said. “Not only was the government providing free COVID vaccines, but pharmacies, and pharmacists were all protected from any liability concern and given broad emergency authority to vaccinate anyone 3 and older, which helped get people very used to going to pharmacies [for vaccines].”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond access issues, the message coming from public health authorities like ACIP is that the vaccine is not recommended as routine, and Trump administration officials and advisers have &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-vaccines-cdc/"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt; misleading and inaccurate claims about the risks of the vaccine itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the current administration’s messaging on vaccines, the CDC had already begun moving away from recommending that providers and patients simply discuss whether to get the vaccine—a process known as shared clinical decision-making (SCDM)—because the framework created confusion for doctors and patients. For example, last June, ACIP voted to shift its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) guidance away from SCDM and to routine recommendation for specific groups. ACIP working group members noted that “[c]ompared to universal recommendations, SCDM does not have a clear call to action” and “not all providers who give vaccines are comfortable with SCDM or feel it is within their scope of practice.” They cited a 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8342675/"&gt;physician survey&lt;/a&gt; that found 76 percent of respondents thought that shared clinical decision-making creates confusion and 42 percent said they didn’t know how to implement it as intended by ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez—the administration’s own pick who spent just a month on the job. Monarez testified to Congress that she was fired because she refused to preemptively rubber-stamp ACIP’s upcoming recommendations. Monarez was replaced by a senior Kennedy aide who’s currently serving as acting CDC director. But after the latest ACIP meeting, the panel’s updated COVID recommendations—while narrower than past guidance—are broader than the FDA’s and unlike Kennedy’s May changes to the CDC schedule, they appear to include healthy pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More uncertainty about vaccine access could follow if Kennedy decides to reject ACIP’s recommendations or issue new CDC recommendations of his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dispatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 14:51:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5LVTdwVzRDTWkwZlhoaWFlMHMwY09wVl9SOEc5YjFydXg3WGo1bmFRUTA0U1VZWkZERmV1WlhpdWN6a1BuSkdiWnRsdlhTbVB0bDl1ZGNjZENvSS0wZGFyTDhDUVhTYkJEd2I3VkdydHZTcm9DQ3c</guid></item><item><title>FDA负责人表示，预计更年期症状激素治疗的“黑匣子”警告将很快发生变化- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/02/health/menopause-hrt-warning-change-makary</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9fjumi000x26nq4lln7bmm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Food and Drug Administration plans to make changes soon to the lengthy black box warning on many hormone replacement products for women with menopause symptoms, Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00042e6euz6hjv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are in serious discussions now about what to do about the black box warning, and I think you’ll hear something on it very soon,” Makary told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/chasing-life"&gt;Chasing Life&lt;/a&gt;” podcast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00052e6eqyl89zt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause treatments&lt;/a&gt; that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warn about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00062e6eydtauwl4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The warning was added after &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195120" target="_blank"&gt;a large government-funded study&lt;/a&gt; found that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had higher risks for some kinds of cancers, heart disease and stroke compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00072e6erd0ydgwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the study and the label change, prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy drugs for women dropped by more than 70%, and doctors became reluctant to prescribe them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00082e6e5s5y60wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really a tragedy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00092e6ekav5ajnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2823976?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamahealthforum.2024.3128" target="_blank"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000a2e6eeahhqn3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer analyses of the original study, called the Women’s Health Initiative, have since found that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, may safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000b2e6eq8utzfsa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also said hormone replacement therapy may also have important benefits like reducing bone loss, heart disease risk and memory loss,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000c2e6efzlmyczo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women live longer and feel better on hormone replacement therapy when started before age 60,” Makary told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000d2e6el3zwtay9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The potential change follows a July &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;meeting of experts&lt;/a&gt;, convened by the FDA, to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000e2e6e1gf8kh7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am begging the FDA, and all of us are begging, please remove the box label,” said Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “And please stop harming women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000f2e6e2vb3kdk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some women’s health experts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;say the FDA overstepped when it applied the boxed warning to all forms of estrogen replacement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000g2e6ebps4216p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That is a real mistake,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the principal investigators of the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000h2e6ezlo35gk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some forms don’t raise estrogen levels in the blood, so they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;aren’t likely to raise a woman’s cancer risk.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For example, studies have found that low doses of estrogen delivered by tablets, creams or rings in the vagina can safely treat symptoms of dryness, painful sex and urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women, Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000i2e6eo8ak6a09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The black box warning, though, may stop women from using them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000j2e6ep9nps398@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It scares them away. And even after they purchase the product, they just don’t take it,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000k2e6evbrrtjuy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is really where women are being tremendously undertreated and are suffering unnecessarily due to a boxed warning that is just class labeling. All hormone therapy products get exactly the same boxed warning, and it is really harming women,” said Manson, who is chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000l2e6e9ijl6hnx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manson said it would also be reasonable for the FDA to consider removing the warnings on estrogen-containing therapies that are delivered through the skin in patches, sprays or creams to relieve the symptoms of menopause like hot flashes and night sweats. Those deliver hormones into the bloodstream, but observational studies suggest that they have a more favorable balance of risks and benefits than pills, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000m2e6ehkbfxnpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manson feels less certain about removing the boxed warning from estrogen-containing pills that are taken by mouth, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000n2e6e5thizgat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s where it’s evidence-based and justified,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000o2e6esv56zmbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2797867" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; by the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that, in women who are past menopause, there was no net benefit to taking either estrogen alone – prescribed for women who’ve had their uterus removed – or a combination of estrogen and progestin – which is typically prescribed for women who still have their uterus – to prevent chronic health conditions such as heart disease and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000p2e6e7a4xb2au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s less clear is whether a woman who starts hormone therapies in perimenopause need to stay on them long-term to get memory, heart and bone benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000q2e6e33aad8en@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a very good question,” said Dr. Roberta Diaz Brinton, a neuroscientist who studies estrogen’s effects on the brain at the University of Arizona. “We need to answer that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000r2e6em089svhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts say there’s not enough scientific evidence to support long-term use of hormones to prevent heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease or osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000s2e6ek7txx1zv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;Four medical societies&lt;/a&gt; — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology — support the use hormones to alleviate menopausal symptoms, but they don’t recommend continued use for preventing chronic conditions like heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000t2e6ew8v7t6p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leslie Cho, who runs Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center, said she’s supportive of the idea of lifting the warning from vaginal estrogen cream. “It’s never made sense on the cream,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000u2e6e83yb1330@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Cho said she’s worried that some of the benefits being discussed are drawn from after-the-fact analyses of studies that weren’t designed to look at those outcomes in the first place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000v2e6e30si3go3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m so glad to hear the FDA chair talk about this, because then, if that’s the case, they should do a study. They should fund a study,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000w2e6e178cjacs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a world where people can get hormones prescribed over the internet, Cho said she worries too many women could start taking hormones when they have risks like high blood pressure, obesity or high cholesterol that could overshadow the benefits. Even in younger women, studies show hormones may increase the risk of dangerous blood clots, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000x2e6e9nbxedog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women have to talk to their physicians about hormone replacement therapy before they believe in all the hype that’s currently ongoing, because so much of it is hype,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Here are 5 such habits experts like &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPPpdA5DAjT/?igsh=YzBxa3M2eTJjc3pi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Vass, MD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a US-based physician, say can truly make a difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgJBVV95cUxOcmhsVmtuVXNBaE1hNDZkMWRsM0hzaVVfakU5RVp6b3R1R2FtV2tYUGNoTXp2VllBNjlRc2prdlY3dnpmc2JwbHVta0Z1U2M0a214RXRWSm5fMmN3cms2cGZIVHl1NDlTYWlwU0RlZFBSenJlLW1OMHVtVTd6aWVkS3dpeDRLa0dKZW8xY2VBU2NMa2tiZVh4b3o0M2FpRVEySEYzVEhrMVVmai1GUTFzanoyOXFCRXhPVnAyZy12Ml9GcEhWWk4xdEEzM0dOWXd5TWV5M2RHYUNFQzN6QkN5YzRSVFRNbDlZMm14OUliaC1aRG5KcVNoSlVubGI4NnF2UkZhSThjOGwwdmdVX0xvRTJvVS1wYUdHTm14Z1lSSWE2aHI3cUhFMW54NV8zcENzZUM3TEZn0gG-AkFVX3lxTE1LTEdJOTlWQUZBeTBmNWNqVExMcGFzNEtuNWJwc0xkdXllT1l6OG1QcjBlQ0Q0WnZfZDVHUXdkbVdGa3FlM3Nrd2ZPbUE2cVd4RFE0TUZld2F6UnRpX09nbkVuVFJEanVPYldIT0ZQTENuTkN2ODRoVGJzSFFHYW5xV1hJdnlhekJCTFppcUtlc0pQb3JHdjE1Z1JXZ1dxZjZuNlc3RmJBWThNZUNhS2lFTWFuWEZPMjUtS1puQ29SajZJWC1IcTd3WE5CTHZSUUNDUURNVVgzMWFTUTcxT2xMOHBwYkNuSWZ4OFVRYW9qQTR6MXlmNThXS0kybm9EZXNmaWV4Y3N4b3dkTVVaWl9rVGZ6U1Jnd0VxMnMyMFp5Ukg1aFZpbGxnV25aclpTaVZUMXNZYUM2akxSNVJBZw</guid></item><item><title>随着干细胞再生大脑，中风损伤得到逆转- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/stroke-damage-reversed-as-stem-cells-regrow-the-brain/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stem cell therapy reversed stroke damage in mice, regenerating neurons and restoring movement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The findings bring scientists closer to human treatments that could one day transform recovery after brain injury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakthrough in Stroke Recovery With Stem Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in four adults suffer a stroke in their lifetime, leaving around half of them with residual damage such as paralysis or speech impairment because internal bleeding or a lack of oxygen supply kill brain cells irreversibly. No therapies currently exist to repair this kind of damage. “That’s why it is essential to pursue new therapeutic approaches to potential brain regeneration after diseases or accidents,” says Christian Tackenberg, the Scientific Head of Division in the Neurodegeneration Group at the University of Zurich (UZH) Institute for Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells have the potential to regenerate brain tissue, as a team led by Tackenberg and postdoctoral researcher Rebecca Weber has now compellingly shown in two studies that were conducted in collaboration with a group headed by Ruslan Rust from the University of Southern California. “Our findings show that neural stem cells not only form new neurons, but also induce other regeneration processes,” Tackenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_495468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-495468" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-495468" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-777x437.jpg" alt="Human Neural Stem Cells in Culture" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-777x437.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-400x225.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-768x432.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-150x84.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-450x253.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Human-Neural-Stem-Cells-in-Culture.jpg 1777w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-495468" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human neural stem cells in culture.

&lt;h4&gt;New Neurons From Human Stem Cells&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies employed human neural stem cells, from which different cell types of the nervous system can form. The stem cells were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which in turn can be manufactured from normal human somatic cells. For their investigation, the researchers induced a permanent stroke in mice, the characteristics of which closely resemble the manifestation of stroke in humans. The animals were genetically modified so that they would not reject the human stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week after stroke induction, the research team transplanted neural stem cells into the injured brain region and observed subsequent developments using a variety of imaging and biochemical methods. “We found that the stem cells survived for the full analysis period of five weeks and that most of them transformed into neurons, which actually even communicated with the already existing brain cells,” Tackenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Brain Regeneration Beyond Neurons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found other markers of regeneration: new formation of blood vessels, an attenuation of inflammatory response processes, and improved blood-brain barrier integrity. “Our analysis goes far beyond the scope of other studies, which focused on the immediate effects right after transplantation,” Tackenberg explains. Fortunately, stem cell transplantation in mice also reversed motor impairments caused by stroke. Proof of that was delivered in part by an AI-assisted mouse gait analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Clinical Application Moving Closer to Reality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was designing the studies, Tackenberg already had his sights set on clinical applications in humans. That’s why, for example, the stem cells were manufactured without the use of reagents derived from animals. The Zurich-based research team developed a defined protocol for that purpose in collaboration with the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA) at Kyoto University. This is important for potential therapeutic applications in humans. Another new insight discovered was that stem cell transplantation works better when it is performed not immediately after a stroke but a week later, as the second study verified. In the clinical setting, that time window could greatly facilitate therapy preparation and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges, Safety Measures, and Future Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging results of the studies, Tackenberg warns that there is still work to be done. “We need to minimize risks and simplify a potential application in humans,” he says. Tackenberg’s group, again in collaboration with Ruslan Rust, is currently working on a kind of safety switch system that prevents the uncontrolled growth of stem cells in the brain. Delivery of stem cells through endovascular injection, which would be much more practicable than a brain graft, is also under development. Initial clinical trials using induced stem cells to treat Parkinson’s disease in humans are already underway in Japan, Tackenberg reports. “Stroke could be one of the next diseases for which a clinical trial becomes possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

"Thankfully, we are not seeing the same magnitude that we have seen in the past, especially among people who got sick during the early days of the pandemic. Keep in mind that that can change at any moment, depending upon the different variant mutations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there's a downside to more mundane symptoms, Dr. Evans warns: "Because these symptoms &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flu-symptoms-2025-2026" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:overlap with flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;overlap with flu&lt;/a&gt; and RSV, testing is the only way to know for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1269508/jenniferlarson/covid-booster-flu-shot-timing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Can You Get a Flu Shot and a COVID Shot at the Same Time?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Can You Get a Flu Shot and a COVID Shot at the Same Time?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Get the COVID Booster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to experts, it's absolutely worth getting a booster because it'll protect against severe cases from just about any variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The updated &lt;a href="http://parade.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19 vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; boosters are designed to target common circulating COVID-19 variants more effectively. Currently, the most common variants circulating in our communities are Nimbus and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/covid-symptoms-september-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stratus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stratus&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Boden-Albala says. "These variants should be considered part of the virus’s ongoing seasonal pattern, rather than fundamentally new threats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evans concurs, "The updated booster targets newer Omicron strains, including Nimbus. No vaccine covers every mutation, but this shot gives strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death from the strains circulating now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/when-to-see-doctor-vaccine-side-effects-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:These Are the Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;These Are the Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the Quickest Way To Get Rid of COVID Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're showing any COVID symptoms, your first step should be to take a test to determine if you have it, especially since, as Dr. Evans notes above, there are a lot of viruses and illnesses this time of year with overlapping symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, congestion, fatigue or loss of taste or smell, use an at-home antigen or PCR test to check," Dr. Boden-Albala says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do get infected, there are steps you can take to feel better faster than, say, just moaning about your misery (though you'd be well within your rights to do so, because having COVID really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sucks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Remain at home as much as possible, allowing your body to fight the infection and recover," Dr. Boden-Albala tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;. "Remember, usually for COVID-19 it takes about five days for symptoms to subside.  It's important to avoid close contact with others to reduce the transmission of the virus to other people. If you’re at high risk of severe illness (e.g., immunocompromised or elderly) or really feel very sick, seek medical advice promptly—antiviral treatments like Paxlovid can be effective if started soon after symptoms begin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora also urges anyone who's infected to get to a doctor, especially if you're in a high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical trials have demonstrated that Paxlovid reduces the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% in adults who are at high risk for severe illness and take the medication within three days of symptom onset," she says. "Paxlovid has also been shown to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, with patients who take the medication experiencing shorter illness durations and lower viral loads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can't get to a doctor, you still have options to help feel less crummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have had COVID twice," Dr. Greenspan tells us. He shares what he called his "personal cocktail of choice" to treat symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen: 400 mg twice per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby aspirin: 81 mg twice per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famotidine: 20 mg twice per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One loratadine and pseudoephedrine 12-hour tablet twice per day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplemental oxygen if you have access to it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an airway clearance device to help remove mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrolytes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your own needs and symptoms may be different, so don't feel like you need to take Dr. Greenspan's list as gospel, especially if you're on any other medications that may interact with these!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/covid-brain-aging-study-july-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID Had a Scary Impact on Brain Health—Here’s What to Do;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID Had a Scary Impact on Brain Health—Here’s What to Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the Best Way To Protect Against COVID-19 Right Now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting vaccinated and boosted is still your best line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aside from protecting from hospitalization and severe symptoms from COVID-19, evidence suggests that being up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccines can reduce the risk of developing long COVID," Dr. Mora says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health prevention efforts remain the best advice for reducing risks around COVID-19. It is critical to be up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines," Dr. Boden-Albala agrees. "Remember, the updated COVID-19 vaccines are designed to target current COVID-19 circulating variants more effectively. Staying up to date with COVID-19 boosters offers the best protection against severe illness, especially for people with higher risk factors such as older age or being pregnant, which can impact immunity or pre-existing health conditions. Maintaining a strong baseline of health through rest, nutrient-rich food, and stress reduction can support immune resilience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one exception? If you have a current or recent infection, you may want to wait a bit before getting the jab, Dr. Evan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wait until you recover and finish isolation before getting vaccinated," he explains. "The CDC advises about three months after infection for the best immune response, unless your doctor recommends sooner based on your health risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you had COVID somewhat recently and want extra protection ahead of the busy holiday season when we're all going to be crowding around indoors, don't fret too much. Dr. Mora says, "People should wait at least two weeks after an active COVID-19 infection or until COVID-19 infection symptoms are completely resolved before getting COVID-19 booster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're vaccinated, however, don't think you're completely in the clear, Dr. Greenspan warns. "One key point that I will always emphasize is that the more times you have COVID, the greater your chances of developing long COVID, so it is not something that I would completely ignore or feel as if there is zero threat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, you'll also want to mask up in crowded places, test if you show any symptoms, isolate if you're infected and avoid others who may be infected. Frequent handwashing never hurt, either, so &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don't be lazy and gross after using a public bathroom, OK? It's for your own good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flu-symptoms-2025-2026" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: These Are the Most Common Symptoms of the Flu That Doctors Are Seeing Right Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/boden-albala-dr-bernadette/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bernadette Boden-Albala, MPH, DrPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Bernadette Boden-Albala, MPH, DrPH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tylerevansmd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Tyler B.

A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983" target="_self"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; of colonoscopy patients revealed that most used their phones on the toilet at least once a week -- and that those phone-on-the-toilet users showed a 46% increased risk for hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;The cause and effect are clear. Caught up in news or games or social media, bathroom users stay seated on the throne longer, with research showing phone users tend to spend more than 5 minutes doing their business. The study says that hemorrhoids are associated with prolonged sitting on the toilet, as well as constipation and increased straining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Add%20CNET%22%7D" target="_self"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; as a preferred Google source.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 125 colonoscopy patients at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Study who participated in the study answered questions about their bathroom phone habits, and endoscopists evaluated their hemorrhoids (just in case you think you have a bad job). Of all the respondents, 66% used smartphones while sitting on the toilet, and those participants tended to be younger than those who didn't. More than one-third (37.3%) of smartphone users spent more than 5 minutes sitting on the toilet per visit, while only 7.1% of those without smartphones spent that long seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the numbers were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, exercise activity and "straining and fiber intake," results showed a 46% increased risk for hemorrhoids. Men were more likely than women to spend 6 minutes or more on the toilet, in case you wondered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who used smartphones while on the toilet also admitted to getting less exercise than those who didn't, which the researchers said "could signify a higher level of engagement with technology and a more sedentary lifestyle outside of the toileting environment." (Yes, "toileting environment." Otherwise known as just "the toilet.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common toilet phone activity was reading news, with 54.3% admitting to doing so, and 44.4% saying they were participating in social media while on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn't directly connect constipation with time spent on the toilet, but Dr. Eamonn Quigley, chairman of gastroenterology at Houston Methodist, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/well/phone-use-toilet-hemorrhoids-constipation.html" target="_self"&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that it's likely those who sit hunched over their phones while on the toilet might be more likely to experience constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're grossed out by the idea of your phone being in close connection with toilet time, you're not alone. Doctors told the NYT the obvious: Fecal material can get on your hands while you're wiping and be transferred to your phone, and flushing with the toilet lid open can also spray fecal matter onto your phone. Sure, you wash your hands, but now the stuff is on your phone, so it jumps right back on your hands after you dry them and start scrolling again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, you're probably going to scroll your phone while occupied in the bathroom. But this study notes that you should be aware that the phone's fun distractions might make you sit there longer than you planned, and that could have painful consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 13:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNaW1LV0g3M29NcVROdGxzdy04SzhiVDhQM2JhMlRYWEhGdzEyWmVBb2JFczFHWXBETzlpOEpaXzdiY1ZjNUNmSUx6RGE2dmNtQVNqa0ZSOVh0aDd4Y1lyWU9BRFZlYmd1LXBqQm1Bc1JmVmRycjVnZ1U1M3VLNkZ4N05RZml4OXR5cm9PMEhVR0ItYkl1bFlFNXMtdlh1OW5ybEE</guid></item><item><title>研究将自闭症的起源追溯到人类智力的崛起- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/study-traces-autisms-origin-to-the-rise-of-human-intelligence</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study finds  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; may lie at the crux of what makes humans uniquely intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that some of the same genetic changes that make the human brain unique also made humans more neurodiverse," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1096746"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stanford University neuroscientist Alexander Starr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both autism and schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental brain differences that can have a mix of negative and positive impacts (including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-015-2518-2"&gt;increased creativity&lt;/a&gt;), to be very clear, the new study's findings don't indicate that neurodivergent people are more or less intelligent; that's not at all what was measured here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, the researchers found that genes responsible for human intellect also increase our chances of having autistic or &lt;span&gt;schizophrenic&lt;/span&gt; traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-can-boost-cognitive-performance-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;Autism Can Boost Cognitive Performance, And We May Finally Know Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is rare to find the behavioral traits of autism or schizophrenia in non-human primates, Starr and colleagues suspected there may be a genetic reason these conditions seem to be unique to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they compared RNA from over a million cells across three brain regions in six mammalian species: mice, marmosets, rhesus macaques, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that generally, the most common types of brain cells stayed relatively unchanged, even between species. There was one major exception, however: the most abundant type of neocortical neurons, layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons, changed much quicker in humans than other primates across evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same pattern was confirmed across multiple databases, and using brain  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; made from chimp and human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"&gt;neocortical&lt;/a&gt; part of the brain is involved with high-order functioning, including cognition, reasoning, and language. The rapid transformation of specialized neurons in this region includes changes in genes associated with autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175791" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175791" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RareBrainCellTypesWereTheOnesThatExperiencedChangeBetweenHumansAndOtherPrimates-e1759189119404.jpg" alt="Autism May Be a Trade-Off For Human Genius, Study Finds" class="wp-image-175791 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RareBrainCellTypesWereTheOnesThatExperiencedChangeBetweenHumansAndOtherPrimates-e1759189119404.jpg 641w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RareBrainCellTypesWereTheOnesThatExperiencedChangeBetweenHumansAndOtherPrimates-e1759189119404-600x217.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175791" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As the researchers predicted, the strongest selection pressure was detected on brain cell types that were rarer in most primates. (Starr et al., &lt;em&gt;MBE&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's still unclear why these genes helped our human ancestors survive&lt;/span&gt;, but as some of the genes have been associated with a delay in brain development, the researchers suspect these changes may have helped increase our capacity for language and complex thinking. These traits have clear advantages, even if they also increase the chances of certain neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best-known example of this type of evolutionary trade-off is in human populations living in regions with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="175785" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;. People here have a higher chance of developing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876"&gt;sickle cell anemia&lt;/a&gt; because the gene behind the condition also conveys a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-our-red-blood-cells-keep-evolving-to-fight-malaria-96117"&gt;30 percent reduction in susceptibility&lt;/a&gt; to the malaria parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date supporting the long-standing hypothesis that natural selection for human-specific traits has increased the likelihood of certain disorders," Starr and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf189"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They caution, however, that while they have established a correlation, more research is required to understand the drivers of the strong selection forces they've uncovered. If their suspicions are correct, it would mean humans wouldn't exist as we are without the existence of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, a little over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html"&gt;3 in 100 children in the US&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with &lt;span&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/span&gt;. This is controversially increasing (only slightly, to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/autism-is-not-a-scare-story-what-parents-need-to-know-about-medications-in-pregnancy-genetic-risk-and-misleading-headlines-264964"&gt;about 4 in 100&lt;/a&gt;), due to increased awareness of autistic traits and the broadening of diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-finds"&gt;adds to&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02009-6"&gt;mountain of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that autism is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.07.015"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt;, with up to 80 percent of cases linked to inherited gene mutations.

&lt;p&gt;You know how every dog has their own “thing?” Some are professional couch potatoes, while others act like wannabe sprinters at the park. Then there’s Oatmeal. Not only is this &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; wholesome and comforting, just like his name, but he’s also an expert in making lake day funnier, as can be seen in this video.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His mom, who posts about his adventures on @adriaandoatmeal, filmed him in Lake Tahoe, striking poses that honestly make him look more like a human than a dog. The clip has been making the rounds online for all the right reasons, because when Oatmeal decides to put on a show, it’s equal parts impressive and hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-owner-shows-golden-retriever-s-impressive-skills-in-lake-video"&gt;Owner shows Golden Retriever’s impressive skills in lake video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The video drew over 10.9K likes and plenty of comments from fans who were seriously impressed by Oatmeal’s water skills. Golden Retrievers are bred to be excellent water dogs. They are intelligent, highly trainable, and extremely focused when given a task. Oatmeal is showing off these traits by standing nearly upright in the water, three-quarters submerged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He shuffles his feet, balancing exceptionally well. His human is amazed: “Wait, this is actually really impressive,” she says. He then strikes a pose, leading his mom to exclaim, “This is his hunting stance, by the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the hunt is secretive, his mom tries to give him a mission: “Do you want to get that rock for me?” Oatmeal swims right up to her, ready for instructions. While there’s a little mix-up with which rock he’s supposed to grab, his determination doesn’t waver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He approaches a rock on the lake bed, feeling it out with a paw. He then dunks his head under the water to grab his prize. “Yay, good boy,” his mom cheers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The feat is so impressive that even his friend, Crusty Carl, is seen celebrating his success. One fan called it “top-tier hunting stance.” Another commenter was equally impressed by his aquatic gymnastics: “No arm floaties and balancing on back legs is hella impressive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: My daughter was recently visiting and tested positive for COVID. Since my last COVID vaccine was eight months ago, I searched for how much protection I still had and understood the response to be little to none. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5TSLBKBR35BMNJUZR7UGW4SXMQ"&gt;So, why is the recommendation for vaccination only once per year and not more frequent so that we always have some protection? -- B.J.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F54ZCL6T75AFVDA2OQLDZP4YEM"&gt;ANSWER: The vaccine ideally provides immunity to an infection. Many of the best vaccines that we recommend provide high-level immunity against getting the disease, although there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BAWSEEXUNBD2TA5RTQCIN67YZE"&gt;The mRNA COVID vaccines provide 85% to 90% protection for the first three months or so, but the immunity wanes to only 50% to 60% effectiveness against getting the disease after six to eight months. The vaccine efficacy depends on the particular vaccine and precise variant of COVID. So, you are right that the vaccine you got eight months ago provides little protection against getting the disease now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2ZROTX76ARAZLF2DUFKNI2OHZA"&gt;However, the vaccine also protects people against severe diseases and the currently circulating variants of COVID, even if it can’t protect you as well in getting the disease at all. The likelihood of hospitalization and death is decreased for much longer after vaccination, especially if a person has had multiple vaccines. This protection extends for a year and possibly longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FTMP5S3CSJDERNUMCEWERMWLDU"&gt;Getting vaccines twice yearly is not harmful and would provide more consistent (but still not perfect) protection, but once yearly vaccination does protect against severe diseases, including hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7KLLF2HTZ5GYJHBEPTDGCTCCVM"&gt;People with immune systems that don’t work perfectly, such as the elderly, and people who are on medicines that affect the immune system (such as organ transplantation, chemotherapy, and some treatments for severe autoimmune diseases) will not respond as well to the vaccine. So, they may particularly benefit from more frequent vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QTDVVZ4H55BHHAASSR3F6XCJRE"&gt;Another prevention option for people with severe immune system diseases is a monoclonal antibody called pemivibart, which is given by an intravenous infusion. It can be given every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O5Q5AGJ3NFHK7NDYSMN4Z5GKX4"&gt;The decision to get vaccinated should be up to a patient and their physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: A beloved cousin of mine was given the wrong type of blood as a teenager and subsequently died. I, myself, am type O Rh-negative. What are the odds of this happening today, and how can this be prevented? Is this a huge problem in this country, and if one is traveling abroad, how can the hospital staff be alerted? Is the blood tested before every transfusion? -- R.P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GLK64DJPEJAWLDDYBVZ7VJVFB4"&gt;ANSWER: I am very sorry about your cousin. This is an extraordinarily rare event, with four definite cases occurring in the United States (out of 10 million transfusions) in the most recently reported year. It should never happen; there are supposed to be multiple layers of protection to keep this from occurring. A person who is O-negative, like you, is at the highest risk for a transfusion reaction as you can only safely get O-negative blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5CRPQSSZWRBGXFFHR37I4NCTJQ"&gt;Blood is absolutely tested before every transfusion with limited exceptions. In a true emergency, sometimes O-negative blood is given without crossmatching. This is only the case when a person is at a very high risk of dying before crossmatching can be done. This reduces the risk of severe transfusion reactions, but there are other blood antigens beyond the ABO system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HMCN6ISRCJEDTKYJK3P2QP3WBU"&gt;While developed countries have similar policies to the U.S., it is possible that the blood supply will not be as safe in underdeveloped countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NILFEPP65BBUZNVHCDXETUAVXU"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4K7MDEJVLZDFBHKWPZC7WFEBL4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.
